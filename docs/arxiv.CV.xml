Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding, comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs, highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and propose promising research directions.

<div> method, negative prompt guidance, image generation models, few-step diffusion, flow-matching

Summary:
The Value Sign Flip (VSF) method introduces a simple and efficient way to incorporate negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching image generation models. Unlike existing approaches, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. This method shows superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs. VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence in few-step models compared to prior methods and even outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality. The method integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures and cross-attention-based models, making it versatile for various model types. The code and ComfyUI node for VSF are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

<div> camera localization, retail environments, Relative Pose Regression, Auto-Encoders, data efficiency 

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of accurate camera localization in retail settings and introduces a novel approach that combines Absolute Pose Regression (APR) and Relative Pose Regression (RPR) using Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs). The PAE-based RPR is shown to be effective in enhancing localization accuracy by incorporating visual and spatial scene priors. The study compares PAE-based RPR with image-based RPR models and demonstrates the superiority of the former. A refinement strategy is proposed, which refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. The method significantly improves localization accuracy on indoor benchmarks and achieves competitive performance even with limited training data. This approach reduces the data collection burden for retail deployment, making it a practical solution for enhancing customer experiences and streamlining operations in retail environments. <div>

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments, enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs) have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR, without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios, including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around 100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI systems.

<div> Proposal Generator, Pseudo-labels, Geometric Quality, Open-Vocabulary, Detection <br>
Summary: <br>
The article introduces HQ-OV3D, a framework aimed at enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary 3D detection. Traditional closed-set methods fall short in open-world applications like autonomous driving, prompting the need for improved detection frameworks. HQ-OV3D consists of an IMCV Proposal Generator for high-quality 3D proposals and an ACA Denoiser for refining proposals using geometric priors from annotated classes. By leveraging cross-modality consistency and a DDIM-based denoising mechanism, the framework significantly improves bounding box precision and achieves a 7.37% mAP increase on novel classes compared to existing methods. HQ-OV3D not only functions as a standalone detector but also as a high-quality pseudo-label generator for other open-vocabulary detection pipelines, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in addressing the limitations of current methods. <br> <div>
arXiv:2508.10935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision, remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA) Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary detection or annotation pipelines.

<div> Sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting, collaborative perception, 3D semantic occupancy prediction, connected vehicles, communication efficiency<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
This article introduces a new approach for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction in connected vehicles. By utilizing sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting, the method enhances communication efficiency by sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian primitives. This approach offers neighborhood-based cross-agent fusion, joint encoding of geometry and semantics, and sparse, object-centric messages. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods in mIoU and IoU metrics. Even with reduced communication volume, the method maintains robust performance, demonstrating a significant improvement in mIoU using only a fraction of the original communication budget. <div>
arXiv:2508.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information, overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU, respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6% communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited communication budgets.

<div> Keywords: face super-resolution, extreme degradation, identity consistency, masking, warping

Summary:
The article introduces a novel face super-resolution method called IDFSR, which aims to enhance identity restoration under extreme scaling factors while reducing hallucination effects. The method involves masking unreliable identity cues in low-resolution images, warping a reference image for style guidance, and utilizing identity embeddings for fine-grained ID modeling. The approach first pretrains a diffusion-based model to decouple style and identity and then fine-tunes the identity embedding using target ID images for personalized adaptation. The IDFSR method significantly improves identity consistency and perceptual quality, outperforming existing approaches under extreme degradation conditions. Extensive evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of IDFSR in preserving critical attributes and ID information in super-resolved faces. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID) consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios (e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects. Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2) \textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT) images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID consistency.

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management. Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3, and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum, Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

Summary:
Artcodes are decorative markers that encode information into their topology, blending into their surroundings. Recognizing these Artcodes, a form of topological objects, is crucial for interacting with virtual elements in our environment. A new feature descriptor called the shape of orientation histogram is proposed to represent the topological structure of Artcodes. Through experiments and dataset collection, the feasibility and effectiveness of this feature descriptor in detecting Artcode proposals are demonstrated. This innovative system paves the way for detecting similar topological objects, creating new interaction possibilities and potential applications in the detection of topological objects like Artcodes.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection, a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark potential applications of topological object detection.

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting -- characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance. This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT). In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of 50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822 and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based structural analysis of composite preforms.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection, Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000 frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable, offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at https://smlab.niser.ac.in/project/iwatchroad

It introduces Incremental Patch Generation (IPG) as a method to efficiently generate adversarial patches, demonstrating its ability to create well-generalized patches that cover a broad range of model vulnerabilities. The efficacy of IPG is supported by experiments and ablation studies, showing its potential to enhance AI model robustness. The generated datasets can also be used to build a robust defense system for AI security.

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore, IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction, multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of robust and trustworthy medical AI.

Summary:
FastFOD-Net is a newly optimized deep learning framework designed to enhance Fiber Orientation Distributions (FODs) in diffusion MRI data. The framework has been validated across healthy controls and six neurological disorders, showcasing superior performance and efficiency compared to previous methods. By providing an accelerated and robust enhancement of FODs, FastFOD-Net has the potential to accelerate clinical neuroscience research, enable more precise diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, enhance interpretability in connectome applications, and reduce measurement errors to lower sample size requirements. The comprehensive clinical evaluation of FastFOD-Net demonstrates its capability to analyze real-world clinical diffusion MRI data effectively, making it comparable to high-quality research acquisitions. This work paves the way for widespread adoption of deep learning-based methods in diffusion MRI enhancement and builds trust in their use in clinical settings. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders. This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with high-quality research acquisitions.

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data, poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance. Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools: (1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities, offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

<div> Representative types, reasoning levels, object property dimensions, VQA benchmark, ORBIT  
Summary:  
ORBIT introduces a new evaluation framework for vision-language models (VLMs) in the context of object property reasoning in visual question answering (VQA). The benchmark consists of 360 images paired with count-based questions that test reasoning skills at varying levels of complexity. By evaluating 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on this benchmark, the study highlights significant limitations in the models' ability to abstract and reason over depicted objects when compared to human performance. VLMs struggle with realistic images, counterfactual reasoning about object properties, and higher counts. The findings suggest a need for scalable benchmarking methods, generalized annotation guidelines, and further exploration of reasoning VLMs in the field. The ORBIT benchmark and experimental code are made publicly available to support future research in this area.  
<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic (photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available to support such endeavors.

<br>
Summary: <br>
The study focuses on using hyperspectral imaging to improve automotive perception systems' ability to protect Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) by overcoming visual ambiguity caused by metamerism. By capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum, particularly in the Near-Infrared (NIR), the study aims to enhance VRU separability from the background. A band selection strategy integrating information theory techniques and an image quality metric identified three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm) in the Hyperspectral City V2 dataset. Quantitative results demonstrated increased dissimilarity and perceptual separability of VRU from the background, with significant improvements in dissimilarity and perception metrics compared to RGB imaging. The selected HSI bands consistently outperformed RGB, reducing metameric confusion and enhancing VRU separability, which is essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) to improve road safety. <div>

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum, especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB. Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity (Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability, establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately contributing to improved road safety.

<div> control generation, DiT-ControlNet, EVCtrl, spatio-temporal dual caching, efficiency

Summary:
EVCtrl is a lightweight control adapter for visual generation models such as DiT-ControlNet, aimed at reducing latency and redundant computation. By utilizing a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy, EVCtrl efficiently handles sparse control information without requiring model retraining. It profiles layer responses to control signals and partitions the network into global and local functional zones to focus computation on relevant areas. Additionally, EVCtrl selectively skips denoising steps to enhance temporal efficiency. Experimental results on various datasets show significant speedups with minimal impact on generation quality. For instance, EVCtrl achieves notable speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet. This approach provides a practical solution for achieving controlled image and video generation without compromising performance. EVCtrl's codes are also available for further investigation and implementation. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Summary: 
- Vision language models (VLMs) have shown the ability to simulate general human behavior but have not been explored in the accessibility domain. 
- A benchmark dataset was created through a survey study with low vision participants to evaluate VLMs' simulation capabilities in interpreting images. 
- VLMs tend to infer beyond specified vision abilities when given minimal prompts, resulting in low agreement with participants' responses. 
- Providing a combination of vision information and example image responses significantly increases agreement between VLM-generated responses and participants' answers. 
- Combining open-ended and multiple-choice responses offers significant performance improvements over either type alone, while additional examples provide minimal benefits.

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant, varying the included information on vision information and example image responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants' responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

<div> Keywords: construction safety inspections, Vision Language Models (VLMs), dataset, image captioning, safety rule violation

Summary: 
Construction safety inspections traditionally rely on human inspectors to identify safety concerns on-site. The use of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is being explored for tasks like detecting safety rule violations in on-site images, but there is a lack of open datasets for comprehensive evaluation. The ConstructionSite 10k dataset, comprising 10,000 construction site images, addresses this gap by providing annotations for tasks including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs show promising generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings but require additional training for practical application in construction sites. The ConstructionSite 10k dataset serves as a benchmark for researchers to train and evaluate VLMs with new architectures and techniques, enhancing the field of construction safety inspection.

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets, limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques, providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Summary: This study explores the effectiveness of various state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models in detecting fraudulent documents. The models were tested on a standard dataset containing real transactional documents, evaluating their ability to identify indicators of fraud such as tampered text and inconsistent formatting. The results showed that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrated superior zero-shot generalization, surpassing conventional methods on out-of-distribution datasets. Vision LLMs, however, exhibited inconsistent or subpar performance. The study also found that the size of the model and advanced reasoning capabilities did not necessarily correlate with detection accuracy, highlighting the importance of task-specific fine-tuning. This research suggests that multi-modal LLMs have the potential to enhance document fraud detection systems and provides a basis for future investigations into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models (LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus, Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text, misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance. Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37% on multi-task evaluations.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces a new 3D question answering dataset called MV-ScanQA that challenges models to integrate information from multiple views for deeper scene understanding. To help train models for this task, the TripAlign dataset is introduced, providing rich multimodal alignment signals for contextually related objects. The LEGO method is developed as a baseline approach for multi-view reasoning, leveraging pre-trained 2D LVLMs and TripAlign pre-training. Empirical results show that LEGO, pre-trained on TripAlign, achieves state-of-the-art performance on MV-ScanQA and other 3D vision-language benchmarks. This work addresses limitations in existing datasets and promotes advancements in 3D vision-language learning. datasets and code are available for further research and development.

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

<div> Keywords: BMI, type 2 diabetes, body composition, abdominal patterns, clinical imaging

Summary:
- Elevated BMI is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, but the disease can also occur in lean individuals and be absent in some with obesity.
- Detailed body composition analysis can reveal abdominal phenotypes related to type 2 diabetes risk.
- AI can extract size, shape, and fat content measurements from 3D abdominal imaging to define body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk using large clinical data.
- Study found shared type 2 diabetes signatures across different weight classes, including factors like fatty skeletal muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or fat-laden pancreas.
- Univariate logistic regression confirmed the importance of top predictors in each subgroup, supporting the consistency of abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes across weight classes.

<br><br>Summary: 
Elevated BMI increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, but the disease can manifest in lean individuals as well. Analyzing detailed body composition through AI-enabled 3D imaging can unveil abdominal patterns associated with type 2 diabetes risk. The study identified common signatures across different weight classes, such as fatty skeletal muscle, older age, higher visceral and subcutaneous fat levels, and pancreatic characteristics. Univariate logistic regression reaffirmed the significance of top predictors within each subgroup, indicating consistent abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes regardless of weight categories. <div>

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese (n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns (clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences (classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74. There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of 14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be consistent across weight classes.

Summary: 
HierOctFusion addresses the challenges of 3D content generation by introducing a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model. It leverages hierarchical feature interaction and a cross-attention conditioning mechanism to enhance the generation of fine-grained and sparse object structures. By considering semantic part hierarchies and enabling effective propagation of part-level information during the generation process, HierOctFusion significantly improves shape quality and efficiency compared to existing methods. The proposed model utilizes a 3D dataset with part category annotations to facilitate training and evaluation, showcasing superior performance in generating realistic 3D objects. By incorporating part-awareness and leveraging hierarchical features, HierOctFusion demonstrates advancements in the generation of complex 3D structures efficiently and effectively. <br> <div>
arXiv:2508.11106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion, a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole. Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and efficiency compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Improper sitting posture during prolonged computer use has become a significant public health concern. Traditional posture monitoring solutions face substantial barriers, including privacy concerns with camera-based systems and user discomfort with wearable sensors. This paper presents UWB-PostureGuard, a privacy-preserving ultra-wideband (UWB) sensing system that advances mobile technologies for preventive health management through continuous, contactless monitoring of ergonomic sitting posture. Our system leverages commercial UWB devices, utilizing comprehensive feature engineering to extract multiple ergonomic sitting posture features.

Summary: 
The article introduces a residual-based efficient bidirectional diffusion model (RBDM) that can translate between hazy and haze-free images. This model uses dual Markov chains to shift residuals and enable smooth transitions between haze-free and hazy images. By perturbing the images at individual timesteps and predicting noise in the data, the model learns conditional distributions for both dehazing and haze generation. To improve performance on small datasets and reduce computational costs, the method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches. The RBDM can implement bidirectional transitions with just 15 sampling steps and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images, lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Summary:<br>
Existing rumor detection methods often overlook image content and relationships between contexts and images at different scales. This paper introduces the Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC) which utilizes contrastive learning to generate unified semantic embeddings for text and multi-scale images. A Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is used to identify relevant image regions to textual semantics.

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC). Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics, guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical applications.

Abstract: LEARN is a layout-aware diffusion framework designed to generate pedagogically aligned illustrations for STEM education. It leverages a curated BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues, enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the first generative approach to unify layout-based storytelling, semantic structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released to facilitate future research and practical deployment.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new semi-supervised image dehazing method called EM-B3DM that aims to improve the dehazing of real-world images with thick haze. The method utilizes the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to separate the joint distribution of paired hazy and clear images into conditional distributions, which are then modeled using a Bidirectional Brownian Bridge diffusion model. In a two-stage learning scheme, a pre-trained model and unpaired hazy and clear images are leveraged to enhance dehazing performance. Additionally, a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution block is introduced to capture gradient-level information and improve representation capability. Experimental results demonstrate that EM-B3DM outperforms or matches the performance of state-of-the-art dehazing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty, especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing. Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Summary: 
The study introduces a Vision foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR) for Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) in remote sensing images. It leverages a small amount of labeled target data and incorporates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) to improve the detector's feature-extraction capability and mitigate noisy pseudo-labels. A VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy and a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method are proposed to enhance the quality of pseudo-labels and align detector features with VFM embeddings at instance and image levels. The approach effectively addresses training collapse issues caused by noisy pseudo-labels and complex backgrounds in remote sensing imagery, leading to superior performance in source-free remote sensing detection tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner, leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed, which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

Summary:
IOVQA is a novel fine-tuning approach designed to improve vision language models' performance in video quality assessment tasks. The method focuses on precise label construction and targeted loss calculation to enhance model accuracy and consistency. By using integer labels within a specific range and implementing a target-mask strategy during loss calculation, IOVQA ensures numerical stability and forces the model to learn critical components of video evaluation. Experimental results show that fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL model using IOVQA significantly improves accuracy, leading to a 3rd place ranking in the VQualA 2025 GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge Track I. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of leaving integer labels during fine-tuning for optimizing vision language models in quantitative evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability, and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025 GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative evaluation scenarios.

<div> Continuous category discovery, CCD, novel categories, unlabeled data, catastrophic forgetting

Summary: 
The proposed method, IDOD, addresses the challenges of continuous category discovery by focusing on independent enrichment of diversity, joint discovery of novelty, and continuous increment by orthogonality. It avoids the contradiction between novel class discovery and classification by training the backbone separately using contrastive loss and reducing error accumulation through single-stage novel class discovery. The orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead via representative representation replay. Experimental results demonstrate that IDOD outperforms existing methods on challenging fine-grained datasets. <div>

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module, and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment, the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact. Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category) textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category) textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process. Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories, attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

Summary:
The Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT) is introduced as a video tokenizer that utilizes a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting approach to improve spatial adaptability and generalization by allocating rendering weights based on information content. It incorporates the Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Embedding mechanism for representing latent features with 2D Gaussians. GVT also employs a Gaussian Set Partitioning strategy to separate static and dynamic content, enhancing temporal versatility and compact representation. Evaluation on video reconstruction, action recognition, and compression tasks shows that GVT achieves state-of-the-art quality in reconstruction, outperforms baseline models in action recognition, and performs comparably in compression. <div>

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp., lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction, while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality, outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers comparable compression performance.

<div> camera height, monocular 3D object detection, depth estimation, data augmentation, generalization 

Summary:<br>
This paper addresses the issue of monocular 3D object detectors struggling with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. The study examines the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art Mono3D models using the CARLA dataset. It is found that depth estimation plays a crucial role in performance under height variations. The research reveals consistent trends in mean depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models when camera height changes. To address this challenge, a novel approach called CHARM3R is proposed, which averages depth estimates within the model. CHARM3R significantly enhances the generalization to unseen camera heights, improving performance by over 45% and achieving state-of-the-art results on the CARLA dataset. The codes and models for CHARM3R are available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art (SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than $45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at https://github.com/abhi1kumar/CHARM3R

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car maintenance require expert knowledge, especially when tasks are complex and multi-step. Despite growing interest in AI agents, there is a scarcity of dialogue-video datasets grounded for real world task assistance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person instructional videos into task-guidance two-person dialogues, aligned with fine grained steps and video-clips. Our fully automatic approach, powered by large language models, offers an efficient alternative to the substantial cost and effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636 question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable device. We establish the baseline benchmark performance on HowToDIV dataset through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for procedural-task assistance.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

<div> Knowledge Distillation, Human Pose Estimation, Coarse-to-Fine, Two-Stage, Graph Convolutional Network

Summary:
Our proposed method addresses the challenge of lightweight yet accurate human pose estimation by introducing a two-stage knowledge distillation framework. The first stage incorporates a human joints structure loss to capture contextual information among human joints and transfer high-level semantic knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. In the second stage, an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) refines the initial pose prediction and is trained progressively with guidance from the final output pose of the teacher model. Experimental results on COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly excelling on the more complex CrowdPose dataset. Our method showcases significant improvements in human pose estimation accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches. While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Summary: <br>
Recent advancements in audio-driven portrait animation have shown promising results, but challenges remain in aligning with various human preferences like motion naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. To address this, the researchers introduce Talking-Critic, a model that learns human-aligned reward functions to quantify video satisfaction across multiple dimensions. They also create a large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset called Talking-NSQ and develop the TLPO framework. TLPO decouples preferences into expert modules, which are then fused for comprehensive enhancement without interference. The Talking-Critic model surpasses existing methods in aligning with human preference ratings, while TLPO significantly improves lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and visual quality in portrait animation models. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Summary: <br><br> This article introduces DeCLIP, a framework designed to improve dense visual perception tasks by enhancing CLIP with decoupled self-attention modules that generate "content" and "context" features. The context features of DeCLIP incorporate semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity cues from diffusion models, enhancing spatial consistency. Meanwhile, the content features are aligned with image crop representations and constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability. Through extensive experiments, DeCLIP has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various tasks such as 2D detection and segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D object pose estimation. The framework provides a solid foundation for open-vocabulary dense perception tasks, addressing limitations of existing models in aggregating information effectively from spatially or semantically related regions.

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel, the content features are aligned with image crop representations and constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D object pose estimation.} Code is available at https://github.com/xiaomoguhz/DeCLIP

Summary:
- The study investigates gender-linked associations in a vision-language model that aligns image and text representations.
- A dataset of face images and statements describing various occupations and activities is used to compute embeddings and association scores.
- Association scores measure the proximity of face embeddings to statements related to different gender stereotypes.
- Bootstrap confidence intervals and a label-swap null model are employed to assess the presence of gender biases in the model.
- The study provides a detailed analysis of gender associations across different categories and statements, along with a robust evaluation framework for gender bias in vision-language models. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation framework.

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly, Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework, PMTFR, for Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) tasks, addressing challenges in understanding reference images and textual instructions for target image retrieval. The framework incorporates the Pyramid Matching Model and a Training-Free Refinement module called Pyramid Patcher to enhance visual information understanding. By leveraging representation engineering inspired by Chain-of-Thought techniques, refined retrieval scores are obtained without explicit textual reasoning, improving performance in supervised CIR tasks. Extensive experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PMTFR over existing methods. The proposed framework does not require additional training of a ranking model and achieves state-of-the-art results in supervised CIR tasks. The code for PMTFR will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work, we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities. Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

Summary:  
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are typically used with language models to interpret hidden states, but their potential in the visual domain is not well-studied. This work extensively evaluates the effectiveness of SAEs in vision models across various tasks. The experimental results show that SAE features are meaningful semantically, enhance out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation in different vision model architectures. In vision embedding models, SAE features aid in out-of-distribution detection and capture the ontological structure. For diffusion models, SAEs enable semantic manipulation through text encoders and facilitate the discovery of human-interpretable attributes. Moreover, in multi-modal language models, SAE features uncover shared representations between vision and language modalities. Overall, this study underscores the potential of SAEs in enhancing interpretability, generalization, and steerability in visual tasks.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges, including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED, with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

<br>
Summary: <br>
The paper introduces TimeMachine, a diffusion-based framework for precise age editing in facial images while maintaining identity features. By incorporating high-precision age information into a multi-cross attention module, the model disentangles age-related and identity-related features for accurate age manipulation. The Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module predicts age directly in the latent space, enhancing editing accuracy without significant increase in training cost. Additionally, a new High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset (HFFA) is introduced to address the lack of large-scale facial age datasets. Experimental results show that TimeMachine achieves superior performance in fine-grained age editing while ensuring consistency in personal identity. <div>

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset (High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

<title>Hyperspectral vs. RGB for Pedestrian Segmentation in Urban Driving Scenes: A Comparative Study</title>

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM). Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25% F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical automotive applications.

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF) modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore, our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

<title>Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.

<title>Delving into Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency for Robust 3D Multi-Object Tracking</title>

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets, respectively.

<title>Noise Matters: Optimizing Matching Noise for Diffusion Classifiers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11330</link>

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising effects with different category conditions to classify categories. Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles, we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good) noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of NoOp.

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60% (2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias. Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent, scalable bias evaluation.

<title>Index-Aligned Query Distillation for Transformer-based Incremental Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task, Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell classification.

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability, reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs, further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art, segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets. Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification, domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code is available at: [link to be added after the paper is accepted]

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite {kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models for complex tubular structures.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices. Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions, Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy, thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations. Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information. Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution. This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including 3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input modalities.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric turbulence suppression tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels. Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training, introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly available at https: //github.com/Kainmueller-Lab/self_adapt.

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes, especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face, fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT, and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii) capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition. Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

<title>ImagiDrive: A Unified Imagination-and-Planning Framework for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at huggingface.co/datasets/simkoc/Remove360.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1) grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning, includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the correct next direction towards different specific target destinations. Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and code available along with visual demos on our project site

Abstract: With the rapid development of technology in the field of AI, deepfake technology has emerged as a double-edged sword. It has not only created a large amount of AI-generated content but also posed unprecedented challenges to digital security. The task of the competition is to determine whether a face image is a Deepfake image and output its probability score of being a Deepfake image. In the image track competition, our approach is based on the Swin Transformer V2-B classification network. And online data augmentation and offline sample generation methods are employed to enrich the diversity of training samples and increase the generalization ability of the model. Finally, we got the award of excellence in Deepfake image detection.

<title>CoFi: A Fast Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot Pipeline for Glomerular Basement Membrane Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning, which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at: https://github.com/ddrrnn123/CoFi.

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD) dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves 91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its progress.

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos, and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However, despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms, yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period. These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv) downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction, supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable, largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing baselines across all criteria.

Abstract: Detailed data is required to quantify energy conservation measures in buildings, such as envelop retrofits, without compromising cultural heritage. Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional inventories. In this study, the large language model GPT was used to detect various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this data and building register data as features, machine learning models were trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm, Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT, and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR performance for historical manuscripts.

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet, and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2) Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization. Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3% precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical engineering value.

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG) and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD) design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction capability and classification performance while reducing computational complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module, termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead. Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance. Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs, exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging analysis models.

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models (LVLMs) to encode object semantics into  tokens for mask prediction. However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding, yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &amp;F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &amp;F in ReasonVOS), while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model weights will be available at Veason-R1.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However, these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement (CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV.

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention, which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained 2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment, we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality, 3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.

<title>LoRAtorio: An intrinsic approach to LoRA Skill Composition</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario, which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening. We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment, abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%), calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0% malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with mammography VQA tasks.

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept, recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and computational operations via executable code. This approach not only facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping, rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations, all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy: an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation, followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20 benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains, particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Prevalent knee osteoarthritis (OA) imposes substantial burden on health systems with no cure available. Its ultimate treatment is total knee replacement (TKR). Complications from surgery and recovery are difficult to predict in advance, and numerous factors may affect them. Radiographic knee alignment is one of the key factors that impacts TKR outcomes, affecting outcomes such as postoperative pain or function. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced to the automatic analysis of knee radiographs, for example, to automate knee alignment measurements. Existing review articles tend to focus on knee OA diagnosis and segmentation of bones or cartilages in MRI rather than exploring knee alignment biomarkers for TKR outcomes and their assessment. In this review, we first examine the current scoring protocols for evaluating TKR outcomes and potential knee alignment biomarkers associated with these outcomes. We then discuss existing AI-based approaches for generating knee alignment biomarkers from knee radiographs, and explore future directions for knee alignment assessment and TKR outcome prediction.

<title>Failures to Surface Harmful Contents in Video Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are increasingly deployed on numerous critical applications, where users rely on auto-generated summaries while casually skimming the video stream. We show that this interaction hides a critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws: (1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3) encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain? Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&amp;C, which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The core of M&amp;C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&amp;C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines. Our results show that M&amp;C successfully predicts the best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model for the rest.

Abstract: Uterine fibroids (myomas) are the most common benign tumors of the female reproductive system, particularly among women of childbearing age. With a prevalence exceeding 70%, they pose a significant burden on female reproductive health. Clinical symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, pelvic pain, and pressure-related discomfort play a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions, which are largely influenced by the size, number, and anatomical location of the fibroids. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a precise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including measurements of volume, shape, and spatial location. However, this process is labor intensive and time consuming and subjected to variability due to intra- and inter-expert differences at both pre- and post-treatment stages. As a result, there is a critical need for an accurate and automated segmentation method for uterine fibroids. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have shown re-markable improvements in medical image segmentation, outperforming traditional methods. These approaches offer the potential for fully automated segmentation. Several studies have explored the use of deep learning models to achieve automated segmentation of uterine fibroids. However, most of the previous work has been conducted using private datasets, which poses challenges for validation and comparison between studies. In this study, we leverage the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset (UMD) to establish a baseline for automated segmentation of uterine fibroids, enabling standardized evaluation and facilitating future research in this domain.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that video generation models can enhance robot learning by deriving effective robot actions through inverse dynamics. However, these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate that GenFlowRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance across diverse and challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and temporally synchronized audio from video content is essential for video editing and post-production tasks, enabling the creation of semantically aligned audio for silent videos. However, most existing approaches focus on short-form audio generation for video segments under 10 seconds or rely on noisy datasets for long-form video-to-audio zsynthesis. To address these limitations, we introduce LD-LAudio-V1, an extension of state-of-the-art video-to-audio models and it incorporates dual lightweight adapters to enable long-form audio generation. In addition, we release a clean and human-annotated video-to-audio dataset that contains pure sound effects without noise or artifacts. Our method significantly reduces splicing artifacts and temporal inconsistencies while maintaining computational efficiency. Compared to direct fine-tuning with short training videos, LD-LAudio-V1 achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics: $FD_{\text{passt}}$ 450.00 $\rightarrow$ 327.29 (+27.27%), $FD_{\text{panns}}$ 34.88 $\rightarrow$ 22.68 (+34.98%), $FD_{\text{vgg}}$ 3.75 $\rightarrow$ 1.28 (+65.87%), $KL_{\text{panns}}$ 2.49 $\rightarrow$ 2.07 (+16.87%), $KL_{\text{passt}}$ 1.78 $\rightarrow$ 1.53 (+14.04%), $IS_{\text{panns}}$ 4.17 $\rightarrow$ 4.30 (+3.12%), $IB_{\text{score}}$ 0.25 $\rightarrow$ 0.28 (+12.00%), $Energy\Delta10\text{ms}$ 0.3013 $\rightarrow$ 0.1349 (+55.23%), $Energy\Delta10\text{ms(vs.GT)}$ 0.0531 $\rightarrow$ 0.0288 (+45.76%), and $Sem.\,Rel.$ 2.73 $\rightarrow$ 3.28 (+20.15%). Our dataset aims to facilitate further research in long-form video-to-audio generation and is available at https://github.com/deepreasonings/long-form-video2audio.

Abstract: Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.

Abstract: We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability.

<title>Efficient Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge for CT Field of View Extension</title>

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a cornerstone imaging modality for non-invasive, high-resolution visualization of internal anatomical structures. However, when the scanned object exceeds the scanner's field of view (FOV), projection data are truncated, resulting in incomplete reconstructions and pronounced artifacts near FOV boundaries. Conventional reconstruction algorithms struggle to recover accurate anatomy from such data, limiting clinical reliability. Deep learning approaches have been explored for FOV extension, with diffusion generative models representing the latest advances in image synthesis. Yet, conventional diffusion models are computationally demanding and slow at inference due to their iterative sampling process. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient CT FOV extension framework based on the image-to-image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) diffusion model. Unlike traditional diffusion models that synthesize images from pure Gaussian noise, I$^2$SB learns a direct stochastic mapping between paired limited-FOV and extended-FOV images. This direct correspondence yields a more interpretable and traceable generative process, enhancing anatomical consistency and structural fidelity in reconstructions. I$^2$SB achieves superior quantitative performance, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 49.8\,HU on simulated noisy data and 152.0HU on real data, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models such as conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (cDDPM) and patch-based diffusion methods. Moreover, its one-step inference enables reconstruction in just 0.19s per 2D slice, representing over a 700-fold speedup compared to cDDPM (135s) and surpassing diffusionGAN (0.58s), the second fastest. This combination of accuracy and efficiency makes I$^2$SB highly suitable for real-time or clinical deployment.

Abstract: Blood flow imaging provides important information for hemodynamic behavior within the vascular system and plays an essential role in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow images that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or device-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity field, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed noisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field from noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims to infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping that deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an alternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field and the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality reconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through experiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under varying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic geometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to assess the influence of key hyperparameters.

<title>Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware Spatiotemporal Fusion of Satellite Images</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework for satellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF). ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization function that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC, and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and outperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high performance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to enhance reproducibility and practical utility.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling, treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation for building robust spiking models.

Abstract: When humans perform everyday tasks, we naturally adjust our actions based on the current state of the environment. For instance, if we intend to put something into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However, many autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow pre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene, which can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and eventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and spatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving task success and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce a new Multi-Agent System (MAS) - Allen, designed to address two core challenges in current MAS design: (1) improve system's policy autonomy, empowering agents to dynamically adapt their behavioral strategies, and (2) achieving the trade-off between collaborative efficiency, task supervision, and human oversight in complex network topologies.
  Our core insight is to redefine the basic execution unit in the MAS, allowing agents to autonomously form different patterns by combining these units. We have constructed a four-tier state architecture (Task, Stage, Agent, Step) to constrain system behavior from both task-oriented and execution-oriented perspectives. This achieves a unification of topological optimization and controllable progress.
  Allen grants unprecedented Policy Autonomy, while making a trade-off for the controllability of the collaborative structure. The project code has been open source at: https://github.com/motern88/Allen

Abstract: Compression at low bitrates in modern codecs often introduces banding artifacts, especially in smooth regions such as skies. These artifacts degrade visual quality and are common in user-generated content due to repeated transcoding. We propose a banding restoration method that employs the Wavelet State Space Model and a frequency masking map to preserve high-frequency details. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark of open-source banding restoration methods and evaluate their performance on two public banding image datasets. Experimentation on the available datasets suggests that the proposed post-processing approach effectively suppresses banding compared to the state-of-the-art method (a DBI value of 0.082 on BAND-2k) while preserving image textures. Visual inspections of the results confirm this. Code and supplementary material are available at: https://github.com/xinyiW915/Debanding-PCS2025.

Abstract: Medical semantic-mask synthesis boosts data augmentation and analysis, yet most GAN-based approaches still produce one-to-one images and lack spatial consistency in complex scans. To address this, we propose AnatoMaskGAN, a novel synthesis framework that embeds slice-related spatial features to precisely aggregate inter-slice contextual dependencies, introduces diverse image-augmentation strategies, and optimizes deep feature learning to improve performance on complex medical images. Specifically, we design a GNN-based strongly correlated slice-feature fusion module to model spatial relationships between slices and integrate contextual information from neighboring slices, thereby capturing anatomical details more comprehensively; we introduce a three-dimensional spatial noise-injection strategy that weights and fuses spatial features with noise to enhance modeling of structural diversity; and we incorporate a grayscale-texture classifier to optimize grayscale distribution and texture representation during generation. Extensive experiments on the public L2R-OASIS and L2R-Abdomen CT datasets show that AnatoMaskGAN raises PSNR on L2R-OASIS to 26.50 dB (0.43 dB higher than the current state of the art) and achieves an SSIM of 0.8602 on L2R-Abdomen CT--a 0.48 percentage-point gain over the best model, demonstrating its superiority in reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality. Ablation studies that successively remove the slice-feature fusion module, spatial 3D noise-injection strategy, and grayscale-texture classifier reveal that each component contributes significantly to PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, further confirming the independent value of each core design in enhancing reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are more broadly applicable to different input types.

Abstract: The success of self-attention (SA) in Transformer demonstrates the importance of non-local information to image super-resolution (SR), but the huge computing power required makes it difficult to implement lightweight models. To solve this problem, we propose a pure convolutional neural network (CNN) model, LKFMixer, which utilizes large convolutional kernel to simulate the ability of self-attention to capture non-local features. Specifically, we increase the kernel size to 31 to obtain the larger receptive field as possible, and reduce the parameters and computations by coordinate decomposition. Meanwhile, a spatial feature modulation block (SFMB) is designed to enhance the focus of feature information on both spatial and channel dimension. In addition, by introducing feature selection block (FSB), the model can adaptively adjust the weights between local features and non-local features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LKFMixer family outperform other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of SR performance and reconstruction quality. In particular, compared with SwinIR-light on Manga109 dataset, LKFMixer-L achieves 0.6dB PSNR improvement at $\times$4 scale, while the inference speed is $\times$5 times faster. The code is available at https://github.com/Supereeeee/LKFMixer.

Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

Abstract: Subcortical segmentation in neuroimages plays an important role in understanding brain anatomy and facilitating computer-aided diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries and neurodegenerative disorders. However, training accurate automatic models requires large amounts of labelled data. Despite the availability of publicly available subcortical segmentation datasets for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a significant gap exists for Computed Tomography (CT). This paper proposes an automatic ensemble framework to generate high-quality subcortical segmentation labels for CT scans by leveraging existing MRI-based models. We introduce a robust ensembling pipeline to integrate them and apply it to unannotated paired MRI-CT data, resulting in a comprehensive CT subcortical segmentation dataset. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework. Furthermore, using our generated CT dataset, we train segmentation models that achieve improved performance on related segmentation tasks. To facilitate future research, we make our source code, generated dataset, and trained models publicly available at https://github.com/SCSE-Biomedical-Computing-Group/CT-Subcortical-Segmentation, marking the first open-source release for CT subcortical segmentation to the best of our knowledge.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at aligning generated images with textual prompts, controlling the visual style of the output remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose Style-Prompting Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation. SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple, robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Rumbling281441/SPG.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Deep Learning has emerged as a promising approach for skin lesion analysis. However, existing methods mostly rely on fully supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled data, which is challenging and costly to obtain. To alleviate this annotation burden, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised deep learning approach that integrates ensemble learning with online knowledge distillation for enhanced skin lesion classification. Our methodology involves training an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online knowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members. This process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble, thereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself. Post-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test time, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the ensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual model performs better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on both the \emph{International Skin Imaging Collaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing current state-of-the-art results. By leveraging ensemble learning and online knowledge distillation, our method reduces the need for extensive labeled data while providing a more resource-efficient solution for skin lesion classification in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.

Abstract: Predicting human scanpaths when exploring panoramic videos is a challenging task due to the spherical geometry and the multimodality of the input, and the inherent uncertainty and diversity of the output. Most previous methods fail to give a complete treatment of these characteristics, and thus are prone to errors. In this paper, we present a simple new criterion for scanpath prediction based on principles from lossy data compression. This criterion suggests minimizing the expected code length of quantized scanpaths in a training set, which corresponds to fitting a discrete conditional probability model via maximum likelihood. Specifically, the probability model is conditioned on two modalities: a viewport sequence as the deformation-reduced visual input and a set of relative historical scanpaths projected onto respective viewports as the aligned path input. The probability model is parameterized by a product of discretized Gaussian mixture models to capture the uncertainty and the diversity of scanpaths from different users. Most importantly, the training of the probability model does not rely on the specification of "ground-truth" scanpaths for imitation learning. We also introduce a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller-based sampler to generate realistic human-like scanpaths from the learned probability model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently produces better quantitative scanpath results in terms of prediction accuracy (by comparing to the assumed "ground-truths") and perceptual realism (through machine discrimination) over a wide range of prediction horizons. We additionally verify the perceptual realism improvement via a formal psychophysical experiment and the generalization improvement on several unseen panoramic video datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) focuses on identifying various attributes in pedestrian images, with key applications in person retrieval, suspect re-identification, and soft biometrics. However, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for PAR often suffer from over-parameterization and high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. Traditional tensor-based compression methods typically factorize layers without adequately preserving the gradient direction during compression, leading to inefficient compression and a significant accuracy loss. In this work, we propose a novel approach for determining the optimal ranks of low-rank layers, ensuring that the gradient direction of the compressed model closely aligns with that of the original model. This means that the compressed model effectively preserves the update direction of the full model, enabling more efficient compression for PAR tasks. The proposed procedure optimizes the compression ranks for each layer within the ALM model, followed by compression using CPD-EPC or truncated SVD. This results in a reduction in model complexity while maintaining high performance.

<title>Compositional Zero-shot Learning via Progressive Language-based Observations</title>

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by leveraging known primitives (state and object) during training. However, effectively modeling interactions between primitives and generalizing knowledge to novel compositions remains a perennial challenge. There are two key factors: object-conditioned and state-conditioned variance, i.e., the appearance of states (or objects) can vary significantly when combined with different objects (or states). For instance, the state "old" can signify a vintage design for a "car" or an advanced age for a "cat". In this paper, we argue that these variances can be mitigated by predicting composition categories based on pre-observed primitive. To this end, we propose Progressive Language-based Observations (PLO), which can dynamically determine a better observation order of primitives. These observations comprise a series of concepts or languages that allow the model to understand image content in a step-by-step manner. Specifically, PLO adopts pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to empower the model with observation capabilities. We further devise two variants: 1) PLO-VLM: a two-step method, where a pre-observing classifier dynamically determines the observation order of two primitives. 2) PLO-LLM: a multi-step scheme, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to craft composition-specific prompts for step-by-step observing. Extensive ablations on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of PLO compared with state-of-the-art methods, affirming its abilities in compositional recognition.

Abstract: Rendering the visual appearance of moving humans from occluded monocular videos is a challenging task. Most existing research renders 3D humans under ideal conditions, requiring a clear and unobstructed scene. Those methods cannot be used to render humans in real-world scenes where obstacles may block the camera's view and lead to partial occlusions. In this work, we present Wild2Avatar, a neural rendering approach catered for occluded in-the-wild monocular videos. We propose occlusion-aware scene parameterization for decoupling the scene into three parts - occlusion, human, and background. Additionally, extensive objective functions are designed to help enforce the decoupling of the human from both the occlusion and the background and to ensure the completeness of the human model. We verify the effectiveness of our approach with experiments on in-the-wild videos.

Abstract: Message hiding, a technique that conceals secret message bits within a cover image, aims to achieve an optimal balance among message capacity, recovery accuracy, and imperceptibility. While convolutional neural networks have notably improved message capacity and imperceptibility, achieving high recovery accuracy remains challenging. This challenge arises because convolutional operations struggle to preserve the sequential order of message bits and effectively address the discrepancy between these two modalities. To address this, we propose StegaFormer, an innovative MLP-based framework designed to preserve bit order and enable global fusion between modalities. Specifically, StegaFormer incorporates three crucial components: Order-Preserving Message Encoder (OPME), Decoder (OPMD) and Global Message-Image Fusion (GMIF). OPME and OPMD aim to preserve the order of message bits by segmenting the entire sequence into equal-length segments and incorporating sequential information during encoding and decoding. Meanwhile, GMIF employs a cross-modality fusion mechanism to effectively fuse the features from the two uncorrelated modalities. Experimental results on the COCO and DIV2K datasets demonstrate that StegaFormer surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of recovery accuracy, message capacity, and imperceptibility. We will make our code publicly available.

Abstract: Monitoring space objects is crucial for space situational awareness, yet reconstructing 3D satellite models from ground-based telescope images is challenging due to atmospheric turbulence, long observation distances, limited viewpoints, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a novel computational imaging framework that overcomes these obstacles by integrating a hybrid image pre-processing pipeline with a joint pose estimation and 3D reconstruction module based on controlled Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search. We validate our approach on both synthetic satellite datasets and on-sky observations of China's Tiangong Space Station and the International Space Station, achieving robust 3D reconstructions of low-Earth orbit satellites from ground-based data. Quantitative evaluations using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and Chamfer Distance demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches, and ablation studies confirm the critical role of each component. Our framework enables high-fidelity 3D satellite monitoring from Earth, offering a cost-effective alternative for space situational awareness.

Abstract: The significant advancements in embodied vision navigation have raised concerns about its susceptibility to adversarial attacks exploiting deep neural networks. Investigating the adversarial robustness of embodied vision navigation is crucial, especially given the threat of 3D physical attacks that could pose risks to human safety. However, existing attack methods for embodied vision navigation often lack physical feasibility due to challenges in transferring digital perturbations into the physical world. Moreover, current physical attacks for object detection struggle to achieve both multi-view effectiveness and visual naturalness in navigation scenarios. To address this, we propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching adversarial patches to objects, where both opacity and textures are learnable. Specifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a multi-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which optimizes the patch's texture based on feedback from the vision-based perception model used in navigation. To make the patch inconspicuous to human observers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, in which opacity is fine-tuned after texture optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our adversarial patches decrease the navigation success rate by an average of 22.39%, outperforming previous methods in practicality, effectiveness, and naturalness.

Abstract: Capturing long-range dependencies while preserving high-resolution visual representations is crucial for dense prediction tasks such as human pose estimation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced global modeling through self-attention but suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to token count, limiting their efficiency and scalability to high-resolution inputs, especially on mobile and resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, offer an efficient alternative by combining global receptive fields with linear computational complexity, enabling scalable and resource-friendly sequence modeling. However, when applied to dense prediction tasks, existing visual SSMs face key limitations: weak spatial inductive bias, long-range forgetting from hidden state decay, and low-resolution outputs that hinder fine-grained localization. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which augments visual state space models with multi-scale convolutional operations to enhance local spatial representations and strengthen spatial inductive biases. Through architectural exploration and theoretical analysis, we incorporate deformable operation into the DVSS block, identifying it as an efficient and effective mechanism to enhance semantic aggregation and mitigate long-range forgetting via input-dependent, adaptive spatial sampling. We embed DVSS into a multi-branch high-resolution architecture to build HRVMamba, a novel model for efficient high-resolution representation learning. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation show that HRVMamba performs competitively against leading CNN-, ViT-, and SSM-based baselines.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its efficient representation and rendering of 3D scenes using continuous Gaussian primitives. However, it struggles with sparse-view inputs due to limited geometric and photometric information, causing ambiguities in depth, shape, and texture.
  we propose GBR: Generative Bundle Refinement, a method for high-fidelity Gaussian splatting and meshing using only 4-6 input views. GBR integrates a neural bundle adjustment module to enhance geometry accuracy and a generative depth refinement module to improve geometry fidelity. More specifically, the neural bundle adjustment module integrates a foundation network to produce initial 3D point maps and point matches from unposed images, followed by bundle adjustment optimization to improve multiview consistency and point cloud accuracy. The generative depth refinement module employs a diffusion-based strategy to enhance geometric details and fidelity while preserving the scale. Finally, for Gaussian splatting optimization, we propose a multimodal loss function incorporating depth and normal consistency, geometric regularization, and pseudo-view supervision, providing robust guidance under sparse-view conditions. Experiments on widely used datasets show that GBR significantly outperforms existing methods under sparse-view inputs. Additionally, GBR demonstrates the ability to reconstruct and render large-scale real-world scenes, such as the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Great Wall, with remarkable details using only 6 views.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have improved visual tracking, but most still cannot run in real time on resource-limited devices, especially for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. To achieve a better balance between performance and efficiency, we propose AVTrack, an adaptive computation tracking framework that adaptively activates transformer blocks through an Activation Module (AM), which dynamically optimizes the ViT architecture by selectively engaging relevant components. To address extreme viewpoint variations, we propose to learn view-invariant representations via mutual information (MI) maximization. In addition, we propose AVTrack-MD, an enhanced tracker incorporating a novel MI maximization-based multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework. Leveraging multiple off-the-shelf AVTrack models as teachers, we maximize the MI between their aggregated softened features and the corresponding softened feature of the student model, improving the generalization and performance of the student, especially under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments show that AVTrack-MD achieves performance comparable to AVTrack's performance while reducing model complexity and boosting average tracking speed by over 17\%.

Abstract: Cybersickness remains a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of immersive virtual reality (VR), particularly in consumer-grade environments. While prior methods rely on invasive signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) for high predictive accuracy, these approaches require specialized hardware and are impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a scalable, deployable framework for personalized cybersickness prediction leveraging only non-invasive signals readily available from commercial VR headsets, including head motion, eye tracking, and physiological responses. Our model employs a modality-specific graph neural network enhanced with a Difference Attention Module to extract temporal-spatial embeddings capturing dynamic changes across modalities. A cross-modal alignment module jointly trains the video encoder to learn personalized traits by aligning video features with sensor-derived representations. Consequently, the model accurately predicts individual cybersickness using only video input during inference. Experimental results show our model achieves 88.4\% accuracy, closely matching EEG-based approaches (89.16\%), while reducing deployment complexity. With an average inference latency of 90ms, our framework supports real-time applications, ideal for integration into consumer-grade VR platforms without compromising personalization or performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized large-scale visual modeling, yet remain underexplored in face recognition (FR) where CNNs still dominate. We identify a critical bottleneck: CNN-inspired training paradigms fail to unlock ViT's potential, leading to suboptimal performance and convergence instability.To address this challenge, we propose LVFace, a ViT-based FR model that integrates Progressive Cluster Optimization (PCO) to achieve superior results. Specifically, PCO sequentially applies negative class sub-sampling (NCS) for robust and fast feature alignment from random initialization, feature expectation penalties for centroid stabilization, performing cluster boundary refinement through full-batch training without NCS constraints. LVFace establishes a new state-of-the-art face recognition baseline, surpassing leading approaches such as UniFace and TopoFR across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LVFace delivers consistent performance gains, while exhibiting scalability to large-scale datasets and compatibility with mainstream VLMs and LLMs. Notably, LVFace secured 1st place in the ICCV 2021 Masked Face Recognition (MFR)-Ongoing Challenge (March 2025), proving its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is included in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes in the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel framework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social biases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an LLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in generated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module that fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate identified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and datasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining high-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and quantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space, building upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our results show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the diversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate, using the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are challenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond occupation-related prompts. On the basis of these findings, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for evaluating bias in T2I models.

Abstract: Recently, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has demonstrated superior geometry reconstruction quality than the popular 3DGS by using 2D surfels to approximate thin surfaces. However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces, resulting in visible holes in these areas. We find that the reflection discontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specular reflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in the optimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depth distortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes a strong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectify the depth criterion in determining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersecting Gaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaoXinyyx/Unbiased_Surfel.

Abstract: Transparent objects are common in daily life, and understanding their multi-layer depth information -- perceiving both the transparent surface and the objects behind it -- is crucial for real-world applications that interact with transparent materials. In this paper, we introduce LayeredDepth, the first dataset with multi-layer depth annotations, including a real-world benchmark and a synthetic data generator, to support the task of multi-layer depth estimation. Our real-world benchmark consists of 1,500 images from diverse scenes, and evaluating state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on it reveals that they struggle with transparent objects. The synthetic data generator is fully procedural and capable of providing training data for this task with an unlimited variety of objects and scene compositions. Using this generator, we create a synthetic dataset with 15,300 images. Baseline models training solely on this synthetic dataset produce good cross-domain multi-layer depth estimation. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art single-layer depth models on it substantially improves their performance on transparent objects, with quadruplet accuracy on our benchmark increased from 55.14% to 75.20%. All images and validation annotations are available under CC0 at https://layereddepth.cs.princeton.edu.

Abstract: Recently, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for industrial inspection and medical diagnostics, detecting defects in novel objects without requiring any target-dataset samples during training. Existing CLIP-based ZSAD methods generate anomaly maps by measuring the cosine similarity between visual and textual features. However, CLIP's alignment with object categories instead of their anomalous states limits its effectiveness for anomaly detection. To address this limitation, we propose AFR-CLIP, a CLIP-based anomaly feature rectification framework. AFR-CLIP first performs image-guided textual rectification, embedding the implicit defect information from the image into a stateless prompt that describes the object category without indicating any anomalous state. The enriched textual embeddings are then compared with two pre-defined stateful (normal or abnormal) embeddings, and their text-on-text similarity yields the anomaly map that highlights defective regions. To further enhance perception to multi-scale features and complex anomalies, we introduce self prompting (SP) and multi-patch feature aggregation (MPFA) modules. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven anomaly detection benchmarks across industrial and medical domains, demonstrating AFR-CLIP's superiority in ZSAD.

Abstract: Medical report generation requires specialized expertise that general large models often fail to accurately capture. Moreover, the inherent repetition and similarity in medical data make it difficult for models to extract meaningful features, resulting in a tendency to overfit. So in this paper, we propose a multimodal model, Co-Attention Triple-LSTM Network (CA-TriNet), a deep learning model that combines transformer architectures with a Multi-LSTM network. Its Co-Attention module synergistically links a vision transformer with a text transformer to better differentiate medical images with similarities, augmented by an adaptive weight operator to catch and amplify image labels with minor similarities. Furthermore, its Triple-LSTM module refines generated sentences using targeted image objects. Extensive evaluations over three public datasets have demonstrated that CA-TriNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of comprehensive ability, even pre-trained large language models on some metrics.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image analysis, but extending them to 3D remains challenging due to the high computational demands of volumetric data and the difficulty of aligning 3D spatial features with clinical text. We present Med3DVLM, a 3D VLM designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) DCFormer, an efficient encoder that uses decomposed 3D convolutions to capture fine-grained spatial features at scale; (2) SigLIP, a contrastive learning strategy with pairwise sigmoid loss that improves image-text alignment without relying on large negative batches; and (3) a dual-stream MLP-Mixer projector that fuses low- and high-level image features with text embeddings for richer multi-modal representations. We evaluate our model on the M3D dataset, which includes radiology reports and VQA data for 120,084 3D medical images. Results show that Med3DVLM achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks. For image-text retrieval, it reaches 61.00% R@1 on 2,000 samples, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art M3D model (19.10%). For report generation, it achieves a METEOR score of 36.42% (vs. 14.38%). In open-ended visual question answering (VQA), it scores 36.76% METEOR (vs. 33.58%), and in closed-ended VQA, it achieves 79.95% accuracy (vs. 75.78%). These results highlight Med3DVLM's ability to bridge the gap between 3D imaging and language, enabling scalable, multi-task reasoning across clinical applications. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mirthAI/Med3DVLM.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of AI-generated images is essential for mitigating risks associated with AI misuse. However, the substantial domain gap among generative models makes it challenging to develop a generalizable forgery detection model. Moreover, since every pixel in an AI-generated image is synthesized, traditional saliency-based forgery explanation methods are not well suited for this task. To address these challenges, we formulate detection and explanation as a unified Forgery Detection and Reasoning task (FDR-Task), leveraging Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide accurate detection through reliable reasoning over forgery attributes. To facilitate this task, we introduce the Multi-Modal Forgery Reasoning dataset (MMFR-Dataset), a large-scale dataset containing 120K images across 10 generative models, with 378K reasoning annotations on forgery attributes, enabling comprehensive evaluation of the FDR-Task. Furthermore, we propose FakeReasoning, a forgery detection and reasoning framework with three key components: 1) a dual-branch visual encoder that integrates CLIP and DINO to capture both high-level semantics and low-level artifacts; 2) a Forgery-Aware Feature Fusion Module that leverages DINO's attention maps and cross-attention mechanisms to guide MLLMs toward forgery-related clues; 3) a Classification Probability Mapper that couples language modeling and forgery detection, enhancing overall performance. Experiments across multiple generative models demonstrate that FakeReasoning not only achieves robust generalization but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both detection and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has gained significant attention for its superior performance. However, most existing methods rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, limiting their ability to capture detailed scenes in high-contrast environments. While some prior works address high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, they typically require multi-view sharp images with varying exposure times captured at fixed camera positions, which is time-consuming and impractical. To make data acquisition more flexible, we propose \textbf{Casual3DHDR}, a robust one-stage method that reconstructs 3D HDR scenes from casually-captured auto-exposure (AE) videos, even under severe motion blur and unknown, varying exposure times. Our approach integrates a continuous camera trajectory into a unified physical imaging model, jointly optimizing exposure times, camera trajectory, and the camera response function (CRF). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \textbf{Casual3DHDR} outperforms existing methods in robustness and rendering quality. Our source code and dataset will be available at https://lingzhezhao.github.io/CasualHDRSplat/

Abstract: Interpreting object-referential language and grounding objects in 3D with spatial relations and attributes is essential for robots operating alongside humans. However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on two autonomous vehicles and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments. All source code for the system pipeline is publicly released at https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D.

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.

Abstract: Due to the domain gap between real-world and synthetic hazy images, current data-driven dehazing algorithms trained on synthetic datasets perform well on synthetic data but struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{I}mage \textbf{D}ehazing \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels (IDDM), a novel diffusion process that incorporates the atmospheric scattering model into noise diffusion. IDDM aims to use the gradual haze formation process to help the denoising Unet robustly learn the distribution of clear images from the conditional input hazy images. We design a specialized training strategy centered around IDDM. Diffusion models are leveraged to bridge the domain gap from synthetic to real-world, while the atmospheric scattering model provides physical guidance for haze formation. During the forward process, IDDM simultaneously introduces haze and noise into clear images, and then robustly separates them during the sampling process. By training with physics-guided information, IDDM shows the ability of domain generalization, and effectively restores the real-world hazy images despite being trained on synthetic datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the unique target described by natural languages in 3D scenes. The significant gap between 3D and language modalities makes it a notable challenge to distinguish multiple similar objects through the described spatial relationships. Current methods attempt to achieve cross-modal understanding in complex scenes via a target-centered learning mechanism, ignoring the modeling of referred objects. We propose a novel 3D visual grounding framework that constructs language-guided scene graphs with referred object discrimination to improve relational perception. The framework incorporates a dual-branch visual encoder that leverages pre-trained 2D semantics to enhance and supervise the multi-modal 3D encoding. Furthermore, we employ graph attention to promote relationship-oriented information fusion in cross-modal interaction. The learned object representations and scene graph structure enable effective alignment between 3D visual content and textual descriptions. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate our superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in handling the challenges of multiple similar distractors.

Abstract: Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.

Abstract: Recent advancements in prompt-based medical image segmentation have enabled clinicians to identify tumors using simple input like bounding boxes or text prompts. However, existing methods face challenges when doctors need to interact through natural language or when position reasoning is required - understanding spatial relationships between anatomical structures and pathologies. We present PRS-Med, a framework that integrates vision-language models with segmentation capabilities to generate both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. Additionally, we introduce the MMRS dataset (Multimodal Medical in Positional Reasoning Segmentation), which provides diverse, spatially-grounded question-answer pairs to address the lack of position reasoning data in medical imaging. PRS-Med demonstrates superior performance across six imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, endoscopy, RGB), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both segmentation accuracy and position reasoning. Our approach enables intuitive doctor-system interaction through natural language, facilitating more efficient diagnoses. Our dataset pipeline, model, and codebase will be released to foster further research in spatially-aware multimodal reasoning for medical applications.

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity, which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2) limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises 620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis, etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at https://github.com/ZMH-SDUST/PhysLab.

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a major source of injury in hospitals and long-term care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500 parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal computational and memory overhead.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods, whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2) a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data. Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and localization under domain shift.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing datasets. We present HateClipSeg, a large-scale multimodal dataset with both video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting, Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches. The HateClipSeg dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/HateClipSeg.git.

<title>Refine-IQA: Multi-Stage Reinforcement Finetuning for Perceptual Image Quality Assessment</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training. Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process, leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907 locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust "think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research. Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently, building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

<title>JMA: a General Algorithm to Craft Nearly Optimal Targeted Adversarial Example</title>

Abstract: Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.

Abstract: Current deep learning-based approaches to lesion segmentation in neuroimaging often depend on high-resolution images and extensive annotated data, limiting clinical applicability. This paper introduces a novel synthetic data framework tailored for stroke lesion segmentation, expanding the SynthSeg methodology to incorporate lesion-specific augmentations that simulate diverse pathological features. Using a modified nnUNet architecture, our approach trains models with label maps from healthy and stroke datasets, facilitating segmentation across both normal and pathological tissue without reliance on specific sequence-based training. Evaluation across in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) datasets reveals that our method matches state-of-the-art performance within the training domain and significantly outperforms existing methods on OOD data. By minimizing dependence on large annotated datasets and allowing for cross-sequence applicability, our framework holds potential to improve clinical neuroimaging workflows, particularly in stroke pathology. PyTorch training code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/SynthStroke, along with an SPM toolbox featuring a plug-and-play model at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/SynthStrokeSPM.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of brain tumors in intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) images could facilitate localization of tumor tissue during resection surgery. The lack of large annotated datasets limits the current models performances. In this paper, we investigated the use of tumor annotations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are more accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated MRI scans with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training the nnU-Net model with different configurations of the data and label origins. The results showed no significant difference in Dice score for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors compared to models trained with only iUS annotations and both, and to expert annotations, indicating that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for iUS tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in iUS images. The best model obtained an average Dice score of $0.62\pm0.31$, compared to $0.67\pm0.25$ for an expert neurosurgeon, where the performance on larger tumors were similar, but lower for the models on smaller tumors. In addition, the results showed that removing smaller tumors from the training sets improved the results.

<title>GDSR: Global-Detail Integration through Dual-Branch Network with Wavelet Losses for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose the Dual-Group Multi-Scale Wavelet Loss, a wavelet-domain constraint mechanism via dual-group subband strategy and cross-resolution frequency alignment for enhanced reconstruction fidelity in RSI-SR. Extensive experiments under two degradation methods on several benchmarks, including AID, UCMerced, and RSSRD-QH, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.09 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 3.2 times faster.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a paradigm that augments large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge to tackle knowledge-intensive question answering. While several benchmarks evaluate Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) under Multimodal RAG settings, they predominantly retrieve from textual corpora and do not explicitly assess how models exploit visual evidence during generation. Consequently, there still lacks benchmark that isolates and measures the contribution of retrieved images in RAG. We introduce Visual-RAG, a question-answering benchmark that targets visually grounded, knowledge-intensive questions. Unlike prior work, Visual-RAG requires text-to-image retrieval and the integration of retrieved clue images to extract visual evidence for answer generation. With Visual-RAG, we evaluate 5 open-source and 3 proprietary MLLMs, showcasing that images provide strong evidence in augmented generation. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle to efficiently extract and utilize visual knowledge. Our results highlight the need for improved visual retrieval, grounding, and attribution in multimodal RAG systems.

Abstract: We develop an analytical framework for understanding how the generated distribution evolves during diffusion model training. Leveraging a Gaussian-equivalence principle, we solve the full-batch gradient-flow dynamics of linear and convolutional denoisers and integrate the resulting probability-flow ODE, yielding analytic expressions for the generated distribution. The theory exposes a universal inverse-variance spectral law: the time for an eigen- or Fourier mode to match its target variance scales as $\tau\propto\lambda^{-1}$, so high-variance (coarse) structure is mastered orders of magnitude sooner than low-variance (fine) detail. Extending the analysis to deep linear networks and circulant full-width convolutions shows that weight sharing merely multiplies learning rates accelerating but not eliminating the bias whereas local convolution introduces a qualitatively different bias. Experiments on Gaussian and natural-image datasets confirm the spectral law persists in deep MLP-based UNet. Convolutional U-Nets, however, display rapid near-simultaneous emergence of many modes, implicating local convolution in reshaping learning dynamics. These results underscore how data covariance governs the order and speed with which diffusion models learn, and they call for deeper investigation of the unique inductive biases introduced by local convolution.

Abstract: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are prevalent in the elderly population, typically assessed on computed tomography (CT) scans by evaluating vertebral height loss. This assessment helps determine the fracture's impact on spinal stability and the need for surgical intervention. However, the absence of pre-fracture CT scans and standardized vertebral references leads to measurement errors and inter-observer variability, while irregular compression patterns further challenge the precise grading of fracture severity. While deep learning methods have shown promise in aiding OVCFs screening, they often lack interpretability and sufficient sensitivity, limiting their clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel vertebra synthesis-height loss quantification-OVCFs grading framework. Our proposed model, HealthiVert-GAN, utilizes a coarse-to-fine synthesis network designed to generate pseudo-healthy vertebral images that simulate the pre-fracture state of fractured vertebrae. This model integrates three auxiliary modules that leverage the morphology and height information of adjacent healthy vertebrae to ensure anatomical consistency. Additionally, we introduce the Relative Height Loss of Vertebrae (RHLV) as a quantification metric, which divides each vertebra into three sections to measure height loss between pre-fracture and post-fracture states, followed by fracture severity classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on both the Verse2019 dataset and in-house dataset, and it provides cross-sectional distribution maps of vertebral height loss. This practical tool enhances diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings and assisting in surgical decision-making.

Abstract: Cervical spondylosis, a complex and prevalent condition, demands precise and efficient diagnostic techniques for accurate assessment. While MRI offers detailed visualization of cervical spine anatomy, manual interpretation remains labor-intensive and prone to error. To address this, we developed an innovative AI-assisted Expert-based Diagnosis System that automates both segmentation and diagnosis of cervical spondylosis using MRI. Leveraging multi-center datasets of cervical MRI images from patients with cervical spondylosis, our system features a pathology-guided segmentation model capable of accurately segmenting key cervical anatomical structures. The segmentation is followed by an expert-based diagnostic framework that automates the calculation of critical clinical indicators. Our segmentation model achieved an impressive average Dice coefficient exceeding 0.90 across four cervical spinal anatomies and demonstrated enhanced accuracy in herniation areas. Diagnostic evaluation further showcased the system's precision, with the lowest mean average errors (MAE) for the C2-C7 Cobb angle and the Maximum Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC) coefficient. In addition, our method delivered high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in herniation localization, K-line status assessment, T2 hyperintensity detection, and Kang grading. Comparative analysis and external validation demonstrate that our system outperforms existing methods, establishing a new benchmark for segmentation and diagnostic tasks for cervical spondylosis.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) providing essential diagnostic information. However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

Abstract: We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of modality collapse, a recently observed empirical phenomenon wherein models trained for multimodal fusion tend to rely only on a subset of the modalities, ignoring the rest. We show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder, denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation, with applications in dealing with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks validate our theoretical claims. Project page: https://abhrac.github.io/mmcollapse/.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.

Abstract: In ReLU networks, gradients of output units can be seen as their input-level representations, as they correspond to the units' pullbacks through the active subnetwork. However, gradients of deeper models are notoriously misaligned, significantly contributing to their black-box nature. We claim that this is because active subnetworks are inherently noisy due to the ReLU hard-gating. To tackle that noise, we propose soft-gating in the backward pass only. The resulting input-level vector field (called ''excitation pullback'') exhibits remarkable perceptual alignment, revealing high-resolution input- and target-specific features that ''just make sense'', therefore establishing a compelling novel explanation method. Furthermore, we speculate that excitation pullbacks approximate (directionally) the gradients of a simpler model, linear in the network's path space, learned implicitly during optimization and largely determining the network's decision; thus arguing for the faithfulness of the produced explanations and their overall significance.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

<div> Keywords: lipreading, temporal convolutional networks, dense skip connections, multi-dilated convolutional network, receptive field<br />
Summary:<br />
The proposed TD3Net addresses limitations in traditional word-level lipreading approaches by combining dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions in the backend architecture. This results in a wide and dense receptive field without blind spots, allowing for better modeling of complex temporal representations. Experimental results on the LRW and LRW-1000 datasets show that TD3Net achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer parameters and lower floating-point operations. The method effectively utilizes diverse temporal features while maintaining temporal continuity, showcasing significant advantages in lipreading systems. The code for TD3Net is available on the GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field, thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However, their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features. Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures. Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting notable advantages in lipreading systems. The code is available at our GitHub repository (https://github.com/Leebh-kor/TD3Net).

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces SIFThinker, a spatially-aware framework for multimodal large language models that improves complex visual tasks by incorporating attention correction with spatial cues. SIFThinker mimics human visual perception and enables image region focusing through depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. The reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy is utilized to create interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, resulting in the SIF-50K dataset. Additionally, the GRPO-SIF training paradigm integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, enhancing the model's ability to correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Experimental results demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms existing methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception while maintaining strong overall performance. The code for SIFThinker is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: few-shot learning, food images, patch filtering, similarity matrix, classification benchmarks

Summary:
SPFF is introduced to address the challenges faced by few-shot learning models when dealing with food images, which are visually complex and variable. By filtering patch embeddings stochastically based on their similarity to the class representation, SPFF focuses on patches with prominent class-specific food features while filtering out non-relevant patches. The approach uses a similarity matrix to quantify the relationship between query and support images. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like Food-101, VireoFood-172, and UECFood-256 demonstrate that SPFF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method improves few-shot learning performance by effectively attending to important elements in food images during classification tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing SoA methods.

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection, but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers have developed an interpretable method for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using Large Vision-Language Models. This approach combines radical analysis and pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings in OBS. The progressive training strategy guides the model from radical recognition to pictographic analysis, improving reasoning from glyph to meaning. A Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism enhances zero-shot decipherment performance. The newly created Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset facilitates model training with annotated Chinese characters and OBS images. Experimental results show state-of-the-art accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. The model also provides logical analysis processes, potentially offering valuable insights for undeciphered OBS in archaeological research. The dataset and code are publicly available for further research in digital humanities and historical studies. <div>

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity, abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability, especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly, our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

A deep learning method was developed and validated for automatic fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans, achieving 99.5% accuracy. The method placed keypoints on 35,928 scans across five TBDXA imaging modes, revealing associations with health markers. SAM feature distributions from the automatic point placement corroborated existing evidence and generated new hypotheses on body composition's relationship to frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic health markers.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes, then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic health markers.

Summary:
In this paper, a new Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach is introduced for explicit and interpretable multimodal fusion learning. The proposed Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer enables the Normalizing Flow-based Model to capture essential features of each modality in multimodal data. Three new cross-attention mechanisms, Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA), are proposed to efficiently capture complex correlations in multimodal data. The Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow allows scalability to high-dimensional multimodal data. Experimental results on semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

<br />Summary: <br />The study evaluates the integration of real and synthetic images to improve disease classification using an EfficientNetV2-L model for watermelon diseases. The training dataset was divided into treatments with different ratios of real and synthetic images. Models trained with a combination of real and synthetic images showed high precision, recall, and F1-score, with a significant increase in weighted F1-score from 0.65 to 1.00. The results indicate that a hybrid approach combining both real and synthetic images is essential to enhance model performance and generalizability in crop disease classification. This suggests that while synthetic images have potential benefits, they cannot wholly replace real images and should be used together for optimal model accuracy. <div>

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection. However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon \textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1 real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall, this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced in niche, safety-critical domains like industrial spill detection, where real incident data is scarce due to privacy concerns and data sensitivity. To address this, a scalable framework using synthetic data generation is introduced, allowing for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and enhancing the performance of object detectors. The study demonstrates that VLMs generalize better to unseen spill scenarios compared to detectors without synthetic data. However, when the synthetic data is utilized, both VLMs and detectors show significant improvements, making their performance comparable. The results highlight the effectiveness of high-fidelity synthetic data in bridging the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of synthetic data generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for deploying vision systems in industrial settings with limited real data availability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data (SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective, scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of 3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions, while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and decoding time.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with 3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep learning-based crack detection. Project page: https://github.com/nantonzhang/Awesome-Crack-Detection

Summary: 
The article introduces Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method designed to address the issue of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by improving factual grounding through inter-region consistency modeling. MRFD utilizes cross-attention to identify salient regions in images, generates initial responses for each region, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) to guide a consistency-aware fusion of predictions. Region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning are used in this process. Experimental results across various LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that MRFD effectively reduces hallucinations and enhances response factuality without necessitating model updates. <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without requiring model updates.

<div> point-of-gaze estimation, appearance-based, calibration, head pose variations, MobilePoG <br />
<br />Summary: 
The study focuses on appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation, which currently requires person-specific calibration due to individual differences. However, calibrated PoG estimators are sensitive to head pose variations. A benchmark called MobilePoG was created to analyze the impact of calibration points diversity and head poses on estimation accuracy. The research found that introducing a wider range of head poses during calibration improves the estimator's pose variation handling. A dynamic calibration strategy was proposed, where users fixate on points while moving their phones, effectively reducing sensitivity to head pose variations. This user-friendly and efficient calibration process enhances the PoG estimator's performance. <div>

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies. Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our project page.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel method for high-fidelity image generation by addressing performance bottlenecks in existing text-driven methods. The proposed approach combines text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms to improve semantic alignment accuracy and structural consistency. By integrating a contrastive learning module and utilizing structural priors such as semantic layout maps, the method enhances the spatial-level structural modeling of generated images. The model optimizes contrastive loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss using a multi-objective supervision mechanism. Experimental results on the COCO-2014 dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM metrics. The approach bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity, producing semantically clear and structurally complete images efficiently. This work provides a promising direction for joint text-image modeling and image generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling. This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

Summary:
The article focuses on developing a new framework for accurately recognizing figure skating jumps from videos. The proposed framework incorporates the three-dimensional nature and procedural structure of jump actions. It introduces a novel pose representation learning approach, VIFSS, that combines contrastive learning and action classification. A specialized 3D pose dataset, FS-Jump3D, is created for view-invariant contrastive pre-training. A fine-grained annotation scheme is introduced to mark the "entry" and "landing" phases of jumps, facilitating the learning of procedural structure. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the framework, achieving over 92% F1@50 on element-level TAS. The study also demonstrates the practicality of view-invariant contrastive pre-training when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the potential application of the approach in real-world scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating: the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning. For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps. Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry (preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

<div> template matching, multimodal optical images, phase consistency, sub-pixel, PCWLAD<br />
Summary:
The article presents a novel phase consistency weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method to enhance the accuracy of matching multimodal optical images. By combining coarse matching using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD, the PCWLAD method mitigates the impact of nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences. The method involves calculating phase consistencies without a noise filter, applying radiometric and geometric transformation models, and utilizing mutual structure filtering to improve structural consistency. Evaluations on three types of image datasets demonstrated that PCWLAD surpassed existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR) and root mean square error (RMSE), achieving an average matching accuracy of approximately 0.4 pixels. The software and datasets for PCWLAD are publicly available for further research and development. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step, PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore, mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR) and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

<br />Summary: <br />InterSyn introduces a novel approach for motion synthesis, focusing on generating realistic interaction motions by combining solo and multi-person dynamics. The framework utilizes an interleaved learning strategy to capture dynamic interactions and coordination in real-world scenarios. It consists of two modules: the INS module models solo and interactive behaviors simultaneously, while the REC module refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronization among characters. Experimental results demonstrate that InterSyn generates motion sequences with improved alignment to text and increased diversity compared to existing methods. The framework sets a new benchmark for robust and natural motion synthesis. Additionally, the code will be open-sourced to encourage further research and development in the field. <div>

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately, InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural, dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios. Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis (INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters. Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote further research and development in this area.

Summary: 
Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation are crucial for AI security, particularly in autonomous driving applications. Conventional methods lack spatial localization of OoD objects, limiting their use in critical tasks. OoD segmentation, however, provides pixel-level localization, essential for precise control actions in autonomous driving scenarios. Current approaches include test-time segmentation, outlier exposure during training, reconstruction-based methods, and leveraging powerful models. This survey reviews recent advances in OoD segmentation for autonomous driving, highlighting challenges and future research directions. Test-time segmentation allows for real-time OoD detection, while outlier exposure improves supervised training. Reconstruction-based methods focus on reconstructing anomalous regions, and leveraging powerful models enhances segmentation accuracy. Promising research areas include improving model robustness and scalability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization, limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges, and discuss promising future research directions.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Summary: 
Vision-language instruction tuning aims to learn visual concepts and skills simultaneously.

A targeted data selection method is introduced to optimize benchmark performance by identifying and selecting instructions with matching concepts or skills. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate a performance improvement of +0.9% over existing baselines on average and +1.5% on skill-focused subsets. The results emphasize the necessity of balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge and visual skills in instruction selection. <div>

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+ benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method, showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and +1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type, progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure. However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis, this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits. We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal pathologists.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser, a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes, AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

<div> Keywords: multimodal vision-language models, contrast sensitivity function, behavioral psychophysics, band-pass filtered noise images, prompt phrasing

Summary:
The study focuses on assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) with human perception by estimating their contrast sensitivity function (CSF). A novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired method was introduced to prompt chat-based VLMs to judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency, closely resembling real psychophysical experiments. Using band-pass filtered noise images and various prompts, the responses of multiple model architectures were evaluated. Results showed that while some models approximated human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully replicated both. The study also highlighted the significant impact of prompt phrasing on model responses, indicating concerns about prompt stability. Overall, the findings provide a new framework for exploring visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal discrepancies between their visual representations and human perception.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses, raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between their visual representations and human perception.

<div> Image generation, intrinsic scene properties, spatial consistency, Latent Diffusion Models, denoising <br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a novel approach for image generation that incorporates intrinsic scene properties to improve spatial consistency and realism. By leveraging depth and segmentation maps to capture scene structure, the model co-generates images and intrinsics, leading to more accurate representations. Pre-trained estimators are used to extract intrinsic properties from large datasets, which are then aggregated into a latent variable via an autoencoder. The method builds upon Latent Diffusion Models to denoise both image and intrinsic domains while maintaining image quality and alignment with the base model. Experimental results demonstrate the correction of spatial inconsistencies and natural layout improvements in generated images. <div>
arXiv:2508.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

<div> Framework, augmentation, semantic segmentation, label noise, model performance

Summary:
NSegment+ is a novel augmentation framework designed to address subtle label imperfections in semantic segmentation tasks. The method decouples image and label transformations, applying controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving the original images. This approach helps models learn robust representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies, leading to improved performance. Experiments on various datasets show significant gains in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), with enhancements of up to +3.39 on PASCAL VOC. The method's effectiveness is further demonstrated when combined with other training tricks like CutMix and Label Smoothing. These results highlight the importance of addressing implicit label noise in real-world datasets to enhance model generalization capacity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit) label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present, such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework (PQ-DAF) for improving driver distraction detection. It addresses the few-shot learning challenge and domain shift issues by leveraging a vision-language model to filter and expand training data. The framework combines a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to capture driver pose features and a sample quality assessment module based on a vision-language model. This allows for the generation of diverse synthetic samples while ensuring their reliability through quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that PQ-DAF significantly enhances performance in few-shot driver distraction detection tasks, particularly in data-scarce conditions. The framework achieves notable improvements in model generalization, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing cross-domain robustness for driver distraction detection.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework (PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness. Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-Image, diffusion models, suppression, delta vector, selective suppression

Summary: 
Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have improved in generating images from textual prompts. Challenges still exist in suppressing content strongly associated with specific words, such as a mustache appearing when generating an image of Charlie Chaplin. A novel approach is proposed to suppress entangled content within the text embedding space of diffusion models using a delta vector. This vector weakens the influence of undesired content, obtainable through a zero-shot approach. The Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method integrates the delta vector into the cross-attention mechanism for more effective content suppression. Personalized T2I models benefit from optimized delta vectors for precise suppression. Extensive experiments show the approach outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with ``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image, and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Summary:
SC-Lane is introduced as a novel framework for 3D lane detection, incorporating slope-aware and temporally consistent techniques. It utilizes a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module to dynamically predict weights for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap. The framework also includes a Height Consistency Module to ensure stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames. Evaluations using standardized metrics like MAE and RMSE on a LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset show the effectiveness of SC-Lane in improving height estimation and 3D lane detection. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with an F-score of 64.3% on the OpenLane benchmark, outperforming existing methods. Detailed results and a demonstration video can be found on the project page . 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap. Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work [20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

Summary:
Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl) is proposed for controllable text-to-image generation, using Flux as the backbone network. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal increase in parameters and computational costs. Rather than duplicating the backbone for control, a LoRA-style control module directly learns control signals from conditioning inputs. The KV-Context Augmentation mechanism integrates condition-specific key-value information into the backbone for effective feature fusion. Benchmark experiments show NanoControl reduces computational overhead while maintaining high generation quality and improved controllability compared to traditional methods. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically, rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style (low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality and achieving improved controllability.

Summary: 
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been utilized in autonomous driving scenarios, but they lack the spatiotemporal reasoning needed for dynamic traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, this study introduces STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering dataset based on ego-centric driving data in Tokyo. This dataset contains 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames, providing annotations like 3D bounding boxes and segmentation masks for object-centric and ego-centric reasoning. Existing VLMs struggle with spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, but fine-tuning them on STRIDE-QA leads to significant performance improvements, with 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction. This dataset lays the groundwork for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Summary:
CRISP, a novel approach for continual video instance segmentation, tackles instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion by introducing Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting. For instance-wise learning, CRISP emphasizes correlation with prior queries and strengthens specificity for current tasks. Category-wise learning is addressed through an Adaptive Residual Semantic Prompt (ARSP) framework, maintaining semantic coherence during incremental training. Task-wise learning focuses on inter-task correlation within the query space. Extensive experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets show CRISP outperforms existing methods in long-term video instance segmentation, improving segmentation and classification performance while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. For those interested, the code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning, we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt. Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification performance.

arXiv:2508.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality, simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision. To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST) that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training. Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone. Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans (DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with 2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection, classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the built environment.

<div> Keywords: human visual perception, bio-inspired architecture, image reconstruction, neural representations, perceptual metrics

Summary:
The study explores the relationship between human visual perception and image statistics, suggesting that the visual system may have evolved to efficiently process visual information based on certain image characteristics. The PerceptNet, a bio-inspired architecture, was developed and optimized for tasks such as autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Surprisingly, the encoder stage of the PerceptNet, resembling the V1 cortex, exhibited high correlation with human perceptual judgments on image distortion without explicitly utilizing perceptual information during training. The results indicate that the visual system may be finely tuned to address specific levels of noise, blur, and sparsity. The study also demonstrates that biologically inspired models can learn perceptual metrics autonomously, without requiring human supervision. This suggests a potential link between image statistics, neural representations, and human visual perception in early vision processing. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn perceptual metrics without human supervision.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Online video super-resolution (VSR) is crucial for video processing, with existing methods limited in long-range temporal modeling. A new method, TS-Mamba, combines trajectory-aware modeling and low-complexity Mamba for efficient spatio-temporal aggregation. It uses trajectories to select similar tokens from previous frames and employs Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation for token aggregation. Shifted SSMs blocks, based on Hilbert scanning and shift operations, enhance spatial continuity. A trajectory-aware loss function supervises trajectory generation. TS-Mamba outperforms benchmark models in VSR on three datasets, with a 22.7% reduction in complexity. The code will be available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will be available at https://github.com.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data. However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset. We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

<div> Keywords: STAS, lung adenocarcinoma, deep learning, histopathological images, multi-pattern attention-aware multiple instance learning

Summary:
STAS, a novel invasive pattern in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), is associated with recurrence and diminished survival rates. Large-scale diagnosis of STAS in LUAD is labor-intensive and prone to oversight. This study proposes a deep learning model, STAMP, for STAS diagnosis using histopathological images from multiple centers. The model features a dual-branch architecture, transformer-based instance encoding, and multi-pattern attention aggregation to enhance diagnostic accuracy. A similarity regularization constraint prevents feature redundancy and improves overall performance. STAMP achieved competitive results on STAS datasets from different hospitals, surpassing clinical standards with AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928. This research addresses the clinical need for efficient STAS diagnosis in LUAD using advanced deep learning techniques. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features. Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images. Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces. Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology, suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

<div> Keywords: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, image editing, TweezeEdit, semantic preservation, real-time applications

Summary:
TweezeEdit introduces a novel framework for image editing that improves semantic preservation and efficiency compared to existing methods. It avoids reliance on inversion anchors and instead regularizes the entire denoising path to retain source image semantics while efficiently incorporating target prompt semantics. By utilizing gradient-driven regularization and a consistency model, TweezeEdit achieves superior performance in preserving image semantics and aligning with target prompts. The method requires only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), making it suitable for real-time applications. TweezeEdit's direct path approach shortens editing paths and ensures consistent and efficient image editing. Overall, TweezeEdit outperforms existing methods in both semantic preservation and target alignment, offering a promising solution for high-quality and real-time image editing tasks.

arXiv:2508.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors, ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines. However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset. First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed method.

Summary:
Estimating human dance motion from both egocentric video and music is a challenging task with significant industrial implications. Existing methods either utilize egocentric video or music separately, but jointly estimating motion from both sources is underexplored. The authors present a novel approach using the EgoAIST++ dataset, comprising egocentric views and music for over 36 hours of dance motion data. Their EgoMusic Motion Network, including a Skeleton Mamba model, effectively captures the human body's skeleton structure.

The fusion of egocentric video and music in predicting human dance motion opens new possibilities for improving the accuracy and realism of motion estimation algorithms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion. Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes effectively to real-world data.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning, existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity, and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability, reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent, trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces the concept of medical image grounding, aligning natural language phrases with regions in medical images for diagnostic purposes. The existing research limitations, such as modality coverage and annotation granularity, are addressed through the creation of Med-GLIP-5M dataset. This dataset consists of over 5.3 million region-level annotations across seven imaging modalities, supporting segmentation and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels. The Med-GLIP framework is proposed, which learns hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse data to recognize multi-granularity structures. Extensive experiments show that Med-GLIP outperforms existing baselines in grounding benchmarks and enhances performance in medical VQA and report generation tasks by integrating spatial outputs. The dataset will be made available soon for further research. <div>

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation (MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage, coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data -- enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks, including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on improving salient object detection in optical remote sensing images using a novel graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet). The network incorporates a visual state space (VSS) encoder for extracting multi-scale features and a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM) to enhance cross-layer interactions and structural perception. Additionally, the model features a LEVSS block decoder with an adaptive scanning strategy and a multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM) for capturing rich local region information. Experimental results show that the proposed GCRPNet outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in salient object detection tasks. The study demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model in handling challenges such as scale variations and low target-background contrast in optical remote sensing images. <div>
arXiv:2508.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.

Textual guidance is utilized to decouple and align disease-wise features from the two streams using feature distillation for improved domain generalization. Pseudo label consistency is employed to tackle the label absent issue, and self-distillation transfers task-relevant semantics between streams for enhanced detection performances. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in detecting six retinal diseases and normal states, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. The code for PSScreen is available on GitHub for further research and development.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization, where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision. System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload. Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations.

<title>Retrieval-Augmented Prompt for OOD Detection</title>

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

<title>PTQAT: A Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Quantization Algorithm for 3D Perception Tasks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10557</link>

arXiv:2508.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks. To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers. Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies, actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy. This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer weights.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads. HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However, vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images. We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets, Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at: https://github.com/humza909/SAM-CEM-CD

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues. Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation, achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

arXiv:2508.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks. Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results. Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

<title>Towards Powerful and Practical Patch Attacks for 2D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>

arXiv:2508.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric, Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets, both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous mAP-based metrics.

arXiv:2508.10616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to traditional upsampling methods.

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities. Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural preservation and improved clinical applicability.

<title>Increasing the Utility of Synthetic Images through Chamfer Guidance</title>

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2 exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%, respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\% reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling time.

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across 62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g., temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1 0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

arXiv:2508.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively, distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these acquisition-based or processing-based labels.

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks. Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets. Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back) were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect lameness with as little as one second of video data.

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot learning.

<title>Serial Over Parallel: Learning Continual Unification for Multi-Modal Visual Object Tracking and Benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks, causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data, reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by 27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format, progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity. Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification. We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset, we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face, which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition, and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales.

<title>HyperTea: A Hypergraph-based Temporal Enhancement and Alignment Network for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10678</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection (MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules: the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD, significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are available at https://github.com/Lurenjia-LRJ/HyperTea.

<title>Physics-Informed Joint Multi-TE Super-Resolution with Implicit Neural Representation for Robust Fetal T2 Mapping</title>

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently, T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time (TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

<title>IADGPT: Unified LVLM for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection, Localization, and Reasoning via In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across 400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in camera-ready.

<title>Novel View Synthesis using DDIM Inversion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive. Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization. This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

<title>Beyond conventional vision: RGB-event fusion for robust object detection in dynamic traffic scenarios</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10704</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection. To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network (MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

<title>CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

arXiv:2508.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at: https://github.com/JoohyeonL22/CountCluster .

Abstract: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward with NextStep-1, a 14B autoregressive model paired with a 157M flow matching head, training on discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens with next-token prediction objectives. NextStep-1 achieves state-of-the-art performance for autoregressive models in text-to-image generation tasks, exhibiting strong capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. Furthermore, our method shows strong performance in image editing, highlighting the power and versatility of our unified approach. To facilitate open research, we will release our code and models to the community.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory, processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target classification is possible.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones. Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection, and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC. To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality, setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

<title>Exploiting Discriminative Codebook Prior for Autoregressive Image Generation</title>

arXiv:2508.10719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook, which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance. Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering (EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports, and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips, spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs, whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models. Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be released at: \href{https://github.com/MyUniverse0726/EgoCross}{https://github.com/MyUniverse0726/EgoCross.}

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD, which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing, where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images. The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets. The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs, including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images, collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track. Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code and data for the competition is available at: https://github.com/dariant/SSBC_2025.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches.

<title>Forgery Guided Learning Strategy with Dual Perception Network for Deepfake Cross-domain Detection</title>

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection.

<title>An Efficient Model-Driven Groupwise Approach for Atlas Construction</title>

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large 3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas construction and applications.

<title>From Diagnosis to Improvement: Probing Spatio-Physical Reasoning in Vision Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10770</link>

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity, failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse, state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion, CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/Clarifiedfish/AEGIS.

<title>Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

<title>Ultra-High-Definition Reference-Based Landmark Image Super-Resolution with Generative Diffusion Prior</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10779</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10779</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image. Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera. This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis, represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks (including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

<title>VasoMIM: Vascular Anatomy-Aware Masked Image Modeling for Vessel Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10794</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations. Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components: anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically, VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

<title>Object Fidelity Diffusion for Remote Sensing Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10801</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase. Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Abstract: Plant diseases are a major threat to food security globally. It is important to develop early detection systems which can accurately detect. The advancement in computer vision techniques has the potential to solve this challenge. We have developed a mobile-friendly solution which can accurately classify 101 plant diseases across 33 crops. We built a comprehensive dataset by combining different datasets, Plant Doc, PlantVillage, and PlantWild, all of which are for the same purpose. We evaluated performance across several lightweight architectures - MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, MobileNetV3-Large, and EfficientNet-B0, B1 - specifically chosen for their efficiency on resource-constrained devices. The results were promising, with EfficientNet-B1 delivering our best performance at 94.7% classification accuracy. This architecture struck an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-world deployment on mobile devices.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% / 50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e., Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9% success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment \& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the community.

<title>Self-Supervised Stereo Matching with Multi-Baseline Contrastive Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views. Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions. The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and 2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

arXiv:2508.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving, collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed, introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based federated systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video generation paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering (VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%), and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks, but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

We also provide detailed model annotations describing overall characteristics, structural components, and intricate features. TexVerse offers a high-quality data resource with wide-ranging potential applications in texture synthesis, PBR material development, animation, and various 3D vision and graphics tasks.

<title>ToonComposer: Streamlining Cartoon Production with Generative Post-Keyframing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening, and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage. ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios. To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

arXiv:2508.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks. Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D understanding in streaming environments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at https://github.com/ignf/maestro.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning (VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

<title>Human-in-Context: Unified Cross-Domain 3D Human Motion Modeling via In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model. While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets. Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies. Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains. These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability. The source codes and models are available at https://github.com/BradleyWang0416/Human-in-Context.

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally, we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in existing methods.

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties, training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz. Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation, highlighting its practical potential.

<title>Invisible Watermarks, Visible Gains: Steering Machine Unlearning with Bi-Level Watermarking Design</title>

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML) models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO) framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability over existing VLMs.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes), we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152 achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast, accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical care and training.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings" that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney, 90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities, including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform. This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches, striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at https://github.com/ZhaomingKong/Haar-tSVD.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However, our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm. Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of precise manipulation and generalization.

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set, uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2% and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and long instruction following.

It is a curated approximately 10% open subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of creation). The corpus was collected over six weeks from over 87,000 contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT 5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial access with revenue sharing to contributors.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper, we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math 2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions, sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods, such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an ``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design choices, datasets, and ablations.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii) an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

<title>DIVA-VQA: Detecting Inter-frame Variations in UGC Video Quality</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment (VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames, fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations. Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation (DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/xinyiW915/DIVA-VQA.

<title>Geospatial Diffusion for Land Cover Imperviousness Change Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq 0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns from historical data that are significant for projecting future change. Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers. Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent. A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli. Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos; the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed 4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods rely heavily on photometric and geometric consistency constraints, but newer machine learning-based MVS methods check geometric consistency across multiple source views only as a post-processing step. In this paper, we present a novel approach that explicitly encourages geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views at different scales during learning (see Fig. 1). We find that adding this geometric consistency loss significantly accelerates learning by explicitly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, reducing the training iteration requirements to nearly half that of other MVS methods. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets, and competitive results on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, GC-MVSNet is the first attempt to enforce multi-view, multi-scale geometric consistency during learning.

Abstract: This study presents an automated lameness detection system that uses deep-learning image processing techniques to extract multiple locomotion traits associated with lameness. Using the T-LEAP pose estimation model, the motion of nine keypoints was extracted from videos of walking cows. The videos were recorded outdoors, with varying illumination conditions, and T-LEAP extracted 99.6% of correct keypoints. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used to compute six locomotion traits: back posture measurement, head bobbing, tracking distance, stride length, stance duration, and swing duration. The three most important traits were back posture measurement, head bobbing, and tracking distance. For the ground truth, we showed that a thoughtful merging of the scores of the observers could improve intra-observer reliability and agreement. We showed that including multiple locomotion traits improves the classification accuracy from 76.6% with only one trait to 79.9% with the three most important traits and to 80.1% with all six locomotion traits.

<title>Debiasing Multimodal Large Language Models via Penalization of Language Priors</title>

Abstract: In the realms of computer vision and natural language processing, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become indispensable tools, proficient in generating textual responses based on visual inputs. Despite their advancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias: the generated content is often driven more by the inherent priors of the underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) than by the input image. Empirical experiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as MLLMs often provide confident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent visual inputs. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward visual information, we propose two simple, training-free strategies. First, for tasks such as classification or multi-choice question answering, we introduce a "Post-Hoc Debias" method using an affine calibration step to adjust the output distribution. This approach ensures uniform answer scores when the image is absent, acting as an effective regularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more intricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to "Visual Debias Decoding", which mitigates bias by contrasting token log-probabilities conditioned on a correct image versus a meaningless one. Additionally, our investigation sheds light on the instability of MLLMs across various decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different settings, we achieve significant performance improvements--surpassing previously reported results--and raise concerns about the fairness of current evaluation practices. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in mitigating biases. These strategies not only prove beneficial in minimizing hallucinations but also contribute to the generation of more helpful and precise illustrations.

<title>VPOcc: Exploiting Vanishing Point for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes semantically and spatially is crucial for the safe navigation of robots and autonomous vehicles, aiding obstacle avoidance and accurate trajectory planning. Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which infers complete voxel grids from 2D images, is gaining importance in robot vision for its resource efficiency compared to 3D sensors. However, this task inherently suffers from a 2D-3D discrepancy, where objects of the same size in 3D space appear at different scales in a 2D image depending on their distance from the camera due to perspective projection. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework called VPOcc that leverages a vanishing point (VP) to mitigate the 2D-3D discrepancy at both the pixel and feature levels. As a pixel-level solution, we introduce a VPZoomer module, which warps images by counteracting the perspective effect using a VP-based homography transformation. In addition, as a feature-level solution, we propose a VP-guided cross-attention (VPCA) module that performs perspective-aware feature aggregation, utilizing 2D image features that are more suitable for 3D space. Lastly, we integrate two feature volumes extracted from the original and warped images to compensate for each other through a spatial volume fusion (SVF) module. By effectively incorporating VP into the network, our framework achieves improvements in both IoU and mIoU metrics on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 datasets. Additional details are available at https://vision3d-lab.github.io/vpocc/.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visuals from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, introduced as Recon3DMind, is of significant interest to both cognitive neuroscience and computer vision. To advance this task, we present the fMRI-3D dataset, which includes data from 15 participants and showcases a total of 4,768 3D objects. The dataset consists of two components: fMRI-Shape, previously introduced and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Shape, and fMRI-Objaverse, proposed in this paper and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Objaverse. fMRI-Objaverse includes data from 5 subjects, 4 of whom are also part of the core set in fMRI-Shape. Each subject views 3,142 3D objects across 117 categories, all accompanied by text captions. This significantly enhances the diversity and potential applications of the dataset. Moreover, we propose MinD-3D++, a novel framework for decoding textured 3D visual information from fMRI signals. The framework evaluates the feasibility of not only reconstructing 3D objects from the human mind but also generating, for the first time, 3D textured meshes with detailed textures from fMRI data. We establish new benchmarks by designing metrics at the semantic, structural, and textured levels to evaluate model performance. Furthermore, we assess the model's effectiveness in out-of-distribution settings and analyze the attribution of the proposed 3D pari fMRI dataset in visual regions of interest (ROIs) in fMRI signals. Our experiments demonstrate that MinD-3D++ not only reconstructs 3D objects with high semantic and spatial accuracy but also provides deeper insights into how the human brain processes 3D visual information.

Abstract: Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) has traditionally relied on support images with annotated keypoints, a process that is often cumbersome and may fail to fully capture the necessary correspondences across diverse object categories. Recent efforts have explored the use of text queries, leveraging their enhanced stability and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches often remain constrained by their reliance on support queries, their failure to fully utilize the rich priors embedded in pre-trained large language models, and the limitations imposed by their parametric distribution assumptions. To address these challenges, we introduce CapeLLM, the first multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for CAPE. Our method only employs query image and detailed text descriptions as an input to estimate category-agnostic keypoints. Our method encompasses effective training strategies and carefully designed instructions for applying the MLLM to CAPE. Moreover, we propose an inference mechanism that further enhances the reasoning process for unseen keypoints. while flexibly modeling their underlying spatial distribution and uncertainty, allowing for adaptive refinement based on contextual cues. We conducted extensive experiments to apply the MLLM to CAPE effectively, focusing not only on the model architecture and prompt design but also on ensuring robustness across input variations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the MP-100 benchmark in the 1-shot and even 5-shot setting, marking a significant advancement in the field of category-agnostic pose estimation. Code is available at https://github.com/Junhojuno/CapeLLM.

Abstract: Vision-brain understanding aims to extract semantic information about brain signals from human perceptions. Existing deep learning methods for vision-brain understanding are usually introduced in a traditional learning paradigm missing the ability to learn the connectivities between brain regions. Meanwhile, the quantum computing theory offers a new paradigm for designing deep learning models. Motivated by the connectivities in the brain signals and the entanglement properties in quantum computing, we propose a novel Quantum-Brain approach, a quantum-inspired neural network, to tackle the vision-brain understanding problem. To compute the connectivity between areas in brain signals, we introduce a new Quantum-Inspired Voxel-Controlling module to learn the impact of a brain voxel on others represented in the Hilbert space. To effectively learn connectivity, a novel Phase-Shifting module is presented to calibrate the value of the brain signals. Finally, we introduce a new Measurement-like Projection module to present the connectivity information from the Hilbert space into the feature space. The proposed approach can learn to find the connectivities between fMRI voxels and enhance the semantic information obtained from human perceptions. Our experimental results on the Natural Scene Dataset benchmarks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Top-1 accuracies of 95.1% and 95.6% on image and brain retrieval tasks and an Inception score of 95.3% on fMRI-to-image reconstruction task. Our proposed quantum-inspired network brings a potential paradigm to solving the vision-brain problems via the quantum computing theory.

Abstract: Facial aging is a complex process, highly dependent on multiple factors like gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, etc., making it extremely challenging to learn a global aging prior to predict aging for any individual accurately. Existing techniques often produce realistic and plausible aging results, but the re-aged images often do not resemble the person's appearance at the target age and thus need personalization. In many practical applications of virtual aging, e.g. VFX in movies and TV shows, access to a personal photo collection of the user depicting aging in a small time interval (20$\sim$40 years) is often available. However, naive attempts to personalize global aging techniques on personal photo collections often fail. Thus, we propose MyTimeMachine (MyTM), which combines a global aging prior with a personal photo collection (using as few as 50 images) to learn a personalized age transformation. We introduce a novel Adapter Network that combines personalized aging features with global aging features and generates a re-aged image with StyleGAN2. We also introduce three loss functions to personalize the Adapter Network with personalized aging loss, extrapolation regularization, and adaptive w-norm regularization. Our approach can also be extended to videos, achieving high-quality, identity-preserving, and temporally consistent aging effects that resemble actual appearances at target ages, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) is a recent 3D scene reconstruction technique that enables real-time rendering of novel views by modeling scenes as parametric point clouds of differentiable 3D Gaussians. However, its rendering speed and model size still present bottlenecks, especially in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we identify and address two key inefficiencies in 3D-GS to substantially improve rendering speed. These improvements also yield the ancillary benefits of reduced model size and training time. First, we optimize the rendering pipeline to precisely localize Gaussians in the scene, boosting rendering speed without altering visual fidelity. Second, we introduce a novel pruning technique and integrate it into the training pipeline, significantly reducing model size and training time while further raising rendering speed. Our Speedy-Splat approach combines these techniques to accelerate average rendering speed by a drastic $\mathit{6.71\times}$ across scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generation techniques, current methods often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, commonly referred to as the Janus Problem. This paper identifies the root cause of the Janus Problem: viewpoint generation bias in diffusion models, which creates a significant gap between the actual generated viewpoint and the expected one required for optimizing the 3D model. To address this issue, we propose a tuning-free approach called the Attention and CLIP Guidance (ACG) mechanism. ACG enhances desired viewpoints by adaptively controlling cross-attention maps, employs CLIP-based view-text similarities to filter out erroneous viewpoints, and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with staged prompts to progressively refine 3D generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the Janus Problem without compromising generation speed, establishing ACG as an efficient, plug-and-play component for existing text-to-3D frameworks.

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular video is essential for real-world applications. We introduce DGNS, a hybrid framework integrating \underline{D}eformable \underline{G}aussian Splatting and Dynamic \underline{N}eural \underline{S}urfaces, effectively addressing dynamic novel-view synthesis and 3D geometry reconstruction simultaneously. During training, depth maps generated by the deformable Gaussian splatting module guide the ray sampling for faster processing and provide depth supervision within the dynamic neural surface module to improve geometry reconstruction. Conversely, the dynamic neural surface directs the distribution of Gaussian primitives around the surface, enhancing rendering quality. In addition, we propose a depth-filtering approach to further refine depth supervision. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that DGNS achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, along with competitive results in novel-view synthesis.

Abstract: The choice of data representation is a key factor in the success of deep learning in geometric tasks. For instance, DUSt3R recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction and showing that all key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes can be reduced to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem: the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image-one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object and the other to a canonical version of the object in its rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction to recover the complete shape of the object, even through self-occlusions. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation can be reduced to the prediction of DualPMs. Empirically, we demonstrate that this representation is a suitable target for deep networks to predict. Specifically, we focus on modeling quadrupeds, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on synthetic 3D data, consisting of one or two models per category, while generalizing effectively to real images. With this approach, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of such objects.

Abstract: Instruction tuning fine-tunes pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to handle real-world tasks. However, the rapid expansion of visual instruction datasets introduces data redundancy, leading to excessive computational costs. We propose a collaborative framework, DataTailor, which leverages three key principles--informativeness, uniqueness, and representativeness--for effective data selection. We argue that a valuable sample should be informative of the task, non-redundant, and represent the sample distribution (i.e., not an outlier). We further propose practical ways to score against each principle, which automatically adapts to a given dataset without tedious hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DataTailor achieves 101.3% of the performance of full-data fine-tuning with only 15% of the data, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining superior results. This exemplifies the "Less is More" philosophy in MLLM development. The code and data is available in this \href{https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/DataTailor}{URL}.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying deep neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning and computer vision. One promising, yet only preliminarily explored approach, is feature inversion, which attempts to reconstruct images from intermediate representations using trained inverse neural networks. In this study, we revisit feature inversion, introducing a novel, modular variation that enables significantly more efficient application of the technique. We demonstrate how our method can be systematically applied to the large-scale transformer-based vision models, Detection Transformer and Vision Transformer, and how reconstructed images can be qualitatively interpreted in a meaningful way. We further quantitatively evaluate our method, thereby uncovering underlying mechanisms of representing image features that emerge in the two transformer architectures. Our analysis reveals key insights into how these models encode contextual shape and image details, how their layers correlate, and their robustness against color perturbations. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of transformer-based vision models and their internal representations. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at github.com/wiskott-lab/inverse-tvm.

Abstract: Traditional biometric systems have encountered significant setbacks due to various unavoidable factors, for example, wearing of face masks in face recognition-based biometrics and hygiene concerns in fingerprint-based biometrics. This paper proposes a novel lightweight vision transformer with phase-only cross-attention (POC-ViT) using dual biometric traits of forehead and periocular portions of the face, capable of performing well even with face masks and without any physical touch, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. The POC-ViT framework is designed to handle two biometric traits and to capture inter-dependencies in terms of relative structural patterns. Each channel consists of a Cross-Attention using phase-only correlation (POC) that captures both their individual and correlated structural patterns. The computation of cross-attention using POC extracts the phase correlation in the spatial features. Therefore, it is robust against variations in resolution and intensity, as well as illumination changes in the input images. The lightweight model is suitable for edge device deployment. The performance of the proposed framework was successfully demonstrated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database, having 350 subjects. The POC-ViT framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods with an outstanding classification accuracy of $98.8\%$ with the dual biometric traits.

Abstract: Triangle meshes are fundamental to 3D applications, enabling efficient modification and rasterization while maintaining compatibility with standard rendering pipelines. However, current automatic mesh generation methods typically rely on intermediate representations that lack the continuous surface quality inherent to meshes. Converting these representations into meshes produces dense, suboptimal outputs. Although recent autoregressive approaches demonstrate promise in directly modeling mesh vertices and faces, they are constrained by the limitation in face count, scalability, and structural fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose Nautilus, a locality-aware autoencoder for artist-like mesh generation that leverages the local properties of manifold meshes to achieve structural fidelity and efficient representation. Our approach introduces a novel tokenization algorithm that preserves face proximity relationships and compresses sequence length through locally shared vertices and edges, enabling the generation of meshes with an unprecedented scale of up to 5,000 faces. Furthermore, we develop a Dual-stream Point Conditioner that provides multi-scale geometric guidance, ensuring global consistency and local structural fidelity by capturing fine-grained geometric features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Nautilus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and scalability. The project page is at https://nautilusmeshgen.github.io.

<title>Leveraging Motion Estimation for Efficient Bayer-Domain Computer Vision</title>

Abstract: Existing computer vision processing pipeline acquires visual information using an image sensor that captures pixel information in the Bayer pattern. The raw sensor data are then processed using an image signal processor (ISP) that first converts Bayer pixel data to RGB on a pixel by pixel basis, followed by video convolutional network (VCN) processing on a frame by frame basis. Both ISP and VCN are computationally expensive with high power consumption and latency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that eliminates the ISP and leverages motion estimation to accelerate video vision tasks directly in the Bayer domain. We introduce Motion Estimation-based Video Convolution (MEVC), which integrates sliding-window motion estimation into each convolutional layer, enabling prediction and residual-based refinement that reduces redundant computations across frames. This design bridges the structural gap between block-based motion estimation and spatial convolution, enabling accurate, low-cost processing. Our end-to-end pipeline supports raw Bayer input and achieves over 70\% reduction in FLOPs with minimal accuracy degradation across video semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection benchmarks, using both synthetic Bayer-converted and real Bayer video datasets. This framework generalizes across convolution-based models and marks the first effective reuse of motion estimation for accelerating video computer vision directly from raw sensor data.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) tasks, such as referring expression detection and segmentation tasks are important for linking visual entities to context, especially in complex reasoning tasks that require detailed query interpretation. This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning. Our results show that NAVER achieves SoTA performance comparing to recent end-to-end and compositional baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ControlNet/NAVER .

Abstract: Despite the significant advances in domain generalized stereo matching, existing methods still exhibit domain-specific preferences when transferring from synthetic to real domains, hindering their practical applications in complex and diverse scenarios. The probability distributions predicted by the stereo network naturally encode rich similarity and uncertainty information. Inspired by this observation, we propose to extract these two types of dark knowledge from the pre-trained network to model intuitive multi-modal ground-truth distributions for both edge and non-edge regions. To mitigate the inherent domain preferences of a single network, we adopt network ensemble and further distinguish between objective and biased knowledge in the Laplace parameter space. Finally, the objective knowledge and the original disparity labels are jointly modeled as a mixture of Laplacians to provide fine-grained supervision for the stereo network training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) Our method is generic and effectively improves the generalization of existing networks. (2) PCWNet with our method achieves the state-of-the-art generalization performance on both KITTI 2015 and 2012 datasets. (3) Our method outperforms existing methods in comprehensive ranking across four popular real-world datasets.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to localize target trajectories in videos specified by natural language expressions. Despite recent progress, the intrinsic relationship between the two subtasks of tracking and referring in RMOT has not been fully studied. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of their interdependence, revealing that current two-stage Referring-by-Tracking (RBT) frameworks remain fundamentally limited by insufficient modeling of subtask interactions and inflexible reliance on semantic alignment modules like CLIP. To this end, we propose JustHook, a novel two-stage RBT framework where a Hook module is firstly designed to redefine the linkage between subtasks. The Hook is built centered on grid sampling at the feature-level and is used for context-aware target feature extraction. Moreover, we propose a Parallel Combined Decoder (PCD) that learns in a unified joint feature space rather than relying on pre-defined cross-modal embeddings. Our design not only enhances the interpretability and modularity but also significantly improves the generalization. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI, Refer-KITTI-V2, and Refer-Dance demonstrate that JustHook achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the HOTA by +6.9\% on Refer-KITTI-V2 with superior efficiency. Code will be available soon.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn knowledge of tasks observed in sequential time steps while mitigating the forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Existing methods were designed to learn a single modality (e.g., image) over time, which limits their applicability in scenarios involving multiple modalities. In this work, we propose a novel continual learning framework that accommodates multiple modalities (image, video, audio, depth, and text). We train a model to align various modalities with text, leveraging its rich semantic information. However, this increases the risk of forgetting previously learned knowledge, exacerbated by the differing input traits across tasks. To alleviate the overwriting of previous knowledge of modalities, we propose a framework that consolidates intra-modal knowledge while incorporating relevant inter-modal information. This is achieved by self-regulating shifts in learned representations to gradually integrating novel knowledge into the information retained across modalities. Simultaneously, it mitigates inter-modal interference by selectively integrating knowledge from previously encountered modalities based on their mutual relevance. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy to re-align modality embeddings, effectively addressing biased alignment between modalities. We evaluate the proposed method in a wide range of continual learning scenarios using multiple datasets with different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ours outperforms existing methods in the scenarios, regardless of whether the identity of the modality is given.

Abstract: We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark and toolkit for occupancy forecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical information) and occupancy prediction (i.e., predicting current-frame occupancy from camera images. UniOcc unifies the data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), providing 2D/3D occupancy labels and annotating innovative per-voxel flows. Unlike existing studies that rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel evaluation metrics that do not depend on ground-truth labels, enabling robust assessment on additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and forecasting performance.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on scaling open-vocabulary action detection. Existing approaches for action detection are predominantly limited to closed-set scenarios and rely on complex, parameter-heavy architectures. Extending these models to the open-vocabulary setting poses two key challenges: (1) the lack of large-scale datasets with many action classes for robust training, and (2) parameter-heavy adaptations to a pretrained vision-language contrastive model to convert it for detection, risking overfitting the additional non-pretrained parameters to base action classes. Firstly, we introduce an encoder-only multimodal model for video action detection, reducing the reliance on parameter-heavy additions for video action detection. Secondly, we introduce a simple weakly supervised training strategy to exploit an existing closed-set action detection dataset for pretraining. Finally, we depart from the ill-posed base-to-novel benchmark used by prior works in open-vocabulary action detection and devise a new benchmark to evaluate on existing closed-set action detection datasets without ever using them for training, showing novel results to serve as baselines for future work.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they continue to face challenges in achieving competitive performance on ordinal regression (OR; a.k.a. ordinal classification). To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that LLaVA model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5\% to 93.2\% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0\% to 85.7\% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets.

<title>CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting</title>

Abstract: Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty in counting in images.

Abstract: Detecting plant diseases is a crucial aspect of modern agriculture, as it plays a key role in maintaining crop health and increasing overall yield. Traditional approaches, though still valuable, often rely on manual inspection or conventional machine learning techniques, both of which face limitations in scalability and accuracy. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as improved handling of long-range dependencies and better scalability for visual tasks. This review explores the application of ViTs in precision agriculture, covering a range of tasks. We begin by introducing the foundational architecture of ViTs and discussing their transition from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Computer Vision. The discussion includes the concept of inductive bias in traditional models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and how ViTs mitigate these biases. We provide a comprehensive review of recent literature, focusing on key methodologies, datasets, and performance metrics. This study also includes a comparative analysis of CNNs and ViTs, along with a review of hybrid models and performance enhancements. Technical challenges such as data requirements, computational demands, and model interpretability are addressed, along with potential solutions. Finally, we outline future research directions and technological advancements that could further support the integration of ViTs in real-world agricultural settings. Our goal with this study is to offer practitioners and researchers a deeper understanding of how ViTs are poised to transform smart and precision agriculture.

Abstract: Masked video modeling~(MVM) has emerged as a highly effective pre-training strategy for visual foundation models, whereby the model reconstructs masked spatiotemporal tokens using information from visible tokens. However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge: cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at https://epsilontl.github.io/CCL-LGS/.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks, corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

Abstract: We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization, graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and 21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.

Abstract: In this paper, we present InfoMax, a novel data pruning method, also known as coreset selection, designed to maximize the information content of selected samples while minimizing redundancy. By doing so, InfoMax enhances the overall informativeness of the coreset. The information of individual samples is measured by importance scores, which capture their influence or difficulty in model learning. To quantify redundancy, we use pairwise sample similarities, based on the premise that similar samples contribute similarly to the learning process. We formalize the coreset selection problem as a discrete quadratic programming (DQP) task, with the objective of maximizing the total information content, represented as the sum of individual sample contributions minus the redundancies introduced by similar samples within the coreset. To ensure practical scalability, we introduce an efficient gradient-based solver, complemented by sparsification techniques applied to the similarity matrix and dataset partitioning strategies. This enables InfoMax to seamlessly scale to datasets with millions of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of InfoMax in various data pruning tasks, including image classification, vision-language pre-training, and instruction tuning for large language models.

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We present a framework for adapting a large pretrained latent diffusion model to high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image generation. The approach enables controllable synthesis and the creation of rare or out-of-distribution scenes beyond the training set. Rather than training a task-specific small model from scratch, we adapt an open-source text-to-image foundation model to the SAR modality, using its semantic prior to align prompts with SAR imaging physics (side-looking geometry, slant-range projection, and coherent speckle with heavy-tailed statistics). Using a 100k-image SAR dataset, we compare full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across the UNet diffusion backbone, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and the text encoders. Evaluation combines (i) statistical distances to real SAR amplitude distributions, (ii) textural similarity via Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) descriptors, and (iii) semantic alignment using a SAR-specialized CLIP model. Our results show that a hybrid strategy-full UNet tuning with LoRA on the text encoders and a learned token embedding-best preserves SAR geometry and texture while maintaining prompt fidelity. The framework supports text-based control and multimodal conditioning (e.g., segmentation maps, TerraSAR-X, or optical guidance), opening new paths for large-scale SAR scene data augmentation and unseen scenario simulation in Earth observation.

<title>Semantic Structure-Aware Generative Attacks for Enhanced Adversarial Transferability</title>

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

<title>VMem: Consistent Interactive Video Scene Generation with Surfel-Indexed View Memory</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel memory module for building video generators capable of interactively exploring environments. Previous approaches have achieved similar results either by out-painting 2D views of a scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry-which quickly accumulates errors-or by using video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a memory module that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost required to use all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with varying object and camera motions. We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) deblurring models on our dataset and observe significant performance degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and generalizable deblurring models.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text, predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production pipeline. The code is available at: https://github.com/SJTU-Lucy/MEDTalk.

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks. However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

<title>Common Data Properties Limit Object-Attribute Binding in CLIP</title>

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and, as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of ``a yellow submarine and a blue bus'' or ``a blue submarine and a yellow bus''. Previous attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in arguably the most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density, incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to describe the object that is ``most salient'' to them, have a detrimental effect on binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the data expresses our identified data properties does CLIP learn almost perfect binding.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations, we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities, enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11 benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at: https://github.com/zzeoZheng/HiCroPL.

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis. However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level, facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions. Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification. Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Recent advancements in Visual Question Answering (VQA) models offer promising tools for automatically analyzing complex classroom interactions from video recordings. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of several state-of-the-art open-source VQA models, including LLaMA2, LLaMA3, QWEN3, and NVILA, in the context of classroom behavior analysis. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce our BAV-Classroom-VQA dataset derived from real-world classroom video recordings at the Banking Academy of Vietnam. We present the methodology for data collection, annotation, and benchmark the performance of the selected VQA models on this dataset. Our initial experimental results demonstrate that all four models achieve promising performance levels in answering behavior-related visual questions, showcasing their potential in future classroom analytics and intervention systems.

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently, event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at https://github.com/suhang99/AsyncTrack-Motion-Solver.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality, but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%), while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector (DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization. Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models with domain-specific heuristics to transform medical data review. In a controlled experimental study with experienced medical reviewers (n=10), we demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a 6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by 15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. Economic analysis of a representative Phase III oncology trial reveals potential cost savings of $5.1 million, primarily driven by accelerated database lock timelines (5-day reduction saving $4.4M), improved medical review efficiency ($420K savings), and reduced query management burden ($288K savings). These improvements were consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially accelerating drug development timelines such as database lock by 33% while maintaining regulatory compliance and significantly reducing operational costs. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

<title>Improved Regularization and Robustness for Fine-tuning in Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2111.04578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely used algorithm for transfer learning is fine-tuning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a target task with a small amount of labeled data. When the capacity of the pre-trained model is significantly larger than the size of the target dataset, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and memorizing the training labels. Hence, a crucial question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness against noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling -- the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self-label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of image and text datasets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task. When the target data set includes noisy labels, our approach outperforms baseline methods by an average of 3.56% in two noisy settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning excels at learning representations from large amounts of data. At the same time, generative models offer the complementary property of learning information about the underlying data generation process. In this study, we aim at establishing a principled connection between these two paradigms and highlight the benefits of their complementarity. In particular, we perform an analysis of self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis suggests a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a lower bound proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes and unlocking full unification. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating that our objective function allows to jointly train a backbone network in a discriminative and generative fashion, consequently outperforming existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that the solution can be integrated into a neuro-symbolic framework to tackle a simple yet non-trivial instantiation of the symbol grounding problem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/emsansone/GEDI.

Abstract: The use of commercial Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) has surged in the past decade, offering societal benefits but also raising risks such as airspace violations and privacy concerns. Due to the increased security risks, the development of autonomous drone detection and tracking systems has become a priority. In this study, we tackle this challenge, by using non-repetitive rosette scanning pattern LiDARs, particularly focusing on increasing the detection distance by leveraging the characteristics of the sensor. The presented method utilizes a particle filter with a velocity component for the detection and tracking of the drone, which offers added re-detection capability. A Pan-Tilt platform is utilized to take advantage of the specific characteristics of the rosette scanning pattern LiDAR by keeping the tracked object in the center where the measurement is most dense. The detection capabilities and accuracy of the system are validated through indoor experiments, while the maximum detection distance is shown in our outdoor experiments. Our approach achieved accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art indoor method while increasing the maximum detection range by approximately 80\% beyond the state-of-the-art outdoor method.

Abstract: The performance of the standard Online Robust Principal Component Analysis (OR-PCA) technique depends on the optimum tuning of the explicit regularizers and this tuning is dataset sensitive. We aim to remove the dependency on these tuning parameters by using implicit regularization. We propose to use the implicit regularization effect of various modified gradient descents to make OR-PCA tuning free. Our method incorporates three different versions of modified gradient descent that separately but naturally encourage sparsity and low-rank structures in the data. The proposed method performs comparable or better than the tuned OR-PCA for both simulated and real-world datasets. Tuning-free ORPCA makes it more scalable for large datasets since we do not require dataset-dependent parameter tuning.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) are pivotal tasks in the realm of autonomous driving, attracting considerable research attention. While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.

Abstract: Due to their large sizes, volumetric scans and whole-slide pathology images (WSIs) are often processed by extracting embeddings from local regions and then an aggregator makes predictions from this set. However, current methods require post-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) and often fail to localize small yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we introduce INSIGHT, a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap generation as an inductive bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps, INSIGHT employs a detection module with small convolutional kernels to capture fine details and a context module with a broader receptive field to suppress local false positives. The resulting internal heatmap highlights diagnostically relevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art classification results and high weakly-labeled semantic segmentation performance.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. However, the increasing complexity of modern QD devices makes calibration and control -- particularly at elevated temperatures -- a bottleneck to progress, highlighting the need for robust and scalable autonomous solutions. A major hurdle arises from trapped charges within the oxide layers, which induce random offset voltage shifts on gate electrodes, with a standard deviation of approximately 83~\si{\milli\volt} of variation within state-of-the-art present-day devices. Efficient characterization and tuning of large arrays of QD qubits depend on choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a physically intuitive framework for a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing, formation of all current channels, and gate characterization in the presence of trapped charges. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single set of measurements regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at $1.3$~\si{\kelvin} on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.

Abstract: Femoral artery access is essential for numerous clinical procedures, including diagnostic angiography, therapeutic catheterization, and emergency interventions. Despite its critical role, successful vascular access remains challenging due to anatomical variability, overlying adipose tissue, and the need for precise ultrasound (US) guidance. Needle placement errors can result in severe complications, thereby limiting the procedure to highly skilled clinicians operating in controlled hospital environments. While robotic systems have shown promise in addressing these challenges through autonomous scanning and vessel reconstruction, clinical translation remains limited due to reliance on simplified phantom models that fail to capture human anatomical complexity. In this work, we present a method for autonomous robotic US scanning of bifurcated femoral arteries, and validate it on five vascular phantoms created from real patient computed tomography (CT) data. Additionally, we introduce a video-based deep learning US segmentation network tailored for vascular imaging, enabling improved 3D arterial reconstruction. The proposed network achieves a Dice score of 89.21% and an Intersection over Union of 80.54% on a new vascular dataset. The reconstructed artery centerline is evaluated against ground truth CT data, showing an average L2 error of 0.91+/-0.70 mm, with an average Hausdorff distance of 4.36+/-1.11mm. This study is the first to validate an autonomous robotic system for US scanning of the femoral artery on a diverse set of patient-specific phantoms, introducing a more advanced framework for evaluating robotic performance in vascular imaging and intervention.

Abstract: Automatically synthesizing figures from text captions is a compelling capability. However, achieving high geometric precision and editability requires representing figures as graphics programs in languages like TikZ, and aligned training data (i.e., graphics programs with captions) remains scarce. Meanwhile, large amounts of unaligned graphics programs and captioned raster images are more readily available. We reconcile these disparate data sources by presenting TikZero, which decouples graphics program generation from text understanding by using image representations as an intermediary bridge. It enables independent training on graphics programs and captioned images and allows for zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference. We show that our method substantially outperforms baselines that can only operate with caption-aligned graphics programs. Furthermore, when leveraging caption-aligned graphics programs as a complementary training signal, TikZero matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including commercial systems like GPT-4o. Our code, datasets, and select models are publicly available.

Abstract: Capturing high-quality visual content under low-light conditions remains a challenging problem due to severe noise and underexposure, which degrade the performance of downstream applications. Traditional frame-based low-light image enhancement methods often amplify noise or fail to preserve structural details. Event cameras, offering high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution by asynchronously capturing brightness changes, emerge as a promising complement for low-light imaging. However, existing fusion methods fail to fully exploit this synergy, either by forcing modalities into a shared representation too early or by losing vital low-level correlations through isolated processing. To address these challenges, we propose EvRWKV, a novel framework that enables continuous cross-modal interaction through dual-domain processing. Our approach incorporates a Cross-RWKV module, leveraging the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture for fine-grained temporal and cross-modal fusion, and an Event Image Spectral Fusion Enhancer (EISFE) module, which jointly performs adaptive frequency-domain noise suppression and spatial-domain deformable convolution alignment. This continuous interaction maintains feature consistency from low-level textures to high-level semantics. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on real-world low-light datasets (SDE, SDSD, RELED) demonstrate that EvRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively enhancing image quality by suppressing noise, restoring structural details, and improving visual clarity in challenging low-light conditions.

Abstract: In recent years, Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30 of the computational resources and 20 GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module (MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and 13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing, yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT) stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset (Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably, the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper, we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge, salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method -- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and interpretable cognitive attack detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and autonomous vehicle networks.

Summary: 
Affective computing is hindered by the lack of high-quality, diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. The proposed framework utilizes a synthetic depth face generation approach using an optimized GAN with Knowledge Distillation to enhance training stability, quality, and prevent mode collapse. Incorporating Genetic Algorithms to evolve GAN latent vectors based on image statistics significantly boosts diversity and visual quality for target emotions, outperforming traditional methods such as GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE. For emotion classification, feature extraction including LBP, HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features achieve high accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation metrics including FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR consistently show superior performance compared to existing approaches. <div>

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality, diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP, HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96% accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Keywords: Visual Instruction Finetuning, VLMs, Multimodal data, Data-efficient framework, Model-agnostic design<br />
<br />Summary: 
Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is crucial for improving post-training Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning, VIF requires both visual and textual data for joint understanding. The challenge lies in selecting the right data efficiently while maintaining quality and alignment. The proposed $\Delta$-AttnMask framework addresses this by quantifying sample quality through attention-guided masking of hidden states without the need for domain labels or extra training. Experiments show that $\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data, speeding up training by 5x and outperforming full-dataset baselines by +10.1% in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design makes it applicable across various modalities and architectures.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that $\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data, accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1% in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad applicability across modalities and architectures.

<div> Keywords: Facial expression recognition, source-free domain adaptation, personalized feature translation, latent space, unlabeled target data


Summary:
Facial expression recognition (FER) models are crucial for affective computing applications. However, deep FER models face challenges with subtle expressions and inter-subject variability. To address this, a source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) method called personalized feature translation (PFT) is proposed. PFT operates in the latent space, pre-training a translator on source data to transform subject-specific style features. This translator is then adapted using only unlabeled target data with neutral expressions, without the need for source data or image synthesis. By translating in the latent space, PFT creates discriminative embeddings optimized for classification, avoiding the complexity and computational overhead of image-based translation. PFT offers a lightweight and efficient solution for personalized adaptation of FER models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy, storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class. Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another. Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

<div> benchmark, emotional intelligence, large language models, reasoning capabilities, multimodal understanding

Summary:
Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have improved emotional intelligence in affective computing. However, current emotional benchmarks have limitations in generalization abilities and reasoning capabilities. To address these gaps, MME-Emotion, a comprehensive benchmark, evaluates emotional understanding and reasoning in MLLMs across diverse scenarios using QA pairs. Analyzing 20 MLLMs, it reveals that current models perform poorly in emotional intelligence and that generalist models like Gemini-2.5-Pro excel in multimodal understanding, while specialist models like R1-Omni achieve comparable results through domain-specific post-training. MME-Emotion aims to enhance emotional intelligence in MLLMs for future progress. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress, current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and \textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$ recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark. \ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion, we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional intelligence in the future.

<title>Towards Effective MLLM Jailbreaking Through Balanced On-Topicness and OOD-Intensity</title>

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, adversarial prompts, evaluation framework, jailbreak strategies, Balanced Structural Decomposition

Summary: 
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to adversarial prompts, prompting the need for effective safety mechanisms. Current evaluation standards may overestimate the success of jailbreak strategies, leading researchers to introduce a four-axis evaluation framework focusing on input relevance and harmful output. A structural trade-off is identified, where prompts balancing relevance and novelty tend to evade filters, triggering dangerous output. To address this, the Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD) strategy is developed, restructuring prompts into sub-tasks with subtle out-of-distribution signals. Testing across various MLLMs, BSD consistently improves attack success rates, harmfulness of outputs, and reduces refusals compared to previous methods. This highlights a vulnerability in current multimodal safety systems, with BSD showing a $67\%$ success rate improvement and a $21\%$ increase in harmful outputs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off: highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content. However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD). The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

Summary: 
The field of Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has been limited by a lack of data, as manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. To address this issue, a new method has been proposed that combines limited handwritten formulas with large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas. This has led to the creation of the Tex80M dataset, which is the largest formula dataset to date with over 80 million training instances. The TexTeller model, trained at scale using the Tex80M dataset and a small HME dataset, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. The model, dataset, and codebase will be openly released to encourage further research in the field. This innovative approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition.

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of \textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression \textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80 million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller}, the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further research building upon our contributions.

Summary: 
GDAGS introduces a gradient-direction-aware framework to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting for improved view synthesis. It addresses issues of over-reconstruction and over-densification in complex scenes by prioritizing conflicting-gradient Gaussians for splitting and concordant-gradient Gaussians for densification. The gradient coherence ratio (GCR) and dynamic weighting mechanism play crucial roles in adaptive density control. Evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality while reducing memory consumption by 50%. It achieves superior geometric detail enhancement, suppresses unnecessary component proliferation, and constructs compact scene representations. GDAGS offers a more efficient and effective approach to Gaussian splatting for realistic and optimized rendering outcomes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control. Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized Gaussians utilization.

The article introduces FineState-Bench, an innovative evaluation framework for GUI agents focusing on fine-grained control capabilities. The existing benchmarks are criticized for emphasizing task completion and neglecting crucial control aspects. FineState-Bench includes 2257 task benchmarks across different platforms and employs a four-phase indicator for thorough assessment. A Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA) is developed for analyzing perception and positioning in GUI operations. Experimental results reveal that current models achieve only 32.8% accuracy in fine-grained interactions. The study demonstrates that visual positioning is the primary bottleneck for GUI proxies. Additionally, using the VDA in controlled experiments showed a significant boost in success rates with improved visual localization. All resources, including the framework and dataset, are open-source, contributing to further research and development in the field. <div>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions. However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations, designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web, mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8% fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments, quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully open-source. github: https://github.com/AnonymousThewarehouse/FineState-Bench huggingface: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Willtime2006/Static-FineBench

Summary: <br />
Visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) are becoming more prevalent, raising concerns about user privacy, especially for blind and low vision users. Existing privacy protection methods often use coarse-grained segmentation, which can lead to usability issues by uniformly masking entire private objects. In response, the FiGPriv framework has been proposed, which integrates fine-grained segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism to selectively mask high-risk private information while preserving low-risk content. Evaluation using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset showed that FiG-Priv can preserve 26% more image content, improve the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by 11%, and enhance the identification of image content by 45%, all while ensuring privacy protection.

Summary:<br />
An emerging approach in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) involves history-aware multi-modal transformer models that analyze observation and navigation history to guide agent actions. While these models have shown improved performance, their large scale can pose challenges in practical settings with limited computational resources. This study introduces innovative input-adaptive navigation techniques to enhance VLN model efficiency. Existing input-adaptive methods were found to be ineffective in reducing computations without sacrificing performance. The authors propose three adaptive algorithms to address this issue: selectively processing panoramic views, importance-based adaptive thresholding for early-exit methods, and implementing a caching mechanism to prevent reprocessing of previously seen views. Evaluation on seven VLN benchmarks revealed a notable 2x reduction in computation across standard and continuous environments for three off-the-shelf agents. The code for these adaptive algorithms is available on GitHub. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/secure-ai-systems-group/adaptive-vision-and-language-navigation.

Summary: <br />
Visual reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complex nature of learning both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards. The integration of large perception models into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency has been a key challenge. In response, the proposed SegDAC method combines Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground segments semantically with text prompts. It incorporates a novel transformer-based architecture that dynamically handles the number of segments at each time step, learning which segments to focus on through online RL without human labels. Evaluation on the Maniskill3 benchmark, covering various manipulation tasks under visual perturbations, shows that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, even doubling previous performance on the most challenging setting. Additionally, SegDAC matches or surpasses prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks. <br /> <div>

Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks, such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves 8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM. Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks. We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules, highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging.

<div> Keywords: sign language recognition, healthcare communication, FusionEnsemble-Net, spatiotemporal networks, multimodal gestures

Summary:
Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication is challenging due to the complexity of multimodal gestures. The FusionEnsemble-Net proposed in this study addresses this challenge by dynamically fusing visual and motion data through four different spatiotemporal networks. By employing an attention-based fusion module, features from RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities are merged and fed into an ensemble of classifiers. The ensemble classification head then combines the outputs of these fused channels, resulting in enhanced model robustness. Experimental results on the MultiMeDaLIS dataset for Italian Sign Language show that FusionEnsemble-Net achieves a test accuracy of 99.44%, outperforming existing approaches. This study highlights the effectiveness of using an ensemble of spatiotemporal networks unified by attention-based fusion for accurate recognition of complex, multimodal isolated gestures in sign language communication.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net, a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network, features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) presents challenges such as inter-signer variability and limited generalization to new sentence structures. To address these issues, a dual-architecture framework is proposed. A Signer-Invariant Conformer is introduced for the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, using convolutions and multi-head self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, a Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a dual-path temporal encoder captures fine-grained posture dynamics to comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the Isharah-1000 dataset show significant improvements, with the proposed conformer architecture achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on the SI challenge and the transformer model scoring a WER of 47.78% on the US task. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of task-specific networks in CSLR and set a new benchmark for future research efforts. Source code is available on GitHub for reference. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges, including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work. In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research.

<div> Keywords: medical image segmentation, skin lesion, inter-annotator variability, malignancy, dermoscopic images <br />
Summary: <br />
This study introduces IMA++, a large dataset for skin lesion segmentation, to investigate variability among annotators based on factors such as malignancy, tool, and skill level. The research reveals a significant association between inter-annotator agreement and the malignancy of skin lesions, with higher agreement for malignant cases. The study also demonstrates accurate prediction of agreement directly from dermoscopic images. Leveraging this association as a clinical feature in multi-task learning improves model performance across datasets, showing a 4.2% increase in balanced accuracy. The code for the study is openly available for further research and development. <div>
arXiv:2508.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA), measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic datasets.

<div> Keywords: X-UniMotion, human motion, latent representation, cross-identity motion transfer, end-to-end framework

Summary:
X-UniMotion introduces a unified latent representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions, body poses, and hand gestures. This representation is highly expressive and identity-agnostic, allowing for detailed cross-identity motion transfer. The approach encodes motion directly from a single image into four disentangled latent tokens, facilitating superior motion fidelity and identity preservation. A self-supervised framework is used to learn the motion encoder and latent representation, alongside a video generative model, on diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is enforced using various techniques, while auxiliary decoders guide the learning of motion tokens for fine-grained and depth-aware embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that X-UniMotion outperforms existing methods, producing animations with high expressiveness and realism. <br /><br />Summary: X-UniMotion offers an innovative approach to human motion representation, enabling detailed and cross-identity motion transfer with superior fidelity and identity preservation. <div>

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions, body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression, one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses, and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised, end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained, semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Summary: 
The article introduces DenoDet V2, a novel approach for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection that tackles the challenge of coherent noise. DenoDet V2 utilizes a unique attention architecture to deconstruct and modulate features in the transform domain, focusing on the complementary nature of amplitude and phase information. By implementing a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, DenoDet V2 achieves reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra, leading to superior performance compared to DenoDet V1. Extensive experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art capabilities of DenoDet V2, showcasing a significant 0.8% improvement on the SARDet-100K dataset while reducing model complexity by half. The code for DenoDet V2 is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2 is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\% improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the model complexity by half.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a cost-effective system for monitoring backyard birds in Belgian urban gardens. The system uses a motion-triggered IP camera to capture footage, which is then analyzed by Detectron2 for bird localization. Cropped images are classified using an EfficientNet-B3 model trained on a 40-species subset specific to Belgium. The processing is done locally on standard hardware without the need for a discrete GPU, ensuring privacy and avoiding cloud costs. By excluding pigeons and reducing nuisance triggers with small entry ports on the feeder, the system improves classification accuracy. The classifier achieves high validation performance on the curated subset and practical field accuracy on additional species, making it suitable for citizen science biodiversity monitoring at home.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard bird monitoring in Belgian urban gardens. A motion triggered IP camera uploads short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers. Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy (top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios, including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to 250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human behavior understanding in complex urban environments.

Summary: 
Curb ramps are crucial for urban accessibility, but detecting them accurately in images has been a challenge due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. This paper introduces RampNet, a two-stage pipeline to address this issue. In Stage 1, a dataset of over 210,000 annotated Google Street View panoramas is generated by translating government curb ramp location data into pixel coordinates. In Stage 2, a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) is trained on the generated dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The dataset achieves a precision of 94.0% and recall of 92.5%, while the detection model reaches 0.9236 AP. By comparing with manually labeled panoramas, the pipeline's effectiveness is demonstrated, exceeding previous work. This study contributes the first large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches 0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

Summary:<br />
The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task involves locating a specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions. The GOAL framework, proposed in this work, is a generative flow-based approach that models the semantic distribution of indoor environments. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to encode spatial priors as two-dimensional Gaussian fields, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. By bridging observed regions with LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps, GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson datasets. It also demonstrates strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. The framework's ability to capture uncertainty in indoor layouts and leverage contextual knowledge from language models makes it a valuable tool for tasks requiring object localization in complex environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work, we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D.

This task is addressed by a framework called PaIR-Net, consisting of three key components: the Contact Prior Aware Module (CPAM), the Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS), and the Interaction Inference Module (IIM). The proposed task is enabled by the newly created PaIR dataset, containing a wide variety of images with actions, object categories, and body parts. Experimental results show that PaIR-Net outperforms baseline methods, with ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of each component. The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon publication. <div>

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and \textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon publication.

<div> Keywords: Micro-expression recognition, Motion Prompt Tuning, Facial movements, Training samples, Affective computing

Summary: 
Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) is proposed as a new method for adapting large pre-training models to micro-expression recognition (MER) tasks. This approach focuses on capturing subtle facial movements essential for effective MER by generating motion prompts through motion magnification and Gaussian tokenization. A group adapter is integrated into the pre-training model to enhance its ability to represent micro-expressions accurately. Experimental results on three MER datasets demonstrate that the MPT approach outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in improving MER performance. This novel technique addresses challenges in obtaining ME annotations and the scarcity of training samples in MER datasets. MPT offers a promising solution for leveraging large pre-training models for the nuanced recognition of micro-expressions, with implications for medical diagnosis, lie detection, and criminal investigation.

arXiv:2508.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression (ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models. While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its effectiveness.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR) as a practical solution to the limitations of existing Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) methods. RASR leverages semantic retrieval of high-resolution images from a reference database to enhance texture fidelity and visual realism in scenarios where manually curated target-reference pairs are not feasible. The RASR-Flickr30 benchmark dataset is introduced to support open-world retrieval, unlike previous datasets with fixed pairs. RASRNet, a proposed baseline model, combines semantic reference retrieval with a diffusion-based RefSR generator, resulting in improved PSNR and LPIPS metrics compared to Single Image Super Resolution methods. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RASR in generating realistic textures and highlight the potential of retrieval augmentation in bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131 LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

<div> knowledge distillation, hyperspectral remote sensing, foundation models, spectral disparities, geospatial applications

Summary: 
HyperKD introduces a novel knowledge distillation framework for transferring learned representations from a teacher model to a student model in hyperspectral remote sensing. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation frameworks, HyperKD enables inverse knowledge transfer across different spectral data types, guided by a simpler teacher model. By distilling knowledge from the Prithvi foundational model into a student model tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery, HyperKD addresses the spectral domain gap with spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperKD significantly improves representation learning in Masked Autoencoders, leading to enhanced reconstruction fidelity and improved performance in downstream tasks such as land cover classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction. This highlights the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery. HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction, underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

<div> Keywords: Character animation, Anthropomorphic characters, Motion representation, Multi-task training, Realistic videos

Summary:
Animate-X++ is a new universal animation framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods for character image animation. It is able to generate high-quality videos for various character types, including anthropomorphic characters, by using a Pose Indicator to capture comprehensive motion patterns from driving videos. The framework also utilizes a multi-task training strategy to jointly train the animation and background dynamics tasks, resulting in more realistic videos with text-driven background dynamics. Additionally, Animate-X++ introduces a new benchmark, A2Bench, for evaluating its performance on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive experiments show the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++ in generating realistic and diverse character animations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation, we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions, while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

<div> attack, vision-language models, backdoor, input-aware, security

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel input-aware backdoor attack method, IAG, aimed at manipulating the grounding behavior of vision-language models (VLMs). The attack forces the model to identify a specific target object in an image, regardless of the user's query. An adaptive trigger generator is proposed to embed semantic information into the image, overcoming the open-vocabulary challenge. Stealthiness is ensured using a reconstruction loss to minimize visual differences between poisoned and clean images. A unified method for generating attack data is introduced. The effectiveness of IAG is theoretically and empirically evaluated, achieving an ASR@0.5 over 65% on various testing sets, with promising results on other datasets. Specific experiments, such as ablation studies and potential defense mechanisms, demonstrate the attack's robustness and transferability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image, regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our attack.

arXiv:2508.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual manipulation localization across images and videos.

Our framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable and modality-agnostic VML.

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However, existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions. GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

Summary: 
This paper explores the energy-efficient robust fitting of geometric models using neuromorphic computing. It addresses the lack of attention to energy efficiency in robust fitting, crucial due to the increasing concern about high energy consumption in AI applications. The study introduces a novel spiking neural network designed for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, specifically the Intel Loihi 2. The researchers develop event-driven formulations of model estimation that can be implemented on the Loihi 2 architecture, along with algorithmic strategies to overcome hardware limitations. Results indicate that the neuromorphic robust fitting approach consumes only 15% of the energy compared to running the standard robust fitting algorithm on a CPU, while achieving equivalent accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi 2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

The model addresses challenges of non-uniform data distribution and semantic label discrepancies between datasets. It uses a local-global cross-attention network and hierarchical classification strategy.

arXiv:2508.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive 3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces FTNet, a Few-shot Training-free Network for real-world deepfake detection. Unlike traditional methods, FTNet does not require training on large-scale known data but uses only one fake sample during evaluation. By comparing each test sample to known fake and real samples, FTNet classifies it based on the nearest sample category. The study analyzes AI-generated images from 29 generative models, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 8.7%. The approach emphasizes leveraging failed samples for better performance in real-world scenarios where models struggle to generalize on few-shot samples.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a ``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task, where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding, deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network (FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set, mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation, each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\% compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

<div> Mixture of Facial Experts, Identity Preservation, Video Generation, Large Facial Angles Dataset, Data Processing Pipeline

Summary:
The article introduces a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) model to address challenges in video generation related to identity preservation under large facial angles. The MoFE combines three specialized experts to capture different aspects of facial attributes: identity, semantics, and details. A data processing pipeline tailored to include Face Constraints and Identity Consistency ensures diversity in facial angles and coherent person-specific features in the dataset. A Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset comprising 460K video clips is curated to provide training data with annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The code and dataset are made publicly available for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations. First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.

<div> Keywords: AI-generated images, anomaly detection, CLIP encoder, unsupervised learning, proxy images

Summary:
Anomaly detection is used to create a universal AI-generated image detector that does not rely on specific AIIs for training. The discriminator utilizes a pre-trained CLIP encoder as a feature extractor and an unsupervised model inspired by normalizing flow techniques. Instead of AIIs, proxy images generated by modifying natural images are used for training. The model is trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images, with the option of also maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of this approach on AI-generated images from various generators. <div>
arXiv:2508.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images, which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs (generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images, optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by various image generators.

<div> Approach, GazeLT, human visual attention, long-tailed disease classification, deep learning

Summary:
The article introduces GazeLT, a novel approach for long-tailed disease classification that integrates and disintegrates human visual attention patterns during image interpretation. It leverages the temporal aspect of visual search processes and incorporates both fine-grained and coarser level disease-related information observed in a radiologist's eye gaze. The approach aims to improve automated image interpretation by capturing minor/incidental findings, especially in long-tailed disease classes. GazeLT is evaluated on the NIH-CXR-LT and MIMIC-CXR-LT datasets, outperforming existing long-tailed loss methods and visual attention-based baselines. The average accuracy metrics show a significant improvement, with GazeLT achieving a 4.1% increase over the best long-tailed loss and a 21.7% improvement over the visual attention-based baseline. The code for GazeLT is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes) during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism, to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification, namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets. GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

<div> sparse-view satellite images, 3D scene reconstruction, SkySplat, self-supervised framework, RPC model

Summary: 
SkySplat is a novel self-supervised framework designed to tackle the challenges of 3D scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images. By integrating the RPC model into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, SkySplat effectively utilizes sparse geometric cues for improved reconstruction without the need for ground-truth height maps. The Cross-Self Consistency Module (CSCM) helps to mitigate transient object interference, while a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy refines the reconstruction results. SkySplat outperforms existing methods, achieving an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy. It significantly reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 13.18 m to 1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark. <div>
arXiv:2508.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential, but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable 3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy. It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to 1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

Summary:
Video-EM is a novel framework designed to enhance video question answering by addressing the limitations of existing keyframe retrieval methods for long-form videos. Inspired by human episodic memory, Video-EM models keyframes as temporally ordered events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics for better narrative reconstruction. By leveraging chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs, Video-EM efficiently identifies a minimal yet informative subset of episodic memories, leading to improved question-answering performance. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Video-EM, achieving performance gains of 4-9 percent over baselines while using fewer frames.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently, recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information, diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore, the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs. Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

<title>SARE: Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error for Generalizable Diffusion-Generated Image Detection</title>

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, image detection, semantic-aware reconstruction error, fake images, generative models

Summary:
Semantic-aware reconstruction error (SARE) is proposed as a novel method for detecting fake images generated by diverse generative models. The concept behind SARE is that fake images exhibit higher similarity to their captions compared to real images, leading to minimal semantic shifts during caption-guided reconstruction. This property is leveraged to differentiate between real and fake images, enabling robust detection across various generative models. SARE outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like GenImage and CommunityForensics, showcasing strong generalization capabilities. By quantifying semantic differences between images and their caption-guided reconstructions, SARE serves as a discriminative feature for improved detection performance in the context of diffusion-generated images. <div>
arXiv:2508.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models, since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images. Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images, which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization, outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and CommunityForensics.

Summary: <br />
- The study introduces CWFBind, a docking method that incorporates local curvature features for accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding conformations.
- CWFBind enhances geometric representation by integrating local curvature descriptors, improving pocket localization and interaction strength capture.
- The method includes degree-aware weighting mechanisms in the message passing process to better capture spatial structural distinctions.
- To address class imbalance in pocket prediction, CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy and an enhanced loss function.

arXiv:2508.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information, resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction, CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network (ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12, respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements (AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

Summary: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have transformed computer vision but lack explicit spatial biases, affecting performance on structured tasks. Existing approaches use fixed distance metrics for attention weighting, limiting adaptability. Inspired by language models, the new Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT) introduces Context-Aware Gating (CAG) for dynamic, data-dependent decay. This modulates spatial attention based on content relevance and proximity. Addressing the 1D-to-2D adaptation challenge, SDT integrates spatial priors with content representations. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show improvements over baselines, establishing data-dependent spatial decay as a new approach for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics, applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX) significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing (CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements. To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks' superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents, called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations. We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module, correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$ improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching (IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

arXiv:2508.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation (GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and (2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies, one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain generalization.

arXiv:2508.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e., closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments, we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

<title>Topological Invariant-Based Iris Identification via Digital Homology and Machine Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids (e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN, and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy, outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact, interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing, and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather, and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog and snow conditions.

However, current multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

<title>Dual Recursive Feedback on Generation and Appearance Latents for Pose-Robust Text-to-Image Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF) system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models. The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is available at https://github.com/jwonkm/DRF.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs, we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and 6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios. Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

Abstract: This paper introduces BAAS, a new Extended Object Tracking (EOT) and fusion-based label annotation framework for radar detections in autonomous driving. Our framework utilizes Bayesian-based tracking, smoothing and eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic objects and class types

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

<title>SVG-Head: Hybrid Surface-Volumetric Gaussians for High-Fidelity Head Reconstruction and Real-Time Editing</title>

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation, head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results, but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores, state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images, especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work, we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

<title>BridgeTA: Bridging the Representation Gap in Knowledge Distillation via Teacher Assistant for Bird's Eye View Map Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09599</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first 3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full 3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics, scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11 clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10) dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

<title>Plane Detection and Ranking via Model Information Optimization</title>

arXiv:2508.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation, which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in real-world data.

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS), traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness. Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism, demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures, contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability. Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are available at https://github.com/sysll/MCFM.

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts (points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module, which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result. Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift. Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes. Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem, ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided neurosurgery.

Abstract: Robust ball tracking under occlusion remains a key challenge in sports video analysis, affecting tasks like event detection and officiating. We present TOTNet, a Temporal Occlusion Tracking Network that leverages 3D convolutions, visibility-weighted loss, and occlusion augmentation to improve performance under partial and full occlusions. Developed in collaboration with Paralympics Australia, TOTNet is designed for real-world sports analytics. We introduce TTA, a new occlusion-rich table tennis dataset collected from professional-level Paralympic matches, comprising 9,159 samples with 1,996 occlusion cases. Evaluated on four datasets across tennis, badminton, and table tennis, TOTNet significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE from 37.30 to 7.19 and improving accuracy on fully occluded frames from 0.63 to 0.80. These results demonstrate TOTNets effectiveness for offline sports analytics in fast-paced scenarios. Code and data access:\href{https://github.com/AugustRushG/TOTNet}{AugustRushG/TOTNet}.

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping, facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data, thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness. Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability, leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from 2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations. To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs. The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

<title>Surg-InvNeRF: Invertible NeRF for 3D tracking and reconstruction in surgical vision</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09681</link>

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field (InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable NeRF-based reconstruction.

<title>PaCo-FR: Patch-Pixel Aligned End-to-End Codebook Learning for Facial Representation Pre-training</title>

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2 million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance. This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma geNet, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

<title>MangaDiT: Reference-Guided Line Art Colorization with Hierarchical Attention in Diffusion Transformers</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT). Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features, effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

<title>NEURAL: Attention-Guided Pruning for Unified Multimodal Resource-Constrained Clinical Evaluation</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays, preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent, task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/NEURAL.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates. Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection. However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular, graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid diagnostics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/MMSN/.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii) a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision that can be used downstream for fault detection.

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment. Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark. M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical design.

<title>Region-to-Region: Enhancing Generative Image Harmonization with Adaptive Regional Injection</title>

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely, generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements. To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However, these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy, which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/MoIIE.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching, to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration. In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method, consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page: https://nahyuklee.github.io/cmnet.

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely, we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue as well.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter (MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU (Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of 67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention (MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR material datasets.

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of \textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue, from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and \textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\% Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels. Our tool is publicly available at surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PhotoTools.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the learned physical parameters.

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from 2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again -- WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations, improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

<title>ViMoNet: A Multimodal Vision-Language Framework for Human Behavior Understanding from Motion and Video</title>

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion understanding, and behavior interpretation.

<title>Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action Pretraining</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09822</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

<title>Reverse Convolution and Its Applications to Image Restoration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09824</link>

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications.

<title>RayletDF: Raylet Distance Fields for Generalizable 3D Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds or Gaussians</title>

arXiv:2508.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward pass across unseen datasets in testing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity. Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation. To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

arXiv:2508.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on a small-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset, evaluating both unconditional and conditional pipelines. Our study compares UNet and DiT architectures for unconditional generation and explores LoRA-based fine-tuning of pretrained Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume. Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size, data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

<title>OneVAE: Joint Discrete and Continuous Optimization Helps Discrete Video VAE Train Better</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation. Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time, and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence. Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second, to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x 16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time, achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect this connection.

arXiv:2508.09858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However, current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency} and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these, we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1) \textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2) \textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion, refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis, video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

<title>COME: Dual Structure-Semantic Learning with Collaborative MoE for Universal Lesion Detection Across Heterogeneous Ultrasound Datasets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions, especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises: how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME). Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that create a universal representation space and then collaborate with source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

arXiv:2508.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range. Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel approach for rapid scene capture.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any fake video in model training.

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts, HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by 5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to low-resource HTR.

arXiv:2508.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 % of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM) above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render' approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait video manipulation.

To address this, we introduce three primary contributions. First, we present the January Food Benchmark (JFB), a publicly available collection of 1,000 food images with human-validated annotations. Second, we detail a comprehensive benchmarking framework, including robust metrics and a novel, application-oriented overall score designed to assess model performance holistically. Third, we provide baseline results from both general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and our own specialized model, january/food-vision-v1. Our evaluation demonstrates that the specialized model achieves an Overall Score of 86.2, a 12.1-point improvement over the best-performing general-purpose configuration. This work offers the research community a valuable new evaluation dataset and a rigorous framework to guide and benchmark future developments in automated nutritional analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI) classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC) comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions, offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic training data is severely limited.

<title>PERSONA: Personalized Whole-Body 3D Avatar with Pose-Driven Deformations from a Single Image</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09973</link>

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first, a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach, learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement. We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them. To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse poses.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D scene representation, offering high-fidelity photorealistic rendering with real-time performance. Beyond novel view synthesis, the explicit and compact nature of 3DGS enables a wide range of downstream applications that require geometric and semantic understanding. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in 3DGS applications. It first introduces 2D foundation models that support semantic understanding and control in 3DGS applications, followed by a review of NeRF-based methods that inform their 3DGS counterparts. We then categorize 3DGS applications into segmentation, editing, generation, and other functional tasks. For each, we summarize representative methods, supervision strategies, and learning paradigms, highlighting shared design principles and emerging trends. Commonly used datasets and evaluation protocols are also summarized, along with comparative analyses of recent methods across public benchmarks. To support ongoing research and development, a continually updated repository of papers, code, and resources is maintained at https://github.com/heshuting555/Awesome-3DGS-Applications.

<title>LLMC+: Benchmarking Vision-Language Model Compression with a Plug-and-play Toolkit</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09981</link>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods. However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1) Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules, hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2) Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques, without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile, plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3) Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/LightCompress.

<title>Story2Board: A Training-Free Approach for Expressive Storyboard Generation</title>

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components: Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning, enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts. To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards. Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging storyboards than existing baselines.

<title>Echo-4o: Harnessing the Power of GPT-4o Synthetic Images for Improved Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09987</link>

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind. Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data? In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries. Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o. In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

<title>MoLAN: A Unified Modality-Aware Noise Dynamic Editing Framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions. However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework. Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/betterfly123/MoLAN-Framework.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached 0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current optimal large-scale pre-training model ECGFounder, it has improved by 0.111 and 0.19.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is widely used in front-end development and UI/UX design due to its scalability, editability, and rendering efficiency. However, turning creative ideas into precise vector graphics remains a time-consuming challenge. To address this, we introduce SVG-1M, a large-scale dataset of high-quality SVGs paired with natural language descriptions. Through advanced data augmentation and annotation, we create well-aligned Text to SVG training pairs, including a subset with Chain of Thought annotations for enhanced semantic guidance. Based on this dataset, we propose SVGen, an end-to-end model that generates SVG code from natural language inputs. Our approach ensures semantic accuracy and structural completeness, supported by curriculum learning and reinforcement learning optimization. Experiments show that SVGen outperforms general large models and traditional rendering methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and dataset are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming medical imaging by enabling capabilities such as data synthesis, image enhancement, modality translation, and spatiotemporal modeling. This review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of recent advances in generative modeling including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models, and emerging multimodal foundation architectures and evaluates their expanding roles across the clinical imaging continuum. We systematically examine how generative AI contributes to key stages of the imaging workflow, from acquisition and reconstruction to cross-modality synthesis, diagnostic support, and treatment planning. Emphasis is placed on both retrospective and prospective clinical scenarios, where generative models help address longstanding challenges such as data scarcity, standardization, and integration across modalities. To promote rigorous benchmarking and translational readiness, we propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing pixel-level fidelity, feature-level realism, and task-level clinical relevance. We also identify critical obstacles to real-world deployment, including generalization under domain shift, hallucination risk, data privacy concerns, and regulatory hurdles. Finally, we explore the convergence of generative AI with large-scale foundation models, highlighting how this synergy may enable the next generation of scalable, reliable, and clinically integrated imaging systems. By charting technical progress and translational pathways, this review aims to guide future research and foster interdisciplinary collaboration at the intersection of AI, medicine, and biomedical engineering.

<title>HiFi-Mamba: Dual-Stream W-Laplacian Enhanced Mamba for High-Fidelity MRI Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data remains a challenging problem in MRI. While Mamba variants for vision tasks offer promising long-range modeling capabilities with linear-time complexity, their direct application to MRI reconstruction inherits two key limitations: (1) insensitivity to high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) reliance on redundant multi-directional scanning. To address these limitations, we introduce High-Fidelity Mamba (HiFi-Mamba), a novel dual-stream Mamba-based architecture comprising stacked W-Laplacian (WL) and HiFi-Mamba blocks. Specifically, the WL block performs fidelity-preserving spectral decoupling, producing complementary low- and high-frequency streams. This separation enables the HiFi-Mamba block to focus on low-frequency structures, enhancing global feature modeling. Concurrently, the HiFi-Mamba block selectively integrates high-frequency features through adaptive state-space modulation, preserving comprehensive spectral details. To eliminate the scanning redundancy, the HiFi-Mamba block adopts a streamlined unidirectional traversal strategy that preserves long-range modeling capability with improved computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard MRI reconstruction benchmarks demonstrate that HiFi-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based, Transformer-based, and other Mamba-based models in reconstruction accuracy while maintaining a compact and efficient model design.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integration of information across various data modalities, such as clinical time-series, medical images and textual reports. Compared to other domains, real-world medical data is heterogeneous in nature, limited in size, and sparse due to missing modalities. This significantly limits model performance in clinical prediction tasks. Inspired by clinical workflows, we introduce MedPatch, a multi-stage multimodal fusion architecture, which seamlessly integrates multiple modalities via confidence-guided patching. MedPatch comprises three main components: (i) a multi-stage fusion strategy that leverages joint and late fusion simultaneously, (ii) a missingness-aware module that handles sparse samples with missing modalities, (iii) a joint fusion module that clusters latent token patches based on calibrated unimodal token-level confidence. We evaluated MedPatch using real-world data consisting of clinical time-series data, chest X-ray images, radiology reports, and discharge notes extracted from the MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR, and MIMIC-Notes datasets on two benchmark tasks, namely in-hospital mortality prediction and clinical condition classification. Compared to existing baselines, MedPatch achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our work highlights the effectiveness of confidence-guided multi-stage fusion in addressing the heterogeneity of multimodal data, and establishes new state-of-the-art benchmark results for clinical prediction tasks.

Abstract: Colonoscopy is still the main method of detection and segmentation of colonic polyps, and recent advancements in deep learning networks such as U-Net, ResUNet, Swin-UNet, and PraNet have made outstanding performance in polyp segmentation. Yet, the problem is extremely challenging due to high variation in size, shape, endoscopy types, lighting, imaging protocols, and ill-defined boundaries (fluid, folds) of the polyps, rendering accurate segmentation a challenging and problematic task. To address these critical challenges in polyp segmentation, we introduce a hybrid (Transformer + CNN) model that is crafted to enhance robustness against evolving polyp characteristics. Our hybrid architecture demonstrates superior performance over existing solutions, particularly in addressing two critical challenges: (1) accurate segmentation of polyps with ill-defined margins through boundary-aware attention mechanisms, and (2) robust feature extraction in the presence of common endoscopic artifacts, including specular highlights, motion blur, and fluid occlusions. Quantitative evaluations reveal significant improvements in segmentation accuracy (Recall improved by 1.76%, i.e., 0.9555, accuracy improved by 0.07%, i.e., 0.9849) and artifact resilience compared to state-of-the-art polyp segmentation methods.

Abstract: The use of diverse modalities, such as omics, medical images, and clinical data can not only improve the performance of prognostic models but also deepen an understanding of disease mechanisms and facilitate the development of novel treatment approaches. However, medical data are complex, often incomplete, and contains missing modalities, making effective handling its crucial for training multimodal models. We introduce impuTMAE, a novel transformer-based end-to-end approach with an efficient multimodal pre-training strategy. It learns inter- and intra-modal interactions while simultaneously imputing missing modalities by reconstructing masked patches. Our model is pre-trained on heterogeneous, incomplete data and fine-tuned for glioma survival prediction using TCGA-GBM/LGG and BraTS datasets, integrating five modalities: genetic (DNAm, RNA-seq), imaging (MRI, WSI), and clinical data. By addressing missing data during pre-training and enabling efficient resource utilization, impuTMAE surpasses prior multimodal approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in glioma patient survival prediction.

Abstract: Different CT segmentation datasets are typically obtained from different scanners under different capture settings and often provide segmentation labels for a limited and often disjoint set of organs. Using these heterogeneous data effectively while preserving patient privacy can be challenging. This work presents a novel federated learning approach to achieve universal segmentation across diverse abdominal CT datasets by utilizing model uncertainty for aggregation and predictive uncertainty for inference. Our approach leverages the inherent noise in stochastic mini-batch gradient descent to estimate a distribution over the model weights to provide an on-the-go uncertainty over the model parameters at the client level. The parameters are then aggregated at the server using the additional uncertainty information using a Bayesian-inspired inverse-variance aggregation scheme. Furthermore, the proposed method quantifies prediction uncertainty by propagating the uncertainty from the model weights, providing confidence measures essential for clinical decision-making. In line with recent work shown, predictive uncertainty is utilized in the inference stage to improve predictive performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in improving both the quality of federated aggregation and uncertainty-weighted inference compared to previously established baselines.

Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of applying zero-shot self-supervised learning reconstruction to reduce breath-hold times in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Methods: Breath-hold MRCP was acquired from 11 healthy volunteers on a 3T scanner using an incoherent k-space sampling pattern leading to a breath-hold duration of 14s. We evaluated zero-shot reconstruction of breath-hold MRCP against parallel imaging of respiratory-triggered MRCP acquired in 338s on average and compressed sensing reconstruction of breath-hold MRCP. To address the long computation times of zero-shot trainings, we used a training approach that leverages a pretrained network to reduce backpropagation depth during training. Results: Zero-shot learning reconstruction significantly improved visual image quality compared to compressed sensing reconstruction, particularly in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and ductal delineation, and reached a level of quality comparable to that of successful respiratory-triggered acquisitions with regular breathing patterns. Shallow training provided nearly equivalent reconstruction performance with a training time of 11 minutes in comparison to 271 minutes for a conventional zero-shot training. Conclusion: Zero-shot learning delivers high-fidelity MRCP reconstructions with reduced breath-hold times, and shallow training offers a practical solution for translation to time-constrained clinical workflows.

<title>Learning to Detect Unknown Jailbreak Attacks in Large Vision-Language Models: A Unified and Accurate Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09201</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. Although recent detection works have shifted to internal representations due to their rich cross-modal information, most methods rely on heuristic rules rather than principled objectives, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a novel unsupervised framework that formulates jailbreak detection as anomaly detection. LoD introduces two key components: Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors (MSCAV), which capture layer-wise safety-related representations across modalities, and the Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder, which models the distribution of MSCAV derived from safe inputs and detects anomalies via reconstruction errors. By training the auto-encoder (AE) solely on safe samples without attack labels, LoD naturally identifies jailbreak inputs as distributional anomalies, enabling accurate and unified detection of jailbreak attacks. Comprehensive experiments on three different LVLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate that LoD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average AUROC of 0.9951 and an improvement of up to 38.89% in the minimum AUROC over the strongest baselines.

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models. We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

<title>From Explainable to Explained AI: Ideas for Falsifying and Quantifying Explanations</title>

Abstract: Explaining deep learning models is essential for clinical integration of medical image analysis systems. A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations. This offers a practical path from explainable AI to explained AI in digital pathology and beyond. Code and prompts are available at https://github.com/nki-ai/x2x.

Abstract: While analysing rare blood cell aggregates remains challenging in automated haematology, they could markedly advance label-free functional diagnostics. Conventional flow cytometers efficiently perform cell counting with leukocyte differentials but fail to identify aggregates with flagged results, requiring manual reviews. Quantitative phase imaging flow cytometry captures detailed aggregate morphologies, but clinical use is hampered by massive data storage and offline processing. Incorporating hidden biomarkers into routine haematology panels would significantly improve diagnostics without flagged results. We present RT-HAD, an end-to-end deep learning-based image and data processing framework for off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM), which combines physics-consistent holographic reconstruction and detection, representing each blood cell in a graph to recognize aggregates. RT-HAD processes >30 GB of image data on-the-fly with turnaround time of <1.5 min and error rate of 8.9% in platelet aggregate detection, which matches acceptable laboratory error rates of haematology biomarkers and solves the big data challenge for point-of-care diagnostics.

Abstract: Mammography report generation is a critical yet underexplored task in medical AI, characterized by challenges such as multiview image reasoning, high-resolution visual cues, and unstructured radiologic language. In this work, we introduce AMRG (Automatic Mammography Report Generation), the first end-to-end framework for generating narrative mammography reports using large vision-language models (VLMs). Building upon MedGemma-4B-it-a domain-specialized, instruction-tuned VLM-we employ a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling lightweight adaptation with minimal computational overhead. We train and evaluate AMRG on DMID, a publicly available dataset of paired high-resolution mammograms and diagnostic reports. This work establishes the first reproducible benchmark for mammography report generation, addressing a longstanding gap in multimodal clinical AI. We systematically explore LoRA hyperparameter configurations and conduct comparative experiments across multiple VLM backbones, including both domain-specific and general-purpose models under a unified tuning protocol. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across both language generation and clinical metrics, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.5691, METEOR of 0.6152, CIDEr of 0.5818, and BI-RADS accuracy of 0.5582. Qualitative analysis further highlights improved diagnostic consistency and reduced hallucinations. AMRG offers a scalable and adaptable foundation for radiology report generation and paves the way for future research in multimodal medical AI.

Abstract: Survival analysis utilizing multiple longitudinal medical images plays a pivotal role in the early detection and prognosis of diseases by providing insight beyond single-image evaluations. However, current methodologies often inadequately utilize censored data, overlook correlations among longitudinal images measured over multiple time points, and lack interpretability. We introduce SurLonFormer, a novel Transformer-based neural network that integrates longitudinal medical imaging with structured data for survival prediction. Our architecture comprises three key components: a Vision Encoder for extracting spatial features, a Sequence Encoder for aggregating temporal information, and a Survival Encoder based on the Cox proportional hazards model. This framework effectively incorporates censored data, addresses scalability issues, and enhances interpretability through occlusion sensitivity analysis and dynamic survival prediction. Extensive simulations and a real-world application in Alzheimer's disease analysis demonstrate that SurLonFormer achieves superior predictive performance and successfully identifies disease-related imaging biomarkers.

<title>DAgger Diffusion Navigation: DAgger Boosted Diffusion Policy for Vision-Language Navigation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09444</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces. Existing VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning framework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable waypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the high-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework suffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each stage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the quality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations, we propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE policy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and planning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional diffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future actions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint predictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible instruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in imitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation tasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory augmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This approach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to recover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based models in terms of navigation performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Tokishx/DifNav.

<title>Combating Noisy Labels via Dynamic Connection Masking</title>

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code will soon be publicly available.

Abstract: Existing video recommender systems rely primarily on user-defined metadata or on low-level visual and acoustic signals extracted by specialised encoders. These low-level features describe what appears on the screen but miss deeper semantics such as intent, humour, and world knowledge that make clips resonate with viewers. For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or an ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such distinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible to traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple, recommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects high-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip into a rich natural-language description (e.g. "a superhero parody with slapstick fights and orchestral stabs"), bridging the gap between raw content and user intent. We use MLLM output with a state-of-the-art text encoder and feed it into standard collaborative, content-based, and generative recommenders. On the MicroLens-100K dataset, which emulates user interactions with TikTok-style videos, our framework consistently surpasses conventional video, audio, and metadata features in five representative models. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging MLLMs as on-the-fly knowledge extractors to build more intent-aware video recommenders.

Abstract: Astronomical surveys and the growing involvement of amateur astronomers are producing more sky images than ever before, and this calls for automated processing methods that are accurate and robust. Detecting Deep Sky Objects -- such as galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters -- remains challenging because of their faint signals and complex backgrounds. Advances in Computer Vision and Deep Learning now make it possible to improve and automate this process. In this paper, we present the training and comparison of different detection models (YOLO, RET-DETR) on smart telescope images, using High-Performance Computing (HPC) to parallelise computations, in particular for robustness testing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered impressive results in language understanding, generation, reasoning, and pushes the ability boundary of multimodal models. Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer a strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In this survey, we offer a systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency. Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally, we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey presents a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI systems.

Abstract: Neurological conditions affecting visual perception create profound experiential divides between affected individuals and their caregivers, families, and medical professionals. We present the Perceptual Reality Transformer, a comprehensive framework employing six distinct neural architectures to simulate eight neurological perception conditions with scientifically-grounded visual transformations. Our system learns mappings from natural images to condition-specific perceptual states, enabling others to experience approximations of simultanagnosia, prosopagnosia, ADHD attention deficits, visual agnosia, depression-related changes, anxiety tunnel vision, and Alzheimer's memory effects. Through systematic evaluation across ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures achieve optimal performance, outperforming traditional CNN and generative approaches. Our work establishes the first systematic benchmark for neurological perception simulation, contributes novel condition-specific perturbation functions grounded in clinical literature, and provides quantitative metrics for evaluating simulation fidelity. The framework has immediate applications in medical education, empathy training, and assistive technology development, while advancing our fundamental understanding of how neural networks can model atypical human perception.

<title>Toward Human-Robot Teaming: Learning Handover Behaviors from 3D Scenes</title>

Abstract: Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human and robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such as human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies, focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a leading modality for the diagnosis of liver cancer, significantly improving the classification of the lesion and patient outcomes. However, traditional MRI faces challenges including risks from contrast agent (CA) administration, time-consuming manual assessment, and limited annotated datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a Time-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for synthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from non-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a conditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and temporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic time-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase information flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth and physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a constraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion classification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further enhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent liver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework offers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional contrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and reliability for the assessment of liver lesion. The implementation of T-CACE is publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/T-CACE.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced the integration of visual and textual understanding. However, their ability to generate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we introduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and coding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation abilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary models like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging strategy and new datasets.

Abstract: The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision models, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications. Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time optimization at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Thanks to the large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, we can craft a zero-shot classifier by "prompt", e.g., the confidence score of an image being "[CLASS]" can be obtained by using the VLM provided similarity measure between the image and the prompt sentence "a photo of a [CLASS]". Therefore, prompt shows a great potential for fast adaptation of VLMs to downstream tasks if we fine-tune the prompt-based similarity measure. However, we find a common failure that improper fine-tuning may not only undermine the prompt's inherent prediction for the task-related classes, but also for other classes in the VLM vocabulary. Existing methods still address this problem by using traditional anti-overfitting techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation, which lack a principled solution specific to prompt. We present Prompt-aligned Gradient, dubbed ProGrad, to prevent prompt tuning from forgetting the the general knowledge learned from VLMs. In particular, ProGrad only updates the prompt whose gradient is aligned (or non-conflicting) to the "general direction", which is represented as the gradient of the KL loss of the pre-defined prompt prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the stronger few-shot generalization ability of ProGrad over state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/BeierZhu/Prompt-align.

Abstract: We present a new paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale visionlanguage pre-trained models on downstream task, dubbed Prompt Regularization (ProReg). Different from traditional fine-tuning which easily overfits to the downstream task data, ProReg uses the prediction by prompting the pretrained model to regularize the fine-tuning. The motivation is: by prompting the large model "a photo of a [CLASS]", the fil-lin answer is only dependent on the pretraining encyclopedic knowledge while independent of the task data distribution, which is usually biased. Specifically, given a training sample prediction during fine-tuning, we first calculate its KullbackLeibler loss of the prompt prediction and Cross-Entropy loss of the ground-truth label, and then combine them with a proposed sample-wise adaptive trade-off weight, which automatically adjusts the transfer between the pretrained and downstream domains. On various out-of-distribution benchmarks, we show the consistently strong performance of ProReg compared with conventional fine-tuning, zero-shot prompt, prompt tuning, and other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection systems for ear diseases, powered by deep learning, are essential for preventing hearing impairment and improving population health. However, the limited diversity of existing otoendoscopy datasets and the poor balance between diagnostic accuracy, computational efficiency, and model size have hindered the translation of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms into healthcare applications. In this study, we constructed a large-scale, multi-center otoendoscopy dataset covering eight common ear diseases and healthy cases. Building upon this resource, we developed Best-EarNet, an ultrafast and lightweight deep learning architecture integrating a novel Local-Global Spatial Feature Fusion Module with a multi-scale supervision strategy, enabling real-time and accurate classification of ear conditions. Leveraging transfer learning, Best-EarNet, with a model size of only 2.94 MB, achieved diagnostic accuracies of 95.23% on an internal test set (22,581 images) and 92.14% on an external test set (1,652 images), while requiring only 0.0125 seconds (80 frames per second) to process a single image on a standard CPU. Further subgroup analysis by gender and age showed consistently excellent performance of Best-EarNet across all demographic groups. To enhance clinical interpretability and user trust, we incorporated Grad-CAM-based visualization, highlighting the specific abnormal ear regions contributing to AI predictions. Most importantly, we developed Ear-Keeper, a cross-platform intelligent diagnosis system built upon Best-EarNet, deployable on smartphones, tablets, and personal computers. Ear-Keeper enables public users and healthcare providers to perform comprehensive real-time video-based ear canal screening, supporting early detection and timely intervention of ear diseases.

Abstract: In IoT based distributed network of cameras, real-time multi-camera video analytics is challenged by high bandwidth demands and redundant visual data, creating a fundamental tension where reducing data saves network overhead but can degrade model performance, and vice versa. We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.

Struggle detection, as defined in this paper, is a distinct and important task that can be identified without explicit step or activity knowledge. We introduce the first struggle dataset with three real-world problem-solving activities that are labelled by both expert and crowd-source annotators. Video segments were scored w.r.t. their level of struggle using a forced choice 4-point scale. This dataset contains 5.1 hours of video from 73 participants. We conducted a series of experiments to identify the most suitable modelling approaches for struggle determination. Additionally, we compared various deep learning models, establishing baseline results for struggle classification, struggle regression, and struggle label distribution learning. Our results indicate that struggle detection in video can achieve up to $88.24\%$ accuracy in binary classification, while detecting the level of struggle in a four-way classification setting performs lower, with an overall accuracy of $52.45\%$. Our work is motivated toward a more comprehensive understanding of action in video and potentially the improvement of assistive systems that analyse struggle and can better support users during manual activities.

Abstract: Scribble supervision has emerged as a promising approach for reducing annotation costs in medical 3D segmentation by leveraging sparse annotations instead of voxel-wise labels. While existing methods report strong performance, a closer analysis reveals that the majority of research is confined to the cardiac domain, predominantly using ACDC and MSCMR datasets. This over-specialization has resulted in severe overfitting, misleading claims of performance improvements, and a lack of generalization across broader segmentation tasks. In this work, we formulate a set of key requirements for practical scribble supervision and introduce ScribbleBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning over seven diverse medical imaging datasets, to systematically evaluate the fulfillment of these requirements. Consequently, we uncover a general failure of methods to generalize across tasks and that many widely used novelties degrade performance outside of the cardiac domain, whereas simpler overlooked approaches achieve superior generalization. Finally, we raise awareness for a strong yet overlooked baseline, nnU-Net coupled with a partial loss, which consistently outperforms specialized methods across a diverse range of tasks. By identifying fundamental limitations in existing research and establishing a new benchmark-driven evaluation standard, this work aims to steer scribble supervision toward more practical, robust, and generalizable methodologies for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is a non-intrusive privacy and relatively convenient and inexpensive device, which has been demonstrated to be applicable in place of RGB cameras in human indoor pose estimation tasks. However, mmWave radar relies on the collection of reflected signals from the target, and the radar signals containing information is difficult to be fully applied. This has been a long-standing hindrance to the improvement of pose estimation accuracy. To address this major challenge, this paper introduces a probability map guided multi-format feature fusion model, ProbRadarM3F. This is a novel radar feature extraction framework using a traditional FFT method in parallel with a probability map based positional encoding method. ProbRadarM3F fuses the traditional heatmap features and the positional features, then effectively achieves the estimation of 14 keypoints of the human body. Experimental evaluation on the HuPR dataset proves the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper, outperforming other methods experimented on this dataset with an AP of 69.9 %. The emphasis of our study is focusing on the position information that is not exploited before in radar singal. This provides direction to investigate other potential non-redundant information from mmWave rader.

Abstract: Video processing is generally divided into two main categories: processing of the entire video, which typically yields optimal classification outcomes, and real-time processing, where the objective is to make a decision as promptly as possible. Although the models dedicated to the processing of entire videos are typically well-defined and clearly presented in the literature, this is not the case for online processing, where a~plethora of hand-devised methods exist. To address this issue, we present PrAViC, a novel, unified, and theoretically-based adaptation framework for tackling the online classification problem in video data. The initial phase of our study is to establish a mathematical background for the classification of sequential data, with the potential to make a decision at an early stage. This allows us to construct a natural function that encourages the model to return a result much faster. The subsequent phase is to present a straightforward and readily implementable method for adapting offline models to the online setting using recurrent operations. Finally, PrAViC is evaluated by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art offline and online models and datasets. This enables the network to significantly reduce the time required to reach classification decisions while maintaining, or even enhancing, accuracy.

<title>Integrating Clinical Knowledge Graphs and Gradient-Based Neural Systems for Enhanced Melanoma Diagnosis via the 7-Point Checklist</title>

Abstract: The 7-point checklist (7PCL) is a widely used diagnostic tool in dermoscopy for identifying malignant melanoma by assigning point values to seven specific attributes. However, the traditional 7PCL is limited to distinguishing between malignant melanoma and melanocytic Nevi, and falls short in scenarios where multiple skin diseases with appearances similar to melanoma coexist. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diagnostic framework that integrates a clinical knowledge-based topological graph (CKTG) with a gradient diagnostic strategy featuring a data-driven weighting system (GD-DDW). The CKTG captures both the internal and external relationships among the 7PCL attributes, while the GD-DDW emulates dermatologists' diagnostic processes, prioritizing visual observation before making predictions. Additionally, we introduce a multimodal feature extraction approach leveraging a dual-attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction through cross-modal interaction and unimodal collaboration. This method incorporates meta-information to uncover interactions between clinical data and image features, ensuring more accurate and robust predictions. Our approach, evaluated on the EDRA dataset, achieved an average AUC of 88.6%, demonstrating superior performance in melanoma detection and feature prediction. This integrated system provides data-driven benchmarks for clinicians, significantly enhancing the precision of melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is hard, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build on well-established components to construct a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in "stone" weights.

Abstract: Foundation models have triggered a paradigm shift in computer vision and are increasingly being adopted in remote sensing, particularly for multispectral imagery. Yet, their potential in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) remains untapped due to the absence of comprehensive and globally representative hyperspectral datasets. To close this gap, we introduce SpectralEarth, a large-scale multitemporal dataset designed to pretrain hyperspectral foundation models leveraging data from the environmental mapping and analysis program (EnMAP). SpectralEarth comprises 538 974 image patches covering 415 153 unique locations from 11 636 globally distributed EnMAP scenes spanning two years of archive. In addition, 17.5% of these locations include multiple timestamps, enabling multitemporal HSI analysis. Utilizing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning algorithms, we pretrain a series of foundation models on SpectralEarth, integrating a spectral adapter into classical vision backbones to accommodate the unique characteristics of HSI. In tandem, we construct nine downstream datasets for land-cover, crop-type mapping, and tree-species classification, providing benchmarks for model evaluation. Experimental results support the versatility of our models and their generalizability across different tasks and sensors. We also highlight computational efficiency during model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation methods have shown promising results in medical image segmentation, significantly reducing annotation costs. However, existing approaches often rely on auxiliary tasks to enforce semantic consistency and use hard pseudo labels for supervision, overlooking the unique challenges faced by models trained with sparse annotations. These models must predict pixel-wise segmentation maps from limited data, making it crucial to handle varying levels of annotation richness effectively. In this paper, we propose MaCo, a weakly supervised model designed for medical image segmentation, based on the principle of "from few to more." MaCo leverages Masked Context Modeling (MCM) and Continuous Pseudo Labels (CPL). MCM employs an attention-based masking strategy to perturb the input image, ensuring that the model's predictions align with those of the original image. CPL converts scribble annotations into continuous pixel-wise labels by applying an exponential decay function to distance maps, producing confidence maps that represent the likelihood of each pixel belonging to a specific category, rather than relying on hard pseudo labels. We evaluate MaCo on three public datasets, comparing it with other weakly supervised methods. Our results show that MaCo outperforms competing methods across all datasets, establishing a new record in weakly supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Dual encoder architectures like Clip models map two types of inputs into a shared embedding space and predict similarities between them. Despite their wide application, it is, however, not understood how these models compare their two inputs. Common first-order feature-attribution methods explain importances of individual features and can, thus, only provide limited insights into dual encoders, whose predictions depend on interactions between features. In this paper, we first derive a second-order method enabling the attribution of predictions by any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to Clip models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes and also account for mismatches. This intrinsic visual-linguistic grounding ability, however, varies heavily between object classes, exhibits pronounced out-of-domain effects and we can identify individual errors as well as systematic failure categories.

Abstract: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and young adults, but the scarcity of large histopathology datasets has limited the application of computational pathology in this group. This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often face a modality representation gap during pretraining: while language embeddings remain stable, visual representations are highly sensitive to contextual noise (e.g., background clutter). To address this issue, we introduce a visual comprehension stage, which we call ViCToR (Visual Comprehension via Token Reconstruction), a novel pretraining framework for LMMs. ViCToR employs a learnable visual token pool and utilizes the Hungarian matching algorithm to select semantically relevant tokens from this pool for visual token replacement. Furthermore, by integrating a visual token reconstruction loss with dense semantic supervision, ViCToR can learn tokens which retain high visual detail, thereby enhancing the large language model's (LLM's) understanding of visual information. After pretraining on 3 million publicly accessible images and captions, ViCToR achieves state-of-the-art results, improving over LLaVA-NeXT-8B by 10.4%, 3.2%, and 7.2% on the MMStar, SEED$^I$, and RealWorldQA benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Existing unsupervised keypoint detection methods apply artificial deformations to images such as masking a significant portion of images and using reconstruction of original image as a learning objective to detect keypoints. However, this approach lacks depth information in the image and often detects keypoints on the background. To address this, we propose Distill-DKP, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages depth maps and RGB images for keypoint detection in a self-supervised setting. During training, Distill-DKP extracts embedding-level knowledge from a depth-based teacher model to guide an image-based student model with inference restricted to the student. Experiments show that Distill-DKP significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods by reducing mean L2 error by 47.15% on Human3.6M, mean average error by 5.67% on Taichi, and improving keypoints accuracy by 1.3% on DeepFashion dataset. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate the sensitivity of knowledge distillation across different layers of the network. Project Page: https://23wm13.github.io/distill-dkp/

Abstract: Outdoor images often suffer from severe degradation due to rain, haze, and noise, impairing image quality and challenging high-level tasks. Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks. The source code will be available at https://github.com/House-yuyu/MDDA-former.

Abstract: We introduce a generalized framework for Scene Change Detection (SCD) that addresses the core ambiguity of distinguishing "relevant" from "nuisance" changes, enabling effective joint training of a single model across diverse domains and applications. Existing methods struggle to generalize due to differences in dataset labeling, where changes such as vegetation growth or lane marking alterations may be labeled as relevant in one dataset and irrelevant in another. To resolve this ambiguity, we propose ViewDelta, a text conditioned change detection framework that uses natural language prompts to define relevant changes precisely, such as a single attribute, a specific set of classes, or all observable differences. To facilitate training in this paradigm, we release the Conditional Change Segmentation dataset (CSeg), the first large-scale synthetic dataset for text conditioned SCD, consisting of over 500,000 image pairs with more than 300,000 unique textual prompts describing relevant changes. Experiments demonstrate that a single ViewDelta model trained jointly on CSeg, SYSU-CD, PSCD, VL-CMU-CD, and their unaligned variants achieves performance competitive with or superior to dataset specific models, highlighting text conditioning as a powerful approach for generalizable SCD. Our code and dataset are available at https://joshuakgao.github.io/viewdelta/.

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation has great potential in autonomous driving and robotics due to the advantages of event cameras, such as high dynamic range, low latency, and low power cost. Unfortunately, current artificial neural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational demands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption, limiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile platforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven lightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature interaction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with binary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS inference speed. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/longxianlei/SLTNet-v1.0.

Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulators solve the wave equation to model pressure distribution fields, achieving high accuracy but requiring significant computational time and resources. To address this, ray tracing approaches have been introduced, modeling wave propagation as rays interacting with boundaries and scatterers. However, existing models simplify ray propagation, generating echoes at interaction points without considering return paths to the sensor. This can result in unrealistic artifacts and necessitates careful scene tuning for plausible results. We propose a novel ultrasound simulation pipeline that utilizes a ray tracing algorithm to generate echo data, tracing each ray from the transducer through the scene and back to the sensor. To replicate advanced ultrasound imaging, we introduce a ray emission scheme optimized for plane wave imaging, incorporating delay and steering capabilities. Furthermore, we integrate a standard signal processing pipeline to simulate end-to-end ultrasound image formation. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed pipeline by modeling synthetic scenes featuring highly reflective objects, such as bones. In doing so, our proposed approach, UltraRay, not only enhances the overall visual quality but also improves the realism of the simulated images by accurately capturing secondary reflections and reducing unnatural artifacts. By building on top of a differentiable framework, the proposed pipeline lays the groundwork for a fast and differentiable ultrasound simulation tool necessary for gradient-based optimization, enabling advanced ultrasound beamforming strategies, neural network integration, and accurate inverse scene reconstruction.

Abstract: From a simple text prompt, generative-AI image models can create stunningly realistic and creative images bounded, it seems, by only our imagination. These models have achieved this remarkable feat thanks, in part, to the ingestion of billions of images collected from nearly every corner of the internet. Many creators have understandably expressed concern over how their intellectual property has been ingested without their permission or a mechanism to opt out of training. As a result, questions of fair use and copyright infringement have quickly emerged. We describe a method that allows us to determine if a model was trained on a specific image or set of images. This method is computationally efficient and assumes no explicit knowledge of the model architecture or weights (so-called black-box membership inference). We anticipate that this method will be crucial for auditing existing models and, looking ahead, ensuring the fairer development and deployment of generative AI models.

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have become essential for autonomous driving by enabling future scene prediction. However, existing DWMs are limited to scene generation and fail to incorporate scene understanding, which involves interpreting and reasoning about the driving environment. In this paper, we present a unified Driving World Model named HERMES. We seamlessly integrate 3D scene understanding and future scene evolution (generation) through a unified framework in driving scenarios. Specifically, HERMES leverages a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation to consolidate multi-view spatial information while preserving geometric relationships and interactions. We also introduce world queries, which incorporate world knowledge into BEV features via causal attention in the Large Language Model, enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive studies on nuScenes and OmniDrive-nuScenes datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing generation error by 32.4% and improving understanding metrics such as CIDEr by 8.0%. The model and code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMD0311/HERMES.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) measures and predicts perceived image quality by human observers. Although recent studies have highlighted the critical influence that variations in the scale of an image have on its perceived quality, this relationship has not been systematically quantified. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Image Intrinsic Scale (IIS), defined as the largest scale where an image exhibits its highest perceived quality. We also present the Image Intrinsic Scale Assessment (IISA) task, which involves subjectively measuring and predicting the IIS based on human judgments. We develop a subjective annotation methodology and create the IISA-DB dataset, comprising 785 image-IIS pairs annotated by experts in a rigorously controlled crowdsourcing study. Furthermore, we propose WIISA (Weak-labeling for Image Intrinsic Scale Assessment), a strategy that leverages how the IIS of an image varies with downscaling to generate weak labels. Experiments show that applying WIISA during the training of several IQA methods adapted for IISA consistently improves the performance compared to using only ground-truth labels. The code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/SonyResearch/IISA.

However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.

Abstract: Styled motion in-betweening is crucial for computer animation and gaming. However, existing methods typically encode motion styles by modeling whole-body motions, often overlooking the representation of individual body parts. This limitation reduces the flexibility of infilled motion, particularly in adjusting the motion styles of specific limbs independently. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework that models motion styles at the body-part level, enhancing both the diversity and controllability of infilled motions. Our approach enables more nuanced and expressive animations by allowing precise modifications to individual limb motions while maintaining overall motion coherence. Leveraging phase-related insights, our framework employs periodic autoencoders to automatically extract the phase of each body part, capturing distinctive local style features. Additionally, we effectively decouple the motion source from synthesis control by integrating motion manifold learning and conditional generation techniques from both image and motion domains. This allows the motion source to generate high-quality motions across various styles, with extracted motion and style features readily available for controlled synthesis in subsequent tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior speed, robust generalization, and effective generation of extended motion sequences.

<title>GranQ: Granular Zero-Shot Quantization with Channel-Wise Activation Scaling in QAT</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization (ZSQ) enables neural network compression without original training data, making it a promising solution for restricted data access scenarios. To compensate for the lack of data, recent ZSQ methods typically rely on synthetic inputs generated from the full-precision model. However, these synthetic inputs often lead to activation distortion, especially under low-bit settings. To mitigate this, existing methods typically employ per-channel scaling, but they still struggle due to the severe computational overhead during the accumulation process. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we propose GranQ, a novel activation quantization framework that introduces an efficient pre-scaling strategy. Unlike conventional channel-wise methods that repeatedly perform scaling operations during accumulation, GranQ applies scaling factors in a pre-scaling step through fully vectorized computation, eliminating runtime scaling overhead. This design enables GranQ to maintain fine-grained quantization accuracy while significantly reducing computational burden, particularly in low-bit quantization settings. Extensive experiments under quantization-aware training (QAT) settings demonstrate that GranQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ZSQ methods across CIFAR and ImageNet. In particular, our method achieves up to 5.45% higher accuracy in the 3-bit setting on CIFAR-100 and even surpasses the full-precision baseline on CIFAR-10. Furthermore, GranQ achieves significant speedup in quantization latency over conventional per-channel methods, demonstrating improved efficiency. With these findings, we anticipate that GranQ will inspire future research beyond conventional ZSQ approaches centered on data generation and model fine-tuning. The official code is available at https://github.com/anonymus-orange/GranQ.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have highlighted their potential for multi-modal understanding, yet evaluating their factual grounding in videos remains a critical unsolved challenge. To address this gap, we introduce Video SimpleQA, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for factuality evaluation in video contexts. Our work differs from existing video benchmarks through the following key features: 1) Knowledge required: demanding integration of external knowledge beyond the video's explicit narrative; 2) Multi-hop fact-seeking question: Each question involves multiple explicit facts and requires strict factual grounding without hypothetical or subjective inferences. We also include per-hop single-fact-based sub-QAs alongside final QAs to enable fine-grained, stepby-step evaluation; 3) Short-form definitive answer: Answers are crafted as unambiguous and definitively correct in a short format with minimal scoring variance; 4) Temporal grounded required: Requiring answers to rely on one or more temporal segments in videos, rather than single frames. We extensively evaluate 33 state-of-the-art LVLMs and summarize key findings as follows: 1) Current LVLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in factual adherence, with the best-performing model o3 merely achieving an F-score of 66.3%; 2) Most LVLMs are overconfident in what they generate, with self-stated confidence exceeding actual accuracy; 3) Retrieval-augmented generation demonstrates consistent improvements at the cost of additional inference time overhead; 4) Multi-hop QA demonstrates substantially degraded performance compared to single-hop sub-QAs, with first-hop object or event recognition emerging as the primary bottleneck. We position Video SimpleQA as the cornerstone benchmark for video factuality assessment, aiming to steer LVLM development toward verifiable grounding in real-world contexts.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves impressive quality and rendering speed, but with millions of 3D Gaussians and significant storage and transmission costs. In this paper, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method called NeuralGS that compresses the original 3DGS into a compact representation. Our observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes. Thus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even for a large-scale scene. To achieve this, we adopt a clustering strategy and fit the Gaussians within each cluster using different tiny MLPs, based on importance scores of Gaussians as fitting weights. We experiment on multiple datasets, achieving a 91-times average model size reduction without harming the visual quality.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of 3D generation, achieving controllability, i.e., ensuring consistency between generated 3D content and input conditions like edge and depth, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often struggle to maintain accurate alignment, leading to noticeable discrepancies. To address this issue, we propose \name{}, a new framework that enhances controllable 3D generation by explicitly encouraging cyclic consistency between the second-order 3D content, generated based on extracted signals from the first-order generation, and its original input controls. Specifically, we employ an efficient feed-forward backbone that can generate a 3D object from an input condition and a text prompt. Given an initial viewpoint and a control signal, a novel view is rendered from the generated 3D content, from which the extracted condition is used to regenerate the 3D content. This re-generated output is then rendered back to the initial viewpoint, followed by another round of control signal extraction, forming a cyclic process with two consistency constraints. \emph{View consistency} ensures coherence between the two generated 3D objects, measured by semantic similarity to accommodate generative diversity. \emph{Condition consistency} aligns the final extracted signal with the original input control, preserving structural or geometric details throughout the process. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that \name{} significantly improves controllability, especially for fine-grained details, outperforming existing methods across various conditions (e.g., +14.17\% PSNR for edge, +6.26\% PSNR for sketch).

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS) remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding, and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one private farmland plot dataset, containing 27,247 QA pairs and 19,615 images. The pipeline begins with multi-source data pre-processing, including collection, format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 20 open-source LMMs and 4 closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical challenges for future work.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within image generation via the transformer architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global modeling transformers, which face significant quadratic computational cost. However, through empirical analysis, we find that DiTs do not rely as heavily on global information as previously believed. In fact, most layers exhibit significant redundancy in global computation. Additionally, conventional attention mechanisms suffer from low-frequency inertia, limiting their efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Pseudo Shifted Window Attention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global attention redundancy. PSWA achieves moderate global-local information through window attention. It further utilizes a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, which both enrich the high-frequency information and strengthen inter-window connections. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation (PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention without additional computational cost. Based on these innovations, we propose a series of Pseudo Progressive Diffusion Transformer (PiT). Our extensive experiments show their superior performance; for example, our proposed PiT-L achieves 54% FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while using less computation.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to Transformer-based architectures, offering linear complexity in sequence length while maintaining strong modeling capacity. However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection, demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous Mamba-based backbones, with particularly notable gains under high-resolution settings.

Abstract: Synthetic X-ray angiographies generated by modern generative models hold great potential to reduce the use of contrast agents in vascular interventional procedures. However, low-quality synthetic angiographies can significantly increase procedural risk, underscoring the need for reliable image quality assessment (IQA) methods. Existing IQA models, however, fail to leverage auxiliary images as references during evaluation and lack fine-grained, task-specific metrics necessary for clinical relevance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CAS-IQA, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework that predicts fine-grained quality scores by effectively incorporating auxiliary information from related images. In the absence of angiography datasets, CAS-3K is constructed, comprising 3,565 synthetic angiographies along with score annotations. To ensure clinically meaningful assessment, three task-specific evaluation metrics are defined. Furthermore, a Multi-path featUre fuSion and rouTing (MUST) module is designed to enhance image representations by adaptively fusing and routing visual tokens to metric-specific branches. Extensive experiments on the CAS-3K dataset demonstrate that CAS-IQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA methods by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Human pose estimation based on Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a promising approach for non-intrusive and precise human activity monitoring, yet faces challenges including accurate multi-person pose recognition and effective CSI feature learning. This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion. Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we address Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation (SSS) under domain shift by leveraging domain-invariant semantic knowledge from text embeddings of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We propose a unified Hierarchical Vision-Language framework (HVL) that integrates domain-invariant text embeddings as object queries in a transformer-based segmentation network to improve generalization and reduce misclassification under limited supervision. The mentioned textual queries are used for grouping pixels with shared semantics under SSS. HVL is designed to (1) generate textual queries that maximally encode domain-invariant semantics from VLM while capturing intra-class variations; (2) align these queries with spatial visual features to enhance their segmentation ability and improve the semantic clarity of visual features. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision--language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic understanding. HVL establishes a novel state-of-the-art by achieving a +9.3% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on COCO, utilizing 232 labelled images, +3.1% on Pascal VOC employing 92 labels, +4.8% on ADE20 using 316 labels, and +3.4% on Cityscapes with 100 labels, demonstrating superior performance with less than 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets. Our results show that language-guided segmentation bridges the label efficiency gap and enables new levels of fine-grained generalization.

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However, conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP (OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all categories on SemanticKITTI.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking and GLM-4.5V, a family of vision-language models (VLMs) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks.

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available at:https://github.com/TRLou/PGA.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the need for expensive manual annotations. Intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and 3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available online.

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR) framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration, grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark. In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs, neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants, these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module, which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold, regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions, we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes, effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions, leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with environmental variability, occlusions, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes 20 corruption types based on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the HOI field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic and partial cues, thus dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection. Benchmarks, datasets, and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Kratos-Wen/RoHOI.

<title>Advancing Reliable Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models under Visual Variations</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under real-world distribution shifts. Code: https://github.com/Evelyn1ywliang/ReTA.

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions. Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution images through cropping, integrating local and global features for multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and 3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2) mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality, physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals, promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face similarity.

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths: monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision, while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce a unified framework that bridges both through iterative bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning. This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results: \textbf{it reduces zero-shot generalization error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view geometry with monocular context, our approach enables robust 3D perception that transcends modality-specific limitations.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate BRDF acquisition of real world materials is a challenging research problem that requires sampling millions of incident light and viewing directions. To accelerate the acquisition process, one needs to find a minimal set of sampling directions such that the recovery of the full BRDF is accurate and robust given such samples. In this paper, we formulate BRDF acquisition as a compressed sensing problem, where the sensing operator is one that performs sub-sampling of the BRDF signal according to a set of optimal sample directions. To solve this problem, we propose the Fast and Robust Optimal Sampling Technique (FROST) for designing a provably optimal sub-sampling operator that places light-view samples such that the recovery error is minimized. FROST casts the problem of designing an optimal sub-sampling operator for compressed sensing into a sparse representation formulation under the Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) signal model. The proposed reformulation is exact, i.e. without any approximations, hence it converts an intractable combinatorial problem into one that can be solved with standard optimization techniques. As a result, FROST is accompanied by strong theoretical guarantees from the field of compressed sensing. We perform a thorough analysis of FROST-BRDF using a 10-fold cross-validation with publicly available BRDF datasets and show significant advantages compared to the state-of-the-art with respect to reconstruction quality. Finally, FROST is simple, both conceptually and in terms of implementation, it produces consistent results at each run, and it is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the prior art.

Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Deep Learning enhances decision-making by integrating diverse information sources, such as texts, images, audio, and videos. To develop trustworthy multimodal approaches, it is essential to understand how uncertainty impacts these models. We propose LUMA, a unique multimodal dataset, featuring audio, image, and textual data from 50 classes, specifically designed for learning from uncertain data. It extends the well-known CIFAR 10/100 dataset with audio samples extracted from three audio corpora, and text data generated using the Gemma-7B Large Language Model (LLM). The LUMA dataset enables the controlled injection of varying types and degrees of uncertainty to achieve and tailor specific experiments and benchmarking initiatives. LUMA is also available as a Python package including the functions for generating multiple variants of the dataset with controlling the diversity of the data, the amount of noise for each modality, and adding out-of-distribution samples. A baseline pre-trained model is also provided alongside three uncertainty quantification methods: Monte-Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensemble, and Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning. This comprehensive dataset and its tools are intended to promote and support the development, evaluation, and benchmarking of trustworthy and robust multimodal deep learning approaches. We anticipate that the LUMA dataset will help the research community to design more trustworthy and robust machine learning approaches for safety critical applications. The code and instructions for downloading and processing the dataset can be found at: https://github.com/bezirganyan/LUMA/ .

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, which can be further augmented by integrating a pre-trained vision model into the original LLM to create a multimodal LLM (MLLM). However, this integration often significantly decreases performance on natural language understanding and generation tasks, compared to the original LLM. This study investigates this issue using the LLaVA MLLM, treating the integration as a continual learning problem. We evaluate five continual learning methods to mitigate forgetting and identify a technique that enhances visual understanding while minimizing linguistic performance loss. Our approach reduces linguistic performance degradation by up to 15% over the LLaVA recipe, while maintaining high multimodal accuracy. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method through continual learning on a sequence of vision-language tasks, effectively preserving linguistic skills while acquiring new multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have reached remarkable levels of proficiency in understanding multimodal inputs. However, understanding and interpreting the behavior of such complex models is a challenging task, not to mention the dynamic shifts that may occur during fine-tuning, or due to covariate shift between datasets. In this work, we apply concept-level analysis towards MLLM understanding. More specifically, we propose to map hidden states to interpretable visual and textual concepts. This enables us to more efficiently compare certain semantic dynamics, such as the shift from an original and fine-tuned model, revealing concept alteration and potential biases that may occur during fine-tuning. We also demonstrate the use of shift vectors to capture these concepts changes. These shift vectors allow us to recover fine-tuned concepts by applying simple, computationally inexpensive additive concept shifts in the original model. Finally, our findings also have direct applications for MLLM steering, which can be used for model debiasing as well as enforcing safety in MLLM output. All in all, we propose a novel, training-free, ready-to-use framework for MLLM behavior interpretability and control. Our implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-assisted medical imaging analysis demonstrates remarkable performance in early lung cancer screening. However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4$\times$, 3.1$\times$, and 29.5$\times$ better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a Dice Coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8% and 18.6% improvements in Dice and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.

Abstract: Robust grasping in cluttered environments remains an open challenge in robotics. While benchmark datasets have significantly advanced deep learning methods, they mainly focus on simplistic scenes with light occlusion and insufficient diversity, limiting their applicability to practical scenarios. We present GraspClutter6D, a large-scale real-world grasping dataset featuring: (1) 1,000 highly cluttered scenes with dense arrangements (14.1 objects/scene, 62.6\% occlusion), (2) comprehensive coverage across 200 objects in 75 environment configurations (bins, shelves, and tables) captured using four RGB-D cameras from multiple viewpoints, and (3) rich annotations including 736K 6D object poses and 9.3B feasible robotic grasps for 52K RGB-D images. We benchmark state-of-the-art segmentation, object pose estimation, and grasp detection methods to provide key insights into challenges in cluttered environments. Additionally, we validate the dataset's effectiveness as a training resource, demonstrating that grasping networks trained on GraspClutter6D significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets in both simulation and real-world experiments. The dataset, toolkit, and annotation tools are publicly available on our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/graspclutter6d.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.

Abstract: Personalized image generation is crucial for improving the user experience, as it renders reference images into preferred ones according to user visual preferences. Although effective, existing methods face two main issues. First, existing methods treat all items in the user historical sequence equally when extracting user preferences, overlooking the varying semantic similarities between historical items and the reference item. Disproportionately high weights for low-similarity items distort users' visual preferences for the reference item. Second, existing methods heavily rely on consistency between generated and reference images to optimize the generation, which leads to underfitting user preferences and hinders personalization. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval Augment Personalized Image GenerAtion guided by Recommendation (RAGAR). Our approach uses a retrieval mechanism to assign different weights to historical items according to their similarities to the reference item, thereby extracting more refined users' visual preferences for the reference item. Then we introduce a novel rank task based on the multi-modal ranking model to optimize the personalization of the generated images instead of forcing depend on consistency. Extensive experiments and human evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAR achieves significant improvements in both personalization and semantic metrics compared to five baselines.

Abstract: Accurate emotion understanding in videos necessitates effectively recognizing and interpreting emotional states by integrating visual, textual, auditory, and contextual cues. Although recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have exhibited significant progress in general vision-language (VL) tasks, their performance often deteriorates in emotion-specific scenarios, exhibiting catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on emotion-centric tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose Emotion-Qwen, a unified multimodal framework designed to simultaneously enable robust emotion understanding and preserve general VL reasoning capabilities. Emotion-Qwen introduces a novel Hybrid Compressor based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, dynamically routing inputs to optimally balance emotion-specific processing and general multimodal reasoning. We further propose a carefully structured three-stage pre-training pipeline, leveraging extensive general and emotion-focused datasets to strengthen multimodal representation robustness and model adaptability. Additionally, we develop the Video Emotion Reasoning (VER) dataset, a large-scale bilingual resource containing over 40K video clips annotated with detailed context-aware emotional descriptions, significantly facilitating research on fine-grained emotional reasoning. Extensive experiments confirm that Emotion-Qwen achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple emotion recognition and reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive results in general VL tasks.

Abstract: We introduce DualMap, an online open-vocabulary mapping system that enables robots to understand and navigate dynamically changing environments through natural language queries. Designed for efficient semantic mapping and adaptability to changing environments, DualMap meets the essential requirements for real-world robot navigation applications. Our proposed hybrid segmentation frontend and object-level status check eliminate the costly 3D object merging required by prior methods, enabling efficient online scene mapping. The dual-map representation combines a global abstract map for high-level candidate selection with a local concrete map for precise goal-reaching, effectively managing and updating dynamic changes in the environment. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, efficient scene mapping, and online language-guided navigation.Project page: https://eku127.github.io/DualMap/

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking. Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present Garment Inertial Poser (GaIP), a method for estimating full-body poses from sparse and loosely attached IMU sensors. We first simulate IMU recordings using an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. Our transformer-based diffusion models synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses from this challenging loose IMU data. We also demonstrate that incorporating garment-related parameters during training on loose IMU data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Our experiments show that our diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperform state-of-the-art inertial full-body pose estimators, both quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research on motion capture from such realistic sensor placements.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components. First, we introduce (i) Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an (ii) Audio-Guided Attention module that models the interactions between target candidates and mentioned objects, enhancing discrimination in cluttered 3D environments. To support benchmarking, we (iii) synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods, highlight the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher verification rates.

arXiv:2508.03758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring. However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance, irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset. FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672, and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate, explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable, high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving real-world wound assessment and patient care.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Summary: 
The paper introduces ImageDDI, a framework for predicting drug-drug interactions using deep learning. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by focusing on functional motif-based representation learning. ImageDDI tokenizes molecules into motifs and combines them into sequences for representation. It utilizes a transformer-based encoder to embed these motifs, starting from local structure representation. Global molecular image information is incorporated to enhance spatial representation, and Adaptive Feature Fusion dynamically adapts feature fusion. Experimental results show ImageDDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction. It achieves competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced scenarios. The framework shows promise in accurately identifying and predicting drug interactions, crucial for mitigating potential health risks associated with multi-drug use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for \textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder, starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g. texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations. Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced scenarios compared to other models.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment. Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field: https://github.com/christophezei/Optimizing-Object-Detection-Models-for-TinyML-A-Comprehensive-Survey.

<div> Keywords: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks, energy-efficient, image classification, segmentation, Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation

Summary:
Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) with optical frontend and digital backend offer an energy-efficient solution for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, challenges such as accuracy gap and discrepancies between simulated and fabricated systems limit their adoption. A task-agnostic and hardware-agnostic pipeline is proposed to support image classification and segmentation across diverse optical systems. Before training, achievable model accuracy can be estimated based on physical constraints and datasets. Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD) aligns optical models with electronic teacher networks, reducing the accuracy gap during training. NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend post-fabrication to compensate for implementation errors. Experimental results on various datasets and hardware configurations demonstrate consistent improvement in ONN performance, enabling practical deployment in both simulations and physical implementations.

arXiv:2508.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

Script Writing Guidelines are proposed to optimize the compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results show that MAViS outperforms existing frameworks in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. The modular design of MAViS allows for scalability with different generative models and tools.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.

<div> Keywords: virtual try-on, multi-garment diffusion, identity preservation, fashion retail, pose cues 

Summary: 
MuGa-VTON introduces a multi-garment diffusion framework for virtual try-on applications, combining upper and lower garments with person identity in a shared latent space. The Garment Representation Module captures garment semantics, the Person Representation Module encodes identity and pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module integrates features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture supports prompt-based customization for fine-grained garment modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual try-on applications. <div>

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization. However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately, rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual try-on applications.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel diffusion-based architecture called Concurrent Object Layers (CObL) for inferring a scene representation consisting of occlusion-ordered object layers from images. CObL generates isolated and amodally-completed objects in parallel, utilizing Stable Diffusion as a prior and inference-time guidance to ensure accurate reconstruction back to the input image. Trained on synthetic images of tabletop scenes, CObL demonstrates zero-shot generalization to real-world photographs with varying numbers of novel objects. CObL reconstructs multiple occluded objects without user input and without prior knowledge of the number of objects present. Unlike existing models, CObL is not limited to the training world, showcasing its versatility in object-centric representation learning.

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers," each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

<div> Annotation, multimodal models, narrative understanding, visual storytelling, temporal causality

Summary:
This study investigates the limitations of Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) in processing sequential visual storytelling, focusing on manga narrative understanding. The researchers introduce a novel evaluation framework involving fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented assessment to address these limitations. Through rigorous annotation and evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, they reveal that VLMs excel at individual panel interpretation but struggle with temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion for coherent story comprehension. Analysis of cross-modal similarity highlights misalignments in current VLMs' joint representations. Applying the framework to Re:Zero manga, the study explores generative storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Findings indicate that current models lack story-level intelligence, particularly in non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes a foundation for evaluating narrative intelligence and offers insights for advancing deep sequential understanding in Multimodal Models.

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii) comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence, struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence, while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in Multimodal Models.

<div> Keywords: pediatric chest X-ray imaging, low-dose protocols, denoising, structure-aware dual-decoder U-Net, pneumonia classification

Summary:
SharpXR is a novel denoising model specifically designed for pediatric chest X-ray imaging in low-resource settings. It addresses the challenge of noise reduction while preserving important anatomical details by utilizing a structure-aware dual-decoder U-Net architecture. By combining a Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module, SharpXR effectively suppresses noise without compromising structural information. The model, trained on simulated realistic noise data, outperforms existing methods in terms of denoising quality and computational efficiency. Notably, SharpXR improves pneumonia classification accuracy, demonstrating its potential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in pediatric care settings with limited resources. The study highlights the importance of advanced imaging techniques in improving early diagnosis and treatment outcomes for children. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details. Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource pediatric care.

Summary:
VISOR introduces a novel method for behavioral control in Vision Language Models (VLMs) using optimized visual inputs. This method allows for sophisticated control through universal steering images, enabling practical deployment across all VLM serving modalities without the need for invasive runtime access. VISOR achieves up to 25% shifts in behavioral patterns compared to traditional steering vectors. It outperforms system prompting for bidirectional control and maintains high performance on unrelated tasks. Furthermore, VISOR exposes a security vulnerability where adversaries can manipulate model behavior using only visual inputs. This work highlights the importance of defenses against visual steering attacks in protecting VLMs from malicious manipulation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront. While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective, activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments. We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25% shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However, transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

<br />Summary: <br />
Probability calibration is crucial for ensuring the reliability of predictions, especially in sensitive applications involving Vision Transformers. The traditional method of post-hoc temperature scaling, which utilizes a single global scalar and requires a validation set, is improved upon with the introduction of Calibration Attention (CalAttn). This new module enables the learning of adaptive, instance-specific temperatures directly from the ViT's CLS token. Evaluations on various datasets such as CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate that CalAttn significantly reduces calibration error by up to 4 times on models like ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin with minimal increase in parameters. The learned temperatures from CalAttn closely hover around 1.0, contrasting the commonly large global values used in standard temperature scaling techniques. CalAttn is easy to implement, efficient, compatible with different architectures, and enhances the credibility of probability estimates without compromising accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling, uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under 0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy.

Summary:<br />
- Challenges in medical image segmentation include limited annotation and domain shift. Conventional methods tailored to specific tasks lead to suboptimal performance due to error accumulation.

The framework showed notable improvements over state-of-the-art methods across different settings, demonstrating its potential for addressing challenging Semi-Supervised Learning scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation. Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models, which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data, The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations, we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

Summary:
FLIPNET, a unified network, addresses the gap between the vanilla diffusion model and blind face restoration settings by switching between Restoration and Degradation modes. In Restoration mode, the model integrates features for authentic and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, FLIPNET synthesizes real-world-like degraded images using knowledge from real-world degradation datasets. The model outperforms previous diffusion prior-based BFR methods in authenticity and fidelity. It also surpasses naive degradation models in modeling real-world degradations. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of FLIPNET in handling moderately to severely degraded images and simulating complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2) synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in modeling the real-world degradations.

Summary: 
AutoSAME is a novel framework introduced to automate left ventricular indicator measurements in echocardiography by combining segmentation and landmark localization tasks. The framework utilizes the segment anything model (SAM) to achieve visual understanding and mimic the operation of cardiac sonographers. The addition of filtered cross-branch attention (FCBA) enhances heatmap regression for key point localization. Spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) improves dense predictions by leveraging spatial properties of the left ventricle. Experimental results on echocardiography datasets demonstrate the efficacy of AutoSAME in accurately segmenting the left ventricle, localizing landmarks, and measuring indicators according to clinical guidelines. The code for AutoSAME will be available on GitHub for further exploration and utilization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However, VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously. Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers, achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective, optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and indicator measurements. The code will be available at https://github.com/QC-LIU-1997/AutoSAME.

Summary: 
The proposed method aims to enhance group robustness to spurious correlations by leveraging superclass information in class labels. By using gradient-based attention guided by a pre-trained vision-language model, the model can disentangle superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. This approach reduces reliance on spurious features and promotes the use of superclass-relevant features for prediction. The method does not require annotation of any source samples, making it more practical for real-world settings. Experimental results across various datasets show that the method outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with improvements seen in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

arXiv:2508.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel framework for generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions. The framework separates motion from appearance, subject from background, and action from trajectory, allowing for flexible composition of these elements. By creating a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system, motion editing is performed directly in 3D space. Trajectory control involves unprojecting 2D trajectories into 3D, aligning speed, and adjusting orientation. Actions can be sourced from a motion bank or generated through text-to-motion methods. The subject is treated as tokens for full attention in the video generation process, along with the background video and motion control signals. This approach enables the generation of realistic videos depicting various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the method's superior performance in both element-wise controllability and overall video quality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper, we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention, concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion (trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

DocThinker introduces a rule-based Reinforcement Learning framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Instead of static Chain-of-Thought templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies through policy learning. It generates explainable intermediate results such as structured reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest supporting the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based rewards and KL-constrained optimization, DocThinker mitigates catastrophic forgetting, enhances adaptability, and improves transparency. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that DocThinker significantly enhances generalization and provides more explainable and human-understandable reasoning steps. This research demonstrates the potential of Reinforcement Learning as a valuable tool for increasing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based document understanding. Code for DocThinker will be accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/wenwenyu/DocThinker.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial, and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks. In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly improves generalization while producing more explainable and human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based document understanding.

<div> Transformer-based framework, HOI detection, QueryCraft, ACTOR, PDQD

Summary:
The article introduces QueryCraft, a novel HOI detection framework that addresses the limitation of suboptimal performance in DETR-based methods by including semantic priors and guided feature learning through transformer-based query initialization. The framework incorporates ACTOR, a cross-modal Transformer encoder that leverages language-guided attention to extract action-relevant features and infer interaction semantics. Additionally, PDQD is introduced to enhance object-level query quality by distilling object category awareness from a pre-trained detector for object query initiation. The dual-branch query initialization results in more interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization of the proposed method.Code for the framework will be released upon publication.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is \textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal \textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released upon publication.

Summary: 
Yan is a comprehensive framework for interactive video generation that encompasses simulation, generation, and editing. The framework consists of three main modules: AAA-level Simulation, Multi-Modal Generation, and Multi-Granularity Editing. The AAA-level Simulation module utilizes a 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process for real-time interactive simulation. The Multi-Modal Generation module incorporates game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models to create a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time interactive video generator. The model demonstrates strong generalization when prompts are sourced from different domains, allowing for flexible blending of styles and mechanics. The Multi-Granularity Editing module disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing through text interaction. Yan integrates these modules to push interactive video generation towards an AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, promising advancements in creative tools, media, and entertainment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation, covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing. Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First, to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring (SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames. Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing self-supervised ones.

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer (IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model for video instance segmentation that addresses the issues of catastrophic forgetting and fixed object categories in existing approaches. The HVPL model incorporates a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC) module to encode global instance information for new classes at the frame level. Additionally, a task-specific video prompt and video context decoder are designed to embed inter-class relationships across frames and propagate video contexts at the video level. The model outperforms baseline approaches in mitigating forgetting and adapting to new object categories. The code for the HVPL model is available at the provided GitHub repository. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames. However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

<br /><br />Summary: Knowledge distillation is enhanced by the Aligned Manifold Entropy (AME) method, which minimizes entropy over a shared manifold to improve robust generalization in vision-language distillation. The integration of knowledge distillation with entropy minimization on the shared manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound, ultimately improving the performance of the distillation process. AME does not require architectural modifications and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module in various distillation frameworks, consistently yielding superior generalization performance across a range of downstream tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations, which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions, conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations. This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

<div> framework, unsupervised domain adaptation, medical image segmentation, probabilistic manifold, anatomical knowledge <br />
<br />
The article introduces a novel framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in medical image segmentation that bridges the gap between source-accessible and source-free settings. Unlike previous approaches, this framework does not rely on handcrafted adaptation strategies, instead leveraging a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold to capture global anatomical regularities. This structured approach allows for semantically meaningful predictions and inherent adaptability. Experimental results on cardiac and abdominal datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both settings, with the source-free adaptation closely matching the performance of the source-accessible approach. The model's interpretability is showcased through manifold traversal, enabling smooth shape manipulation and providing insights into the underlying anatomical structures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting, where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth shape manipulation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL) approach for deep image watermarking to improve invisibility, robustness, and applicability. The two-stage optimization involves distribution alignment learning to create a common latent space for watermark embedding and recovery. This ensures imperceptible watermarking and reliable extraction under various conditions. The second stage focuses on watermark representation learning to disentangle watermarks from image content in RGB space. By penalizing fluctuations in separated watermarks, HiWL effectively learns generalizable watermark representations while maintaining low latency. Experimental results show superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving higher accuracy in watermark extraction with significantly faster processing speed. HiWL addresses the limitations of current methods and offers a promising solution for efficient and effective image watermarking. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks), 2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3) broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images processed in 8s).

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method, MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network (IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities. To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning, addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method. Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves promising performance.

<div> Ultrasound, deformable registration, physics-aware framework, contact force, anatomical alignment<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces a new physics-aware deformable registration framework, PADReg, for ultrasound images. Ultrasound deformable registration is challenging due to low contrast and noise, hindering accurate feature extraction. PADReg utilizes contact force data as a physical prior to improve registration accuracy. Instead of directly predicting deformation fields, a stiffness map is constructed from contact force and ultrasound images and used in tandem with force data to estimate a dense deformation field. Inspired by Hooke's law, PADReg ensures physically plausible registration with improved anatomical alignment compared to existing methods. Experiments on in-vivo datasets show a significant improvement in registration accuracy, with a HD95 of 12.90, 21.34% better than current state-of-the-art methods. The source code for PADReg is publicly available for further research. <div>
arXiv:2508.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching. Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images. The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS, significantly outperforming prior models.

<div> banding artifacts, video compression, quality assessment, dataset creation, CBAND model <br />
<br />
Summary: 
Bandwidth artifacts are persisting issues in video compression despite technological advancements, particularly affecting high-definition video quality. To address this, a novel video dataset named LIVE-YT-Banding with 160 videos compressed using AV1 codec was created, along with 7200 subjective opinions from 45 individuals. The dataset allowed for studying temporal banding dynamics, crucial for advanced video codecs. A new no-reference video quality evaluator, CBAND, was introduced, leveraging deep neural network embeddings on natural image statistics to predict perceptual banding with high accuracy and efficiency. CBAND outperformed existing models significantly and can be used as a loss function for video debanding model optimization. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality. Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR) video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a model repair module to address systematic errors in deep learning models for visual recognition. Existing debugging frameworks often struggle to effectively repair these errors, leading to manual design of synthetic training images. The proposed approach leverages a conditional text-to-image model and a large vision-language model to generate targeted and semantically faithful images for failure cases. By retraining vision models with this augmented synthetic dataset, errors associated with rare cases are significantly reduced. The experiments show that this targeted repair strategy improves model robustness without introducing new bugs. The code for this approach is available on GitHub at https://github.com/oxu2/SafeFix. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes, repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases. To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at https://github.com/oxu2/SafeFix

<div> Keywords: lens structure segmentation, intraocular lenses, deep learning, adaptive confidence-wise loss, boundary calibration

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach, Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss, for precise segmentation of lens structures in cataract surgery. Unlike existing methods, ACW considers the varying confidence levels of expert annotations for different sub-regions of lens structures. By grouping regions into low and high confidence clusters and applying region-weighted loss, ACW outperforms other segmentation methods. An adaptive threshold optimization algorithm dynamically adjusts the confidence threshold for improved accuracy. A new metric, Boundary Expected Calibration Error (BECE), quantifies miscalibration errors in boundary region segmentation. Extensive experiments on clinical datasets show significant improvements in performance, with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction compared to traditional methods, particularly under the U-Net network. Overall, ACW shows promise in enhancing the accuracy and precision of lens structure segmentation in cataract surgery. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss, overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous (e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically, experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions, ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation, we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available at https://github.com/XiaoLing12138/Adaptive-Confidence-Wise-Loss.

<div> Keywords: AI-generated videos, deepfake detection, social networks, compression, emulator

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of detecting deepfakes in AI-generated videos that are shared on social networks. Existing detectors struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios due to aggressive compression applied by platforms like YouTube and Facebook. The proposed framework aims to emulate the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. This approach enables the creation of a local emulator that can reproduce platform-specific artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments show that the emulated data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads, and detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos perform comparably to those trained on actual shared media. This innovative solution offers a scalable and practical way to improve the deployment of deepfake detectors in the realm of compressed video content. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However, replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore, detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of compressed video content.

Summary: 
- The article introduces a new benchmark called ROOMELSA for evaluating systems' ability to interpret natural language in 3D retrieval tasks. 
- ROOMELSA focuses on retrieving 3D models based on vague, free-form descriptions in cluttered scenes from panoramic room images. 
- The benchmark includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms, and more than 44,000 targeted queries. 
- While coarse object retrieval is well-solved, only one model consistently ranked the correct match first across most test cases. 
- A lightweight CLIP-based model also performed well but struggled with subtle variations in materials and contextual cues, leading to occasional errors.

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically, ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms, and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Summary:<br />
DiffPose-Animal introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for animal pose estimation, addressing the challenges posed by interspecies morphological diversity and limited data annotations. It reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process using diffusion models, utilizing large language models to extract global anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics. These textual priors are fused with image features to provide biologically meaningful constraints during keypoint generation. A diffusion-based keypoint decoder refines pose predictions progressively, enhancing robustness to occlusion and sparse annotations. Experimental results on public animal pose datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and generalization capability, particularly in challenging scenarios with diverse species and cluttered backgrounds. The approach shows promise for applications in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and livestock management. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Summary: 
The paper introduces RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening model that aims to enhance video quality while saving on bitrate. Traditional sharpening techniques often apply uniform sharpening intensity across the video, leading to degradation in quality as texture variations are ignored. Additionally, the increase in bitrate from sharpening is not optimally allocated across different regions. RPO-AdaSharp utilizes the coding tree unit (CTU) partition mask to inform the allocation of additional bits, resulting in improved perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model both qualitatively and quantitatively.Overall, RPO-AdaSharp provides a promising solution for enhancing video quality in a region-adaptive manner while efficiently managing bitrate allocation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality. Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

<br />
Summary:<br />
MonoPartNeRF introduces a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering. It utilizes a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid transformations to establish a continuous mapping between observation and canonical spaces, improving accuracy in capturing complex pose variations. The framework incorporates a part-based pose embedding mechanism that decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings guided by body regions, enhancing joint alignment. Furthermore, keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation are utilized for pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable appearance code integrated through attention enables effective modeling of dynamic texture changes, resulting in superior texture fidelity. Experimental results on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate MonoPartNeRF's ability to outperform existing methods in handling complex pose variations and occlusion, achieving excellent joint alignment, texture fidelity, and structural continuity. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion. A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and structural continuity.

Summary:<br />
- The paper discusses the use of generative AI for face aging and de-aging, highlighting the challenges of conditioning methods for generating consistent results.
- The authors propose a method to synthesize aged and de-aged faces by editing the latent space of StyleGAN2, utilizing support vector modeling and feature selection approaches.
- Empirical findings reveal an identity-preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2 latent space, allowing for age changes while maintaining identity.
- A formula is suggested for estimating limits on aging/de-aging parameters to ensure identity preservation.
- The authors have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages for benchmarking cross-age face recognition systems and age assurance systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media. However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models (VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs, and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems, we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2 latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems, or systems for detection of synthetic images.

<div> Keywords: Semantic segmentation, efficient architectures, offset learning paradigm, image features, pixel-level scene understanding

Summary:
Semantic segmentation is crucial for vision systems, but deploying it on resource-constrained devices requires efficient architectures. Existing methods achieve real-time inference through lightweight designs, but struggle with misalignment between class representations and image features. This challenge stems from a per-pixel classification paradigm, which assumes image pixel features do not vary for the same category in different images. To overcome this limitation, a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm is proposed, which dynamically refines class representations and spatial image features. The proposed OffSeg network leverages this paradigm and shows consistent improvements across various datasets with minimal additional parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset, the offset learning paradigm enhances SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, requiring only 0.1-0.2M additional parameters.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset, our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M additional parameters required.

arXiv:2508.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1) token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA (TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules.

Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered, part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a 55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

Summary: This study introduces a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) based on directional image curvature analysis. Anisotropic Texture Richness (ATR) is defined as a measure computed at the pixel level using tunable thresholds to quantify texture suppression. Optimized ATR scores show high correlation with human perception for Gaussian blur and white noise. A two-stage system leverages ATR responses to classify primary artifact types with high accuracy and then uses a regression model to map ATR scores to quality ratings. The system predicts human scores with a high coefficient of determination and low Root Mean Square Error, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This framework serves as a robust tool for classifying and quantifying image degradation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature. Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness (ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression. When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and -0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over 97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy. Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing changes over different times

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new competitive results. The code and models will be released at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture, segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity. Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0 guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to 7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-, voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core, contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively. Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification, and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel cross-view network for LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving. Existing approaches for LPR often overlook the intrinsic structures and intra-class variances of the feature space, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear data distributions. The proposed framework includes a pseudo-global information guidance mechanism and a Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to compute Mahalanobis distance, enhancing the model's ability to characterize intrinsic data distributions and inter-class dependencies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions, leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space. Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency, reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup. Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a volunteer scan.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging, scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence. Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11 minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to 32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression, offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image, resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts, high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency, reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details. Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1 million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300 hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated. The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at https://github.com/Elman295/TCSSM.

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free, plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks. Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the same speedups.

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

Despite advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame, thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

<title>Spatial-Temporal Multi-Scale Quantization for Flexible Motion Generation</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

<title>UniConvNet: Expanding Effective Receptive Field while Maintaining Asymptotically Gaussian Distribution for ConvNets of Any Scale</title>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field (ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$, $11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017, and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$ FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/ai-paperwithcode/UniConvNet.

<title>Towards Perfection: Building Inter-component Mutual Correction for Retinex-based Low-light Image Enhancement</title>

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals (ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model. Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

<title>When Deepfakes Look Real: Detecting AI-Generated Faces with Unlabeled Data due to Annotation Challenges</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09022</link>

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data. However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even \textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks. Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct, AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the increasing realism of deepfakes.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging.

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design. Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention, capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage PDM features - previously designed to capture identity - and show how they can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods, and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

<title>ALFred: An Active Learning Framework for Real-world Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Thresholds</title>

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments, ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task. However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years. However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend, enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations. This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on secure access.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3) We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs, Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and rendering techniques.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs) in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43 rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class, and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3, and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km (median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70% (Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12 km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields; however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue, assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework, MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust, domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains. Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Motivated by biomedical imaging applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network, approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice data is sparse and noisy.

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines. Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous works.

<title>Improving Facial Rig Semantics for Tracking and Retargeting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08429</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR) environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting, we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially non-differentiable) black box.

<title>Preprocessing Algorithm Leveraging Geometric Modeling for Scale Correction in Hyperspectral Images for Improved Unmixing Performance</title>

Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral variability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by factors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate model fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and compensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm provides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively on modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's impact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms, including those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with error reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by existing methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines. The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution for complex segmentation tasks.

<title>Hybrid Long and Short Range Flows for Point Cloud Filtering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08542</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn, score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface. Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule, each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores, guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results while enabling faster inference speed.

<title>Multi-level Collaborative Distillation Meets Global Workspace Model: A Unified Framework for OCIL</title>

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective. While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared, implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch, capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models across various memory budgets.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning, which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H, STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3% higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will be available.

<title>Exploring Palette based Color Guidance in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more controlled and refined colorization process.

<title>Silicon Minds versus Human Hearts: The Wisdom of Crowds Beats the Wisdom of AI in Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants. Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence, human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.

<title>Frequency-Assisted Adaptive Sharpening Scheme Considering Bitrate and Quality Tradeoff</title>

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can effectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the sharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily improve with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as over-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video quality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs effectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening level Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening level correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth. Then taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages intricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal sharpening level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of detail.

Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques. Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However, most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches. We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening. Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient (x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or SSIM.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA (GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open foundations for further CUA research.

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions. Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency. Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1 Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally, our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

Abstract: Diplomatics, the analysis of medieval charters, is a major field of research in which paleography is applied. Annotating data, if performed by laymen, needs validation and correction by experts. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient annotation approach for charter segmentation, essentially reducing it to object detection. This approach allows for a much more efficient use of the paleographer's time and produces results that can compete and even outperform pixel-level segmentation in some use cases. Further experiments shed light on how to design a class ontology in order to make the best use of annotators' time and effort. Exploiting the presence of calibration cards in the image, we further annotate the data with the physical length in pixels and train regression neural networks to predict it from image patches.

Abstract: Recently, Transformer-based text detection techniques have sought to predict polygons by encoding the coordinates of individual boundary vertices using distinct query features. However, this approach incurs a significant memory overhead and struggles to effectively capture the intricate relationships between vertices belonging to the same instance. Consequently, irregular text layouts often lead to the prediction of outlined vertices, diminishing the quality of results. To address these challenges, we present an innovative approach rooted in Sparse R-CNN: a cascade decoding pipeline for polygon prediction. Our method ensures precision by iteratively refining polygon predictions, considering both the scale and location of preceding results. Leveraging this stabilized regression pipeline, even employing just a single feature vector to guide polygon instance regression yields promising detection results. Simultaneously, the leverage of instance-level feature proposal substantially enhances memory efficiency (>50% less vs. the state-of-the-art method DPText-DETR) and reduces inference speed (>40% less vs. DPText-DETR) with minor performance drop on benchmarks.

Abstract: Most existing learning-based multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) methods suffer from significant structure inconsistency due to their inappropriate usage of structural features at the semantic level. To alleviate these issues, we propose a semantic structure-preserving fusion approach for MMIF, namely SSPFusion. At first, we design a structural feature extractor (SFE) to extract the prominent structural features from multiple input images. Concurrently, we introduce a transformation function with Sobel operator to generate self-supervised structural signals in these extracted features. Subsequently, we design a multi-scale structure-preserving fusion (SPF) module, guided by the generated structural signals, to merge the structural features of input images. This process ensures the preservation of semantic structure consistency between the resultant fusion image and the input images. Through the synergy of these two robust modules of SFE and SPF, our method can generate high-quality fusion images and demonstrate good generalization ability. Experimental results, on both infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion tasks, demonstrate that our method outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Event cameras are a novel type of biologically inspired vision sensor known for their high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. Because of these properties, they are well-suited for processing fast motions that require rapid reactions. Although event cameras have recently shown competitive performance in unsupervised optical flow estimation, performance in detecting independently moving objects (IMOs) is lacking behind, although event-based methods would be suited for this task based on their low latency and HDR properties. Previous approaches to event-based IMO segmentation have been heavily dependent on labeled data. However, biological vision systems have developed the ability to avoid moving objects through daily tasks without being given explicit labels. In this work, we propose the first event framework that generates IMO pseudo-labels using geometric constraints. Due to its unsupervised nature, our method can handle an arbitrary number of not predetermined objects and is easily scalable to datasets where expensive IMO labels are not readily available. We evaluate our approach on the EVIMO dataset and show that it performs competitively with supervised methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: This article adopts and evaluates an AI-enabled Smart Video Solution (SVS) designed to enhance safety in the real world. The system integrates with existing infrastructure camera networks, leveraging recent advancements in AI for easy adoption. Prioritizing privacy and ethical standards, pose based data is used for downstream AI tasks such as anomaly detection. Cloud-based infrastructure and mobile app are deployed, enabling real-time alerts within communities. The SVS employs innovative data representation and visualization techniques, such as the Occupancy Indicator, Statistical Anomaly Detection, Bird's Eye View, and Heatmaps, to understand pedestrian behaviors and enhance public safety. Evaluation of the SVS demonstrates its capacity to convert complex computer vision outputs into actionable insights for stakeholders, community partners, law enforcement, urban planners, and social scientists. This article presents a comprehensive real-world deployment and evaluation of the SVS, implemented in a community college environment across 16 cameras. The system integrates AI-driven visual processing, supported by statistical analysis, database management, cloud communication, and user notifications. Additionally, the article evaluates the end-to-end latency from the moment an AI algorithm detects anomalous behavior in real-time at the camera level to the time stakeholders receive a notification. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, effectively managing 16 CCTV cameras with a consistent throughput of 16.5 frames per second (FPS) over a 21-hour period and an average end-to-end latency of 26.76 seconds between anomaly detection and alert issuance.

<title>PointDreamer: Zero-shot 3D Textured Mesh Reconstruction from Colored Point Cloud</title>

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured meshes is crucial for many applications. Compared to text or image modalities, leveraging 3D colored point clouds as input (colored-PC-to-mesh) offers inherent advantages in comprehensively and precisely replicating the target object's 360{\deg} characteristics. While most existing colored-PC-to-mesh methods suffer from blurry textures or require hard-to-acquire 3D training data, we propose PointDreamer, a novel framework that harnesses 2D diffusion prior for superior texture quality. Crucially, unlike prior 2D-diffusion-for-3D works driven by text or image inputs, PointDreamer successfully adapts 2D diffusion models to 3D point cloud data by a novel project-inpaint-unproject pipeline. Specifically, it first projects the point cloud into sparse 2D images and then performs diffusion-based inpainting. After that, diverging from most existing 3D reconstruction or generation approaches that predict texture in 3D/UV space thus often yielding blurry texture, PointDreamer achieves high-quality texture by directly unprojecting the inpainted 2D images to the 3D mesh. Furthermore, we identify for the first time a typical kind of unprojection artifact appearing in occlusion borders, which is common in other multiview-image-to-3D pipelines but less-explored. To address this, we propose a novel solution named the Non-Border-First (NBF) unprojection strategy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various synthetic and real-scanned datasets demonstrate that PointDreamer, though zero-shot, exhibits SoTA performance (30% improvement on LPIPS score from 0.118 to 0.068), and is robust to noisy, sparse, or even incomplete input data.

Abstract: Story visualization aims to create visually compelling images or videos corresponding to textual narratives. Despite recent advances in diffusion models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story. To this end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion model. DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating consistent multi-subject across the images. First, DreamStory employs the LLM to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story, annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation. Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance). Finally, the MSD uses these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent multi-subject. Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention (MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules. MMSA and MMCA modules ensure appearance and semantic consistency with reference images and text, respectively. Both modules employ masking mechanisms to prevent subject blending. To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization, we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the consistency of the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations. Please visit our project homepage at https://dream-xyz.github.io/dreamstory.

Abstract: Open-Vocab 3D Instance Segmentation methods (OV-3DIS) have recently demonstrated their ability to generalize to unseen objects. However, these methods still depend on predefined class names during testing, restricting the autonomy of agents. To mitigate this constraint, we propose a novel problem termed Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation (OE-3DIS), which eliminates the necessity for predefined class names during testing. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive set of strong baselines, derived from OV-3DIS approaches and leveraging 2D Multimodal Large Language Models. To assess the performance of our OE-3DIS system, we introduce a novel Open-Ended score, evaluating both the semantic and geometric quality of predicted masks and their associated class names, alongside the standard AP score. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baselines on the ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ datasets. Remarkably, our method surpasses the performance of Open3DIS, the current state-of-the-art method in OV-3DIS, even in the absence of ground-truth object class names.

Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has achieved significant progress in both research and applications. While recent baselines struggle to generate natural and continuous facial movements due to their frame-by-frame vertex generation approach, we propose 3DFacePolicy, a pioneer work that introduces a novel definition of vertex trajectory changes across consecutive frames through the concept of "action". By predicting action sequences for each vertex that encode frame-to-frame movements, we reformulate vertex generation approach into an action-based control paradigm. Specifically, we leverage a robotic control mechanism, diffusion policy, to predict action sequences conditioned on both audio and vertex states. Extensive experiments on VOCASET and BIWI datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is particularly expert in dynamic, expressive and naturally smooth facial animations.

Abstract: Facial expression datasets remain limited in scale due to the subjectivity of annotations and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. This limitation poses a significant challenge for developing modern deep learning-based facial expression analysis models, particularly foundation models, that rely on large-scale data for optimal performance. To tackle the overarching and complex challenge, instead of introducing a new large-scale dataset, we introduce SynFER (Synthesis of Facial Expressions with Refined Control), a novel synthetic framework for synthesizing facial expression image data based on high-level textual descriptions as well as more fine-grained and precise control through facial action units. To ensure the quality and reliability of the synthetic data, we propose a semantic guidance technique to steer the generation process and a pseudo-label generator to help rectify the facial expression labels for the synthetic images. To demonstrate the generation fidelity and the effectiveness of the synthetic data from SynFER, we conduct extensive experiments on representation learning using both synthetic data and real-world data. Results validate the efficacy of our approach and the synthetic data. Notably, our approach achieves a 67.23% classification accuracy on AffectNet when training solely with synthetic data equivalent to the AffectNet training set size, which increases to 69.84% when scaling up to five times the original size.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) seeks to recover high-quality images from degraded observations caused by a wide range of factors, including noise, blur, compression, and adverse weather. While traditional IR methods have made notable progress by targeting individual degradation types, their specialization often comes at the cost of generalization, leaving them ill-equipped to handle the multifaceted distortions encountered in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance the convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we provide the first in-depth and systematic overview of AiOIR, delivering a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing methods by architectural designs, learning paradigms, and their core innovations. We systematically categorize current approaches and assess the challenges these models encounter, outlining research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. To facilitate the evaluation of existing methods, we also consolidate widely-used datasets, evaluation protocols, and implementation practices, and compare and summarize the most advanced open-source models. As the first comprehensive review dedicated to AiOIR, this paper aims to map the conceptual landscape, synthesize prevailing techniques, and ignite further exploration toward more intelligent, unified, and adaptable visual restoration systems.

Abstract: Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this paper, we argue that videos contain significantly more redundant information than images, allowing them to be encoded with very few motion latents. Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE that projects videos into extremely compressed latent space and decode them based on content images. This magic Reducio charm enables 64x reduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality. Building upon Reducio-VAE, we can train diffusion models for high-resolution video generation efficiently. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage generation paradigm, first generating a condition image via text-to-image generation, followed by text-image-to-video generation with the proposed Reducio-DiT. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves strong performance in evaluation. More importantly, our method significantly boosts the training and inference efficiency of video LDMs. Reducio-DiT is trained in just 3.2K A100 GPU hours in total and can generate a 16-frame 1024$\times$1024 video clip within 15.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

Abstract: Generating 3D meshes from a single image is an important but ill-posed task. Existing methods mainly adopt 2D multiview diffusion models to generate intermediate multiview images, and use the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) to create the final meshes. However, the multiview images exhibit local inconsistencies, and the meshes often lack fidelity to the input image or look blurry. We propose Fancy123, featuring two enhancement modules and an unprojection operation to address the above three issues, respectively. The appearance enhancement module deforms the 2D multiview images to realign misaligned pixels for better multiview consistency. The fidelity enhancement module deforms the 3D mesh to match the input image. The unprojection of the input image and deformed multiview images onto LRM's generated mesh ensures high clarity, discarding LRM's predicted blurry-looking mesh colors. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify Fancy123's SoTA performance with significant improvement. Also, the two enhancement modules are plug-and-play and work at inference time, allowing seamless integration into various existing single-image-to-3D methods.

Abstract: Detecting prohibited items in X-ray security imagery is a challenging yet crucial task. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, object detection algorithms have been widely applied in this area. However, the distribution of object classes in real-world prohibited item detection scenarios often exhibits a distinct long-tailed distribution. Due to the unique principles of X-ray imaging, conventional methods for long-tailed object detection are often ineffective in this domain. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Prior-Aware Debiasing Framework (PAD-F), a novel approach that employs a two-pronged strategy leveraging both material and co-occurrence priors. At the data level, our Explicit Material-Aware Augmentation (EMAA) component generates numerous challenging training samples for tail classes. It achieves this through a placement strategy guided by material-specific absorption rates and a gradient-based Poisson blending technique. At the feature level, the Implicit Co-occurrence Aggregator (ICA) acts as a plug-in module that enhances features for ambiguous objects by implicitly learning and aggregating statistical co-occurrence relationships within the image. Extensive experiments on the HiXray and PIDray datasets demonstrate that PAD-F significantly boosts the performance of multiple popular detectors. It achieves an absolute improvement of up to +17.2% in AP50 for tail classes and comprehensively outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides an effective and versatile solution to the critical problem of long-tailed detection in X-ray security.

Abstract: Recent 4D reconstruction methods have yielded impressive results but rely on sharp videos as supervision. However, motion blur often occurs in videos due to camera shake and object movement, while existing methods render blurry results when using such videos for reconstructing 4D models. Although a few approaches attempted to address the problem, they struggled to produce high-quality results, due to the inaccuracy in estimating continuous dynamic representations within the exposure time. Encouraged by recent works in 3D motion trajectory modeling using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we take 3DGS as the scene representation manner, and propose Deblur4DGS to reconstruct a high-quality 4D model from blurry monocular video. Specifically, we transform continuous dynamic representations estimation within an exposure time into the exposure time estimation. Moreover, we introduce the exposure regularization term, multi-frame, and multi-resolution consistency regularization term to avoid trivial solutions. Furthermore, to better represent objects with large motion, we suggest blur-aware variable canonical Gaussians. Beyond novel-view synthesis, Deblur4DGS can be applied to improve blurry video from multiple perspectives, including deblurring, frame interpolation, and video stabilization. Extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world data on the above four tasks show that Deblur4DGS outperforms state-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of learning good representations from real-world continuous uncurated data streams. However, most existing works in visual self-supervised learning focus on static images or artificial data streams. Towards exploring a more realistic learning substrate, we investigate streaming self-supervised learning from long-form real-world egocentric video streams. Inspired by the event segmentation mechanism in human perception and memory, we propose "Memory Storyboard" that groups recent past frames into temporal segments for more effective summarization of the past visual streams for memory replay. To accommodate efficient temporal segmentation, we propose a two-tier memory hierarchy: the recent past is stored in a short-term memory, and the storyboard temporal segments are then transferred to a long-term memory. Experiments on real-world egocentric video datasets including SAYCam and KrishnaCam show that contrastive learning objectives on top of storyboard frames result in semantically meaningful representations that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning methods.

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of using large multimodal models (LMMs) to automatically annotate human emotions in everyday scenarios. We conducted experiments on the DailyLife subset of the publicly available FERV39k dataset, employing the GPT-4o-mini model for rapid, zero-shot labeling of key frames extracted from video segments. Under a seven-class emotion taxonomy ("Angry," "Disgust," "Fear," "Happy," "Neutral," "Sad," "Surprise"), the LMM achieved an average precision of approximately 50%. In contrast, when limited to ternary emotion classification (negative/neutral/positive), the average precision increased to approximately 64%. Additionally, we explored a strategy that integrates multiple frames within 1-2 second video clips to enhance labeling performance and reduce costs. The results indicate that this approach can slightly improve annotation accuracy. Overall, our preliminary findings highlight the potential application of zero-shot LMMs in human facial emotion annotation tasks, offering new avenues for reducing labeling costs and broadening the applicability of LMMs in complex multimodal environments.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are a powerful yet underexplored class of generative models compared to U-Net-based diffusion architectures. We propose TIDE-Temporal-aware sparse autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion transformErs-a framework designed to extract sparse, interpretable activation features across timesteps in DiTs. TIDE effectively captures temporally-varying representations and reveals that DiTs naturally learn hierarchical semantics (e.g., 3D structure, object class, and fine-grained concepts) during large-scale pretraining. Experiments show that TIDE enhances interpretability and controllability while maintaining reasonable generation quality, enabling applications such as safe image editing and style transfer.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes progressively while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Recent advances in this field have shifted towards parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, with many approaches building upon the framework that maintains a pool of learnable prompts. Although effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, primarily due to prompt pool querying and increased input sequence lengths from prompt concatenation. In this work, we present a novel prompt-based approach that addresses this limitation. Our method trains a single set of shared prompts across all tasks and, rather than concatenating prompts to the input, directly modifies the CLS token's attention computation by adding the prompts to it. This simple and lightweight design not only significantly reduces computational complexity-both in terms of inference costs and the number of trainable parameters-but also eliminates the need to optimize prompt lengths for different downstream tasks, offering a more efficient yet powerful solution for rehearsal-free class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to establish a new prompt-based CIL paradigm. Furthermore, experiments on general recognition benchmarks beyond the CIL setting also show strong performance, positioning our method as a promising candidate for a general parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.

Abstract: Open Semantic Mapping (OSM) is a key technology in robotic perception, combining semantic segmentation and SLAM techniques. This paper introduces a dynamically configurable and highly automated LLM/LVLM-powered pipeline for evaluating OSM solutions called OSMa-Bench (Open Semantic Mapping Benchmark). The study focuses on evaluating state-of-the-art semantic mapping algorithms under varying indoor lighting conditions, a critical challenge in indoor environments. We introduce a novel dataset with simulated RGB-D sequences and ground truth 3D reconstructions, facilitating the rigorous analysis of mapping performance across different lighting conditions. Through experiments on leading models such as ConceptGraphs, BBQ and OpenScene, we evaluate the semantic fidelity of object recognition and segmentation. Additionally, we introduce a Scene Graph evaluation method to analyze the ability of models to interpret semantic structure. The results provide insights into the robustness of these models, forming future research directions for developing resilient and adaptable robotic systems.

Abstract: Although recent methods have tried to introduce large multimodal models (LMMs) into industrial anomaly detection (IAD), their generalization in the IAD field is far inferior to that for general purposes. We summarize the main reasons for this gap into two aspects. On one hand, general-purpose LMMs lack cognition of defects in the visual modality, thereby failing to sufficiently focus on defect areas. Therefore, we propose to modify the AnyRes structure of the LLaVA model, providing the potential anomalous areas identified by existing IAD models to the LMMs. On the other hand, existing methods mainly focus on identifying defects by learning defect patterns or comparing with normal samples, yet they fall short of understanding the causes of these defects. Considering that the generation of defects is closely related to the manufacturing process, we propose a manufacturing-driven IAD paradigm. An instruction-tuning dataset for IAD (InstructIAD) and a data organization approach for Chain-of-Thought with manufacturing (CoT-M) are designed to leverage the manufacturing process for IAD. Based on the above two modifications, we present Triad, a novel LMM-based method incorporating an expert-guided region-of-interest tokenizer and manufacturing process for industrial anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show that our Triad not only demonstrates competitive performance against current LMMs but also achieves further improved accuracy when equipped with manufacturing processes. Source code, training data, and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/tzjtatata/Triad.

<title>SketchSplat: 3D Edge Reconstruction via Differentiable Multi-view Sketch Splatting</title>

Abstract: Edges are one of the most basic parametric primitives to describe structural information in 3D. In this paper, we study parametric 3D edge reconstruction from calibrated multi-view images. Previous methods usually reconstruct a 3D edge point set from multi-view 2D edge images, and then fit 3D edges to the point set. However, noise in the point set may cause gaps among fitted edges, and the recovered edges may not align with input multi-view images since the edge fitting depends only on the reconstructed 3D point set. To mitigate these problems, we propose SketchSplat, a method to reconstruct accurate, complete, and compact 3D edges via differentiable multi-view sketch splatting. We represent 3D edges as sketches, which are parametric lines and curves defined by attributes including control points, scales, and opacity. During reconstruction, we iteratively sample Gaussian points from a set of sketches and rasterize the Gaussians onto 2D edge images. Then the gradient of the image loss can be back-propagated to optimize the sketch attributes. Our method bridges 2D edge images and 3D edges in a differentiable manner, which ensures that 3D edges align well with 2D images and leads to accurate and complete results. We also propose a series of adaptive topological operations to reduce redundant edges and apply them along with the sketch optimization, yielding a more compact reconstruction. Finally, we contribute an accurate 2D edge detector that improves the performance of both ours and existing methods. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, completeness, and compactness on a benchmark CAD dataset.

Abstract: A common dilemma while photographing a scene is whether to capture it at a wider angle, allowing more of the scene to be covered but in less detail or to click in a narrow angle that captures better details but leaves out portions of the scene. We propose a novel method in this paper that infuses wider shots with finer quality details that is usually associated with an image captured by the primary lens by capturing the same scene using both narrow and wide field of view (FoV) lenses. We do so by training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model to learn to extract the visual quality parameters from a narrow-angle shot and to transfer these to the corresponding wide-angle image of the scene using residual connections and an attention-based fusion module. We have mentioned in details the proposed technique to isolate the visual essence of an image and to transfer it into another image. We have also elaborately discussed our implementation details and have presented the results of evaluation over several benchmark datasets and comparisons with contemporary advancements in the field.

<title>Masked Autoencoder Self Pre-Training for Defect Detection in Microelectronics</title>

Abstract: While transformers have surpassed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various computer vision tasks, microelectronics defect detection still largely relies on CNNs. We hypothesize that this gap is due to the fact that a) transformers have an increased need for data and b) (labelled) image generation procedures for microelectronics are costly, and data is therefore sparse. Whereas in other domains, pre-training on large natural image datasets can mitigate this problem, in microelectronics transfer learning is hindered due to the dissimilarity of domain data and natural images. We address this challenge through self pre-training, where models are pre-trained directly on the target dataset, rather than another dataset. We propose a resource-efficient vision transformer (ViT) pre-training framework for defect detection in microelectronics based on masked autoencoders (MAE). We perform pre-training and defect detection using a dataset of less than 10,000 scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) images. Our experimental results show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains compared to a) supervised ViT, b) ViT pre-trained on natural image datasets, and c) state-of-the-art CNN-based defect detection models used in microelectronics. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals that our self pre-trained models attend to defect-relevant features such as cracks in the solder material, while baseline models often attend to spurious patterns. This shows that our approach yields defect-specific feature representations, resulting in more interpretable and generalizable transformer models for this data-sparse domain.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore how conventional image enhancement can improve model robustness in medical image analysis. By applying commonly used normalization methods to images from various vendors and studying their influence on model generalization in transfer learning, we show that the nonlinear characteristics of domain-specific image dynamics cannot be addressed by simple linear transforms. To tackle this issue, we reformulate the image harmonization task as an exposure correction problem and propose a method termed Global Deep Curve Estimation (GDCE) to reduce domain-specific exposure mismatch. GDCE performs enhancement via a pre-defined polynomial function and is trained with a "domain discriminator", aiming to improve model transparency in downstream tasks compared to existing black-box methods.

Abstract: A solar panel harvests the most energy when pointing in the direction that maximizes the total illumination (irradiance) falling on it. Given an arbitrary panel orientation and an arbitrary environmental illumination, we address the problem of finding the direction of maximum total irradiance. We develop a minimal sensing approach where measurements from just four photodetectors are used to iteratively vary the tilt of the panel to maximize the irradiance. Many environments produce irradiance functions with multiple local maxima. As a result, simply measuring the gradient of the irradiance function and applying gradient ascent will not work. We show that a larger, optimized tilt between the detectors and the panel is equivalent to blurring the irradiance function. This has the effect of eliminating local maxima and turning the irradiance function into a unimodal one, whose maximum can be found using gradient ascent. We show that there is a close relationship between our approach and scale space theory. We collected a large dataset of high-dynamic range lighting environments in Manhattan, called UrbanSky. We use this dataset to conduct simulations to verify the robustness of our approach. Next, we simulate the energy harvested using our approach under dynamic illumination. Finally, we built a portable solar panel with four compact detectors and an actuator to conduct experiments in various real-world settings: direct sunlight, cloudy sky, urban settings with occlusions and shadows, and complex indoor lighting. In all cases, we show improvements in harvested energy compared to standard approaches for orienting a solar panel.

Abstract: This paper presents SPIE: a novel approach for semantic and structural post-training of instruction-based image editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in alignment with user prompts and consistency with input images. We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the alignment with instructions and realism in two ways. First, SPIE captures fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. Second, it achieves precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIE can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where targeted image edits enhance the visual realism of simulated environments, which improves their utility as proxy for real-world settings.

Abstract: In human-centered environments such as restaurants, homes, and warehouses, robots often face challenges in accurately recognizing 3D objects. These challenges stem from the complexity and variability of these environments, including diverse object shapes. In this paper, we propose a novel Lightweight Multi-modal Multi-view Convolutional-Vision Transformer network (LM-MCVT) to enhance 3D object recognition in robotic applications. Our approach leverages the Globally Entropy-based Embeddings Fusion (GEEF) method to integrate multi-views efficiently. The LM-MCVT architecture incorporates pre- and mid-level convolutional encoders and local and global transformers to enhance feature extraction and recognition accuracy. We evaluate our method on the synthetic ModelNet40 dataset and achieve a recognition accuracy of 95.6% using a four-view setup, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. To further validate its effectiveness, we conduct 5-fold cross-validation on the real-world OmniObject3D dataset using the same configuration. Results consistently show superior performance, demonstrating the method's robustness in 3D object recognition across synthetic and real-world 3D data.

Abstract: Visual recognition relies on understanding both the semantics of image tokens and the complex interactions among them. Mainstream self-attention methods, while effective at modeling global pair-wise relations, fail to capture high-order associations inherent in real-world scenes and often suffer from redundant computation. Hypergraphs extend conventional graphs by modeling high-order interactions and offer a promising framework for addressing these limitations. However, existing hypergraph neural networks typically rely on static and hard hyperedge assignments, leading to excessive and redundant hyperedges with hard binary vertex memberships that overlook the continuity of visual semantics. To overcome these issues, we present Soft Hypergraph Neural Networks (SoftHGNNs), which extend the methodology of hypergraph computation, to make it truly efficient and versatile in visual recognition tasks. Our framework introduces the concept of soft hyperedges, where each vertex is associated with hyperedges via continuous participation weights rather than hard binary assignments. This dynamic and differentiable association is achieved by using the learnable hyperedge prototype. Through similarity measurements between token features and the prototype, the model generates semantically rich soft hyperedges. SoftHGNN then aggregates messages over soft hyperedges to capture high-order semantics. To further enhance efficiency when scaling up the number of soft hyperedges, we incorporate a sparse hyperedge selection mechanism that activates only the top-k important hyperedges, along with a load-balancing regularizer to ensure balanced hyperedge utilization. Experimental results across three tasks on five datasets demonstrate that SoftHGNN efficiently captures high-order associations in visual scenes, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance on multimodal tasks but often suffer from hallucination, and confidently describe objects or attributes not present in the image. Current training-free interventions struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding guided by the model's confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form generations, effectively reducing hallucination.

Abstract: Story visualization aims to generate coherent image sequences that faithfully depict a narrative and align with character references. Despite progress in generative models, existing benchmarks are narrow in scope, often limited to short prompts, no character reference, or single-image cases, and fall short of real-world storytelling complexity. This hinders a nuanced understanding of model capabilities and limitations. We present ViStoryBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate story visualization models across diverse narrative structures, visual styles, and character settings. The benchmark features richly annotated multi-shot scripts derived from curated stories spanning literature, film, and folklore. Large language models assist in story summarization and script generation, with all outputs verified by humans to ensure coherence and fidelity. Character references are carefully curated to maintain intra-story consistency across varying artistic styles. To enable thorough evaluation, ViStoryBench introduces a set of automated metrics that assess character consistency, style similarity, prompt adherence, aesthetic quality, and generation artifacts such as copy-paste behavior. These metrics are validated through human studies, and used to benchmark a broad range of open-source and commercial models. ViStoryBench offers a high-fidelity, multi-dimensional evaluation suite that facilitates systematic analysis and fosters future progress in visual storytelling.

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generation have shown promising results, yet existing approaches struggle with scene-consistent memory capabilities in long video generation due to limited use of historical context. In this work, we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during training.

Abstract: Foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong generalization capabilities due to large-scale pretraining on diverse image-text pairs. However, their performance often degrades when applied to target datasets with significant distribution shifts in both visual appearance and class semantics. Recent few-shot learning approaches adapt CLIP to downstream tasks using limited labeled data via adapter or prompt tuning, but are not specifically designed to handle such extreme domain shifts. Conversely, some works addressing cross-domain few-shot learning consider such domain-shifted scenarios but operate in an episodic setting with only a few classes per episode, limiting their applicability to real-world deployment, where all classes must be handled simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, MIST (Multiple Stochastic Prompt Tuning), for efficiently adapting CLIP to datasets with extreme distribution shifts using only a few labeled examples, in scenarios involving all classes at once. Specifically, we introduce multiple learnable prompts per class to effectively capture diverse modes in visual representations arising from distribution shifts. To further enhance generalization, these prompts are modeled as learnable Gaussian distributions, enabling efficient exploration of the prompt parameter space and reducing overfitting caused by limited supervision. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine search strategy to enable flexible control over accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and ensure robust matching even between descriptors from different image types. This approach allows HypeVPR to outperform existing methods while significantly accelerating retrieval and reducing database storage requirements. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

Abstract: Many studies have been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for the further processing required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a polygonal approximation was the figure of merit. Later,it was noted that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason which is why Rosin-through mathematical analysis-introduced a measure called merit. However,this measure involves an optimal scheme of polygonal approximation,so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of fit of an approximation. This led many researchers to use a weighted figure of merit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare sub optimal schemes. An attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures-weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure-are related so that one can be used instead of the other, and toward this end, theoretical analysis, experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The mathematical formulas for the weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are analyzed, and through proof of theorems,it is found that the two measures are theoretically independent of each other. The graphical analysis of experiments carried out using a public dataset supports the results of the theoretical analysis. The statistical analysis via Pearson's correlation coefficient and non-linear correlation measure also revealed that the two measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a suboptimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other suboptimal scheme,as indicated by Rosin's measure,then the same conclusion cannot be drawn using a weighted figure of merit,so one cannot use a weighted figure of merit instead of Rosin's measure.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts -- where missed cues can stereotype communities and undermine usability. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit (stated) as well as implicit (unstated, implied by the prompt's cultural context) cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we show that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, provide a concrete testbed, and outline actionable directions for developing culturally informed T2I models and metrics that improve global usability.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However, challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function, enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46, highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically, we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data, which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics). Our code is available at https://github.com/WangLY136/MUG.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This "seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust, multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities, significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data, necessitating sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it should autonomously explore and construct its own inference paths, rather than being confined to predefined ground-truth sequences. Ideally, its architecture ought to be unified yet generalized, possessing capabilities to perform diverse reasoning tasks through one model without requiring additional fine-tuning. Existing remote sensing approaches rely on supervised fine-tuning paradigms and task-specific heads, limiting both autonomous reasoning and unified generalization. To this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a unified workflow for geospatial reasoning. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing targets, together with task transformation strategies that enable multi-granularity tasks, including object-, region-, and pixel-level. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient reasoning autonomy. At the inference stage, our transformation strategies enable diverse task output formats without requiring task-specific decoders or further fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrated that RemoteReasoner achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multi-granularity reasoning tasks. Furthermore, it retains the MLLM's inherent generalization capability, demonstrating robust performance on unseen tasks and out-of-distribution categories.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection. In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs, underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

<title>Half-Physics: Enabling Kinematic 3D Human Model with Physical Interactions</title>

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result, kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics. Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating physical interactions

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language. Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval, when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

<title>A Data-driven Loss Weighting Scheme across Heterogeneous Tasks for Image Denoising</title>

Abstract: In a variational denoising model, weight in the data fidelity term plays the role of enhancing the noise-removal capability. It is profoundly correlated with noise information, while also balancing the data fidelity and regularization terms. However, the difficulty of assigning weight is expected to be substantial when the noise pattern is beyond independent identical Gaussian distribution, e.g., impulse noise, stripe noise, or a mixture of several patterns, etc. Furthermore, how to leverage weight to balance the data fidelity and regularization terms is even less evident. In this work, we propose a data-driven loss weighting (DLW) scheme to address these issues. Specifically, DLW trains a parameterized weight function (i.e., a neural network) that maps the noisy image to the weight. The training is achieved by a bilevel optimization framework, where the lower level problem is solving several denoising models with the same weight predicted by the weight function and the upper level problem minimizes the distance between the restored image and the clean image. In this way, information from both the noise and the regularization can be efficiently extracted to determine the weight function. DLW also facilitates the easy implementation of a trained weight function on denoising models. Numerical results verify the remarkable performance of DLW on improving the ability of various variational denoising models to handle different complex noise. This implies that DLW has the ability to transfer the noise knowledge at the model level to heterogeneous tasks beyond the training ones and the generalization theory underlying DLW is studied, validating its intrinsic transferability.

Abstract: Cross-modal augmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and microscopic imaging based on the same tissue samples is promising because it can allow histopathological analysis in the absence of an underlying invasive biopsy procedure. Here, we tested a method for generating microscopic histological images from MRI scans of the human corpus callosum using conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) architecture. To our knowledge, this is the first multimodal translation of the brain MRI to histological volumetric representation of the same sample. The technique was assessed by training paired image translation models taking sets of images from MRI scans and microscopy. The use of cGAN for this purpose is challenging because microscopy images are large in size and typically have low sample availability. The current work demonstrates that the framework reliably synthesizes histology images from MRI scans of corpus callosum, emphasizing the network's ability to train on high resolution histologies paired with relatively lower-resolution MRI scans. With the ultimate goal of avoiding biopsies, the proposed tool can be used for educational purposes.

Abstract: Surface cracks in infrastructure can lead to severe deterioration and expensive maintenance if not efficiently repaired. Manual repair methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and imprecise. While advancements in robotic perception and manipulation have progressed autonomous crack repair, three key challenges remain: accurate localization in the robot's coordinate frame, adaptability to varying crack sizes, and realistic validation of repairs. We present an adaptive, autonomous robotic system for surface crack detection and repair using advanced sensing technologies to enhance precision and safety for humans. A laser scanner is used to refine crack coordinates for accurate localization. Furthermore, our adaptive crack filling approach outperforms fixed speed techniques in efficiency and consistency. We validate our method using 3D printed cracks under realistic conditions, demonstrating repeatable testing. This research contributes to the field of human-robot interaction by reducing manual labor, improving safety, and streamlining maintenance operations, ultimately paving the way for more sophisticated and integrated construction robotics.

Abstract: The need for improved diagnostic methods in ophthalmology is acute, especially in the underdeveloped regions with limited access to specialists and advanced equipment. Therefore, we introduce VisionUnite, a novel vision-language foundation model for ophthalmology enhanced with clinical knowledge. VisionUnite has been pretrained on an extensive dataset comprising 1.24 million image-text pairs, and further refined using our proposed MMFundus dataset, which includes 296,379 high-quality fundus image-text pairs and 889,137 simulated doctor-patient dialogue instances. Our experiments indicate that VisionUnite outperforms existing generative foundation models such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro. It also demonstrates diagnostic capabilities comparable to junior ophthalmologists. VisionUnite performs well in various clinical scenarios including open-ended multi-disease diagnosis, clinical explanation, and patient interaction, making it a highly versatile tool for initial ophthalmic disease screening. VisionUnite can also serve as an educational aid for junior ophthalmologists, accelerating their acquisition of knowledge regarding both common and underrepresented ophthalmic conditions. VisionUnite represents a significant advancement in ophthalmology, with broad implications for diagnostics, medical education, and understanding of disease mechanisms.

<title>From Pixels to Tokens: Revisiting Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) are a significant challenge, i.e., generating objects that are not presented in the visual input, which impairs their reliability. Recent studies often attribute hallucinations to a lack of understanding of visual input, yet ignore a more fundamental issue: the model's inability to effectively extract or decouple visual features. In this paper, we revisit the hallucinations in LVLMs from an architectural perspective, investigating whether the primary cause lies in the visual encoder (feature extraction) or the modal alignment module (feature decoupling). Motivated by our findings on the preliminary investigation, we propose a novel tuning strategy, PATCH, to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. This plug-and-play method can be integrated into various LVLMs, utilizing adaptive virtual tokens to extract object features from bounding boxes, thereby addressing hallucinations caused by insufficient decoupling of visual features. PATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple multi-modal hallucination datasets. We hope this approach provides researchers with deeper insights into the underlying causes of hallucinations in LVLMs, fostering further advancements and innovation in this field.

Abstract: Generalizing vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents to novel environments remains a difficult and open challenge. Current trends are to collect large-scale datasets or use data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve downstream generalization. However, the computational and data collection costs increase exponentially with the number of task variations and can destabilize the already difficult task of training RL agents. In this work, we take inspiration from recent advances in computational neuroscience and propose a model, Associative Latent DisentAnglement (ALDA), that builds on standard off-policy RL towards zero-shot generalization. Specifically, we revisit the role of latent disentanglement in RL and show how combining it with a model of associative memory achieves zero-shot generalization on difficult task variations without relying on data augmentation. Finally, we formally show that data augmentation techniques are a form of weak disentanglement and discuss the implications of this insight.

<title>Gotta Hear Them All: Towards Sound Source Aware Audio Generation</title>

Abstract: Audio synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs describing an audio scene, such as images or texts. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware Audio (SS2A) generator. SS2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to clearly measure localized audio relevance. With the effectiveness of explicit sound source modeling, SS2A achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive image-to-audio tasks. We also qualitatively demonstrate SS2A's ability to achieve intuitive synthesis control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Furthermore, we show that our sound source modeling can achieve competitive video-to-audio performance with a straightforward temporal aggregation mechanism.

Abstract: We introduce UnrealZoo, a collection of over 100 photo-realistic 3D virtual worlds built on Unreal Engine, designed to reflect the complexity and variability of open-world environments. We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Body composition assessment using CT images can potentially be used for a number of clinical applications, including the prognostication of cardiovascular outcomes, evaluation of metabolic health, monitoring of disease progression, assessment of nutritional status, prediction of treatment response in oncology, and risk stratification for surgical and critical care outcomes. While multiple groups have developed in-house segmentation tools for this analysis, there are very limited publicly available tools that could be consistently used across different applications. To mitigate this gap, we present a publicly accessible, end-to-end segmentation and feature calculation model specifically for CT body composition analysis. Our model performs segmentation of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) across the chest, abdomen, and pelvis area in axial CT images. It also provides various body composition metrics, including muscle density, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat (VAT/SAT) ratio, muscle area/volume, and skeletal muscle index (SMI), supporting both 2D and 3D assessments. To evaluate the model, the segmentation was applied to both internal and external datasets, with body composition metrics analyzed across different age, sex, and race groups. The model achieved high dice coefficients on both internal and external datasets, exceeding 89% for skeletal muscle, SAT, and VAT segmentation. The model outperforms the benchmark by 2.40% on skeletal muscle and 10.26% on SAT compared to the manual annotations given by the publicly available dataset. Body composition metrics show mean relative absolute errors (MRAEs) under 10% for all measures. Furthermore, the model provided muscular fat segmentation with a Dice coefficient of 56.27%, which can be utilized for additional analyses as needed.

Abstract: Functional dexterous grasping requires precise hand-object interaction, going beyond simple gripping. Existing affordance-based methods primarily predict coarse interaction regions and cannot directly constrain the grasping posture, leading to a disconnection between visual perception and manipulation. To address this issue, we propose a multi-keypoint affordance representation for functional dexterous grasping, which directly encodes task-driven grasp configurations by localizing functional contact points. Our method introduces Contact-guided Multi-Keypoint Affordance (CMKA), leveraging human grasping experience images for weak supervision combined with Large Vision Models for fine affordance feature extraction, achieving generalization while avoiding manual keypoint annotations. Additionally, we present a Keypoint-based Grasp matrix Transformation (KGT) method, ensuring spatial consistency between hand keypoints and object contact points, thus providing a direct link between visual perception and dexterous grasping actions. Experiments on public real-world FAH datasets, IsaacGym simulation, and challenging robotic tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves affordance localization accuracy, grasp consistency, and generalization to unseen tools and tasks, bridging the gap between visual affordance learning and dexterous robotic manipulation. The source code and demo videos are publicly available at https://github.com/PopeyePxx/MKA.

arXiv:2503.12926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), multimodal understanding applications are emerging. As most LMM inference requests originate from edge devices with limited computational capabilities, the predominant inference pipeline involves directly forwarding the input data to an edge server which handles all computations. However, this approach introduces high transmission latency due to limited uplink bandwidth of edge devices and significant computation latency caused by the prohibitive number of visual tokens, thus hindering delay-sensitive tasks and degrading user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a task-oriented feature compression (TOFC) method for multimodal understanding in a device-edge co-inference framework, where visual features are merged by clustering and encoded by a learnable and selective entropy model before feature projection. Specifically, we employ density peaks clustering based on K nearest neighbors to reduce the number of visual features, thereby minimizing both data transmission and computational complexity. Subsequently, a learnable entropy model with hyperprior is utilized to encode and decode merged features, further reducing transmission overhead. To enhance compression efficiency, multiple entropy models are adaptively selected based on the characteristics of the visual features, enabling a more accurate estimation of the probability distribution. Comprehensive experiments on seven visual question answering benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFC method. Results show that TOFC achieves up to 52% reduction in data transmission overhead and 63% reduction in system latency while maintaining identical task performance, compared with neural compression ELIC.

Abstract: Light emission from galaxies exhibit diverse brightness profiles, influenced by factors such as galaxy type, structural features and interactions with other galaxies. Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.

Abstract: Existing reasoning evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) predominantly assess either text-based reasoning or vision-language understanding capabilities, with limited dynamic interplay between textual and visual constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CrossWordBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles -- a task requiring multimodal adherence to semantic constraints from text-based clues and intersectional constraints from visual grid structures. CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in two formats (text and image), supports adjustable difficulty through prefill ratio control, and offers different evaluation strategies, ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs substantially outperform non-reasoning models by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings highlight limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).

Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has revolutionised Super-Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure compared to conventional SR methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only 13% of training data is required to achieve performance similar to SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning by improving accuracy and efficiency, enhancing process understanding, and broadening applications to scientific research. We publicly release the complete source code of PC-SRGAN and all experiments at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/PC-SRGAN.

<title>A Fast Unsupervised Scheme for Polygonal Approximation</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for the polygonal approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is competitive with Rosin's measure and aesthetic aspects. The scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex insertion, iterative merging, and vertex adjustment. The initial segmentation is used to detect sharp turns, that is, vertices that seemingly have high curvature. It is likely that some of the important vertices with low curvature might have been missed in the first phase; therefore, iterative vertex insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices, and thus merging is used to eliminate redundant vertices. Finally, vertex adjustment was used to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the approximation. The quality of the approximations was measured using the Rosin's method. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric transformation was observed.

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel approach to unsupervised document clustering by leveraging multimodal embeddings as input to clustering algorithms such as $k$-Means, DBSCAN, a combination of HDBSCAN and $k$-NN, and BIRCH. Our method aims to achieve a finer-grained document understanding by not only grouping documents at the type level (e.g., invoices, purchase orders), but also distinguishing between different templates within the same document category. This is achieved by using embeddings that capture textual content, layout information, and visual features of documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using embeddings generated by several state-of-the-art pre-trained multimodal models, including SBERT, LayoutLMv1, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Donut, ColPali, Gemma3, and InternVL3. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal embeddings to significantly enhance document clustering, offering benefits for various applications in intelligent document processing, document layout analysis, and unsupervised document classification. This work provides valuable insight into the advantages and limitations of different multimodal models for this task and opens new avenues for future research to understand and organize document collections.

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Abstract: This demonstration paper presents $\mathbf{LayLens}$, a tool aimed to make deepfake understanding easier for users of all educational backgrounds. While prior works often rely on outputs containing technical jargon, LayLens bridges the gap between model reasoning and human understanding through a three-stage pipeline: (1) explainable deepfake detection using a state-of-the-art forgery localization model, (2) natural language simplification of technical explanations using a vision-language model, and (3) visual reconstruction of a plausible original image via guided image editing. The interface presents both technical and layperson-friendly explanations in addition to a side-by-side comparison of the uploaded and reconstructed images. A user study with 15 participants shows that simplified explanations significantly improve clarity and reduce cognitive load, with most users expressing increased confidence in identifying deepfakes. LayLens offers a step toward transparent, trustworthy, and user-centric deepfake forensics.

arXiv:2507.20034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying (FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a verification and validation (V&amp;V) process that bridges simulation and real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified, end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

Recent advancements in computational pathology have led to the development of patch-level Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, these models face limitations in analyzing whole slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and may miss crucial morphological features essential for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, a novel framework called WSI-LLaVA is introduced, designed for gigapixel WSI understanding. It includes a three-stage training approach, specialized WSI metrics (WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance), and focuses on morphological analysis for improved diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that WSI-LLaVA surpasses existing models in all capability dimensions and highlights the importance of morphological understanding in diagnostic accuracy. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in computational pathology have produced patch-level Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), but these models are limited by their inability to analyze whole slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and their tendency to bypass crucial morphological features that pathologists rely on for diagnosis. To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.

Summary:<br />
SNARM is a novel framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that utilizes self-referential learning within test images. It enhances anomaly discrimination by comparing test patches with adaptively selected in-image references. The method computes inter-residuals features by contrasting test image patches with a training feature bank. Self-generated reference patches with small-norm residuals are used to compute intra-residuals, amplifying discriminative signals. These features are fed into a Mamba module with multiple heads, dynamically navigated by residual properties. Results are obtained by aggregating the outputs in an ensemble learning paradigm. SNARM achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, showing notable improvements in all metrics including Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.<br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages ``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions. Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD, MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Summary:
Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP) is proposed as a solution for the challenges faced in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to Video Question Answering. Excessive frames can degrade performance due to context dilution, while keyframe selection methods still yield temporal redundancy termed 'visual echoes.' AFP intelligently prunes selected keyframes using adaptive hierarchical clustering and merges visual echoes into single representatives. A lightweight, text-based semantic graph is introduced to compensate for information loss with minimal token overhead. Extensive experiments show a drastic reduction in required frames and total input tokens, enhancing efficiency and often improving accuracy over baselines using more frames. The code for AFP will be released upon publication. <br /><br />Summary: Adaptive Frame-Pruning tackles challenges in MLLMs for Video Question Answering with intelligent frame selection and a semantic graph, leading to efficiency improvements and enhanced accuracy over baselines. <div>

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution. Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective, still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon publication.

Summary:<br />
The article explores demographic bias in generated objects, using the SODA framework to analyze biases in objects generated with demographic cues compared to neutral prompts. The study involved 2,700 images from three advanced models across five object categories. Results revealed strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, highlighting recurring color patterns linked to gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns not only reinforce known stereotypes but also uncover subtle biases. Some models were found to produce less diverse outputs, exacerbating visual disparities when compared to neutral prompts. The proposed auditing framework serves as a vital tool in identifying and addressing embedded stereotypes in generative models, aiming for a more responsible development of AI systems.<br />

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

<div> Keywords: 3D scene reconstruction, semantic understanding, multi-view images, Cross-View Transformer, unified representation

Summary:
Uni3R introduces a novel framework for reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. The approach called Uni3R integrates semantic understanding with reconstruction, providing a scalable and generalizable solution. By utilizing a Cross-View Transformer, Uni3R can effectively integrate information from multi-view inputs to regress a unified 3D scene representation enriched with open-vocabulary semantics. This representation enables high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, and depth prediction in a single feed-forward pass. Extensive experiments show that Uni3R achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. The code for Uni3R is publicly available, allowing for further research and development in this area.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/Uni3R.

Abstract: Fiducial markers are widely used in various robotics tasks, facilitating enhanced navigation, object recognition, and scene understanding. Despite their advantages for robots and Augmented Reality (AR) applications, they often disrupt the visual aesthetics of environments because they are visible to humans, making them unsuitable for non-intrusive use cases. To address this gap, this paper presents "iMarkers"-innovative, unobtrusive fiducial markers detectable exclusively by robots equipped with specialized sensors. These markers offer high flexibility in production, allowing customization of their visibility range and encoding algorithms to suit various demands. The paper also introduces the hardware designs and software algorithms developed for detecting iMarkers, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in the detection and recognition stages. Various evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of iMarkers compared to conventional (printed) and blended fiducial markers and confirmed their applicability in diverse robotics scenarios.

arXiv:2508.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs) has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks. However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding, extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost. Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/Rakesh-123-cryp/Med-GRIM.git

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces DiTalker, a framework for portrait animation that focuses on lip synchronization and dynamic speaking styles. It utilizes a Style-Emotion Encoding Module to extract style and emotion information separately, enhancing control over speaking styles. An Audio-Style Fusion Module is introduced to guide the animation process by decoupling audio and speaking styles. Optimization constraints are used to improve lip synchronization and preserve identity and background details. DiTalker outperforms existing methods in terms of lip synchronization and controllability of speaking styles. The project page provides further details and results. <div>
arXiv:2508.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses), while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker, a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g., head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers, using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page: https://thenameishope.github.io/DiTalker/

<div> Keywords: social media, muscle dysmorphia, pro-bigorexia, TikTok, multimodal dataset.

Summary:<br /><br />Social media platforms face challenges in detecting harmful pro-bigorexia content that targets adolescent males. This content often masquerades as fitness material, making it difficult to identify using traditional methods focused on thin ideal detection. To address this issue, the study introduces BigTokDetect, a detection framework designed specifically for identifying pro-bigorexia content on TikTok. The framework utilizes a multimodal dataset called BigTok, consisting of over 2,200 TikTok videos categorized by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. By evaluating state-of-the-art vision language models, the framework achieves high accuracy in classifying primary and subcategories of harmful content. The study demonstrates the importance of multimodal fusion in improving detection performance, with video features playing a crucial role. These findings set new benchmarks for harmful content detection and offer valuable computational tools for scalable content moderation in mental health domains.

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise, supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in specialized mental health domains.

<div> Keywords: polyp segmentation, semi-supervised learning, frequency prior, augmentation, cross-domain generalization<br />
Summary:<br />
- Automated polyp segmentation is crucial for early detection of colorectal cancer, but robust models face challenges due to limited annotated data and performance degradation under domain shift.
- Existing semi-supervised learning methods lack polyp-specific structural properties in their augmentations, leading to poor generalization across different imaging centers and devices.
- The Frequency Prior Guided Matching (FPGM) augmentation framework addresses this issue by leveraging the consistent frequency signature of polyp edges across diverse datasets.
- FPGM learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from labeled polyp edge regions and performs spectral perturbations on unlabeled images to align their amplitude spectra with the learned prior, enhancing cross-domain generalization.
- Validated on six public datasets, FPGM surpasses existing methods and demonstrates exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, achieving significant gains in Dice score in data-scarce scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift. Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements, existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching (FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets. FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure. Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under limited supervision.

<div> vision reflection, large multimodal models, explainability, visual recognition, language model

Summary:
Prompting a large multimodal model (LMM) to verify specialized vision model predictions can boost accuracy, even on ImageNet. Vision reflection within LMMs maps visual features to textual concepts, enabling reasoning with common sense. LMMs may lean more on distilled textual representations than raw vision features, as evidenced by successful answer generation with few text tokens replacing many vision tokens. A training-free connector can improve LMM performance in fine-grained recognition tasks without extensive alignment training. These findings shed light on vision-language model explainability and propose vision reflection as a viable approach for robust and interpretable visual recognition. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers, suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and interpretable visual recognition.

<div> Keywords: video-based behavior recognition, 3D CNN, Transformer, spatiotemporal features, long-range dependencies

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel hybrid framework for video-based behavior recognition, combining the strengths of 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. Traditional 3D CNNs are effective at capturing local spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. On the other hand, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but come with high computational costs. The proposed framework leverages the 3D CNN module to extract low-level features and the Transformer module to capture long-range temporal dependencies. A fusion mechanism is utilized to integrate both types of representations, leading to improved recognition accuracy on benchmark datasets. Ablation studies confirm the complementary strengths of the two modules, showcasing the effectiveness and scalability of the hybrid approach for video-based behavior recognition.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The 3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior recognition.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6 FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.

<title>What Makes "Good" Distractors for Object Hallucination Evaluation in Large Vision-Language Models?</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Vision-Language Models, Object Hallucination, POPE benchmark, Hallucination searching, LVLMs <br />

Summary: 
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), have made remarkable strides but still struggle with object hallucination. The Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation (POPE) benchmark, commonly used to assess this issue, has limitations in evaluating hallucination due to its simplistic sampling strategy lacking image-specific information. To address this, the Hallucination searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark is introduced, leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to generate misleading distractors and assess LVLMs' susceptibility to hallucination more rigorously. By incorporating content-aware and description-based hallucination searching, HOPE outperforms POPE in exposing hallucation vulnerabilities across various LVLMs. The code for HOPE is available on GitHub for further exploration and research.<br /> 
<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains. Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs, significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance, integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging human erasing benchmarks.

- The study explores using only multi-view RGB images for 3D semantic scene graph estimation when ground truth 3D annotations are not available.

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our project page is available at https://qixun1.github.io/projects/SCRSSG.

Summary: 
NNObfuscator is a novel utility control mechanism designed to enable deep learning models to dynamically adjust their performance based on predefined conditions. Unlike traditional methods that require separate models for different users, NNObfuscator allows a single model to be customized in real time, providing controlled access to varying levels of performance. This approach enhances resource allocation efficiency, reduces unnecessary computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. Experimental validation across tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation using popular models like ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN, and Stable Diffusion demonstrated the effectiveness of NNObfuscator in making models more versatile. With NNObfuscator, a single trained model can effectively handle a wide range of tasks without the need for extensive modifications or multiple versions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead, NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation, using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

Abstract: The advancement of intelligent agents has revolutionized problem-solving across diverse domains, yet solutions for personalized fashion styling remain underexplored, which holds immense promise for promoting shopping experiences. In this work, we present StyleTailor, the first collaborative agent framework that seamlessly unifies personalized apparel design, shopping recommendation, virtual try-on, and systematic evaluation into a cohesive workflow. To this end, StyleTailor pioneers an iterative visual refinement paradigm driven by multi-level negative feedback, enabling adaptive and precise user alignment. Specifically, our framework features two core agents, i.e., Designer for personalized garment selection and Consultant for virtual try-on, whose outputs are progressively refined via hierarchical vision-language model feedback spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy. Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop mechanism that enhances recommendation quality.To assess the performance, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite encompassing style consistency, visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.

<title>From Label Error Detection to Correction: A Modular Framework and Benchmark for Object Detection Datasets</title>

<div> Keywords: object detection, label errors, dataset quality, error correction, crowdsourcing  

Summary:  
The article introduces a semi-automated framework called REC$\checkmark$D for correcting label errors in object detection datasets. Label errors, such as missing labels or inaccurate localization, can significantly impact the quality of datasets and distort training outcomes and benchmark evaluations. REC$\checkmark$D pairs existing detectors with lightweight, crowd-sourced microtasks to verify candidate bounding boxes. The framework enables multiple annotators to independently verify each box, with their responses aggregated to improve label quality and estimate ambiguity. Applying REC$\checkmark$D to the pedestrian class in the KITTI dataset revealed at least 24% missing and inaccurate annotations. The corrected annotations, validated through crowdsourcing, will be released as a new benchmark for label error detection and correction. The framework can rapidly recover errors, surpassing human annotation speed. However, current methods still miss up to 66% of true errors, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels, incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released benchmark.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model. Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs (MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography (CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

<div> Image Encoder, Emotion Recognition, Multimodal Fusion, Visual Anchors, Cognitive Theories

Summary: 
This paper introduces Visual Emotion Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism for multimodal emotion recognition in conversations. The VEGA approach utilizes CLIP's image encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars. These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features towards a psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration from cognitive theories. A stochastic anchor sampling strategy is employed to balance semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, the VEGA-augmented model achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets. This method offers a novel approach to incorporating visually-grounded semantics into multimodal fusion for improved emotion recognition in conversations. The implementation code is available on GitHub for replication and further research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars. These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at: https://github.com/dkollias/VEGA.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel framework for integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports to enhance diagnosis in brain disorders. The framework aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared latent space at both subject and connectome levels. By treating brain subnetworks as tokens and aligning them with word tokens in clinical reports, the framework efficiently identifies system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and clinical observations. Applied to mild cognitive impairment using the ADNI dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance and identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs. This approach offers new insights into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supports the development of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains: how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

Summary: 
The study introduces Surformer v1, a transformer-based architecture for surface material recognition utilizing tactile features and visual embeddings. Initially focusing on tactile-only classification, a tailored encoder-only Transformer model achieved high accuracy and fast inference time. By incorporating vision and touch inputs in a multimodal fusion setup, Surformer v1 showed 99.4% accuracy with 0.77 ms inference time, outperforming the Multimodal CNN in terms of efficiency and computational cost. The results highlight Surformer v1 as a promising model for real-time applications, demonstrating a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost. <div>

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers, enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently, state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering, we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications. To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface material recognition.

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising 509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos, making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning framework for hate speech detection in videos.

In the second stage, we train cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations. Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets, ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem, which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this, we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide (Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis (83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1), surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations, bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator that does not rely on paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, this approach integrates diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for better coverage of the data distribution and improved cross-domain translation performance. The challenge lies in aligning the diffusion process (applied to noisy signals) with the translation process (applied to clean signals). To address this, the proposed joint learning framework aligns these processes, enhancing global optimality. By extracting image components with diffusion models and using a time-dependent translation network for complex mapping, the method achieves improved fidelity and structural consistency in tasks such as RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics, and RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth translations, outperforming existing methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result, recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models. To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes, enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the state of the arts.

Summary:
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view synthesis, but struggle with rendering scenes containing complex specular reflections and highlights. This work introduces a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient decomposition to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. The approach decomposes complex appearance into a static neural basis encoding material properties and dynamic coefficients generated by a Coefficient Network based on view and illumination. A Dynamic Radiance Integrator combines these components for final radiance synthesis, producing sharper and more realistic specular highlights compared to existing methods. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for modeling complex appearance in neural scene representations. The decomposition paradigm offers flexibility and effectiveness in capturing complex appearance in scenes.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in neural scene representations.

Summary:
CausalNet is proposed as a framework for robust Micro-expression recognition (MER) that effectively deals with key-frame index errors. By taking the entire ME sequence as input, CausalNet addresses the challenge of accurate key-frame indexes and achieves robust recognition. The Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) helps locate muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs), reducing attention to redundant areas. The Causal Attention Block (CAB) deeply learns causal relationships between muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CausalNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard MER benchmarks when using annotated key-frames. The model achieves robust MER under varying levels of key-frame index noise, showcasing its effectiveness in practical applications. The code for CausalNet is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes, while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition, first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs), thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile, it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames.

<div> Watermarking, Generated Content, In-generation, Autoregressive Image Models, Token-level<br />
Summary:<br />
This article explores in-generation watermarking for autoregressive image models, a field not previously researched. They adapt token-level watermarking schemes from large language models, finding they work in principle but are less detectable under image perturbations. To address this, two novel watermarking methods utilizing visual token clustering are proposed for improved robustness and image quality. The first method involves a training-free cluster lookup table, while the second involves finetuning VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly. These cluster-level watermarks demonstrate enhanced resistance against perturbations and regeneration attacks, with cluster classification enhancing watermark detectability beyond baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed methods offer fast verification runtime comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking techniques.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive (AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images. Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality. Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime, comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

<div> Keywords: computer vision, line drawings, pretraining, efficient visual understanding, compact representations

Summary:
In the study, the authors propose using line drawings for pretraining in computer vision to enhance visual understanding. They found that models pretrained on line drawings exhibit stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data efficiency across various tasks. Additionally, these models have lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring fewer principal components for representational variance capture. Pretraining with line drawings also leads to more compressible representations, allowing for better distillation into lightweight student models. The results show that students distilled from line-pretrained teachers outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers. Furthermore, the pretraining method can be extended to unsupervised learning using their proposed "learning to draw" approach. Overall, the findings suggest that structure-first visual learning promotes efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases, offering a valuable strategy for developing robust and adaptable vision systems.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance, underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably, these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance - echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers, highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision systems.

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence, the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks, has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset.

<div> Keywords: deformable 3D content, 4D scene synthesis, video-rewinding training, geometry consistency, motion quality <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Restage4D, a pipeline for reanimating deformable 3D scenes using real-world video motion priors. By leveraging a video-rewinding training strategy, Restage4D bridges a base video and a synthetic driving video to generate physically consistent 4D content. The approach includes an occlusion-aware rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to enhance geometry and structural consistency in challenging motion scenarios. Validation on DAVIS and PointOdyssey datasets shows improved geometry preservation, motion quality, and 3D tracking accuracy. Restage4D not only maintains deformable structure under new motion but also rectifies errors introduced by generative models, highlighting the potential of incorporating video priors in 4D scene synthesis tasks. The source code and trained models will be made publicly available for further research and applications in deformable 3D content generation and reanimation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis. In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised: \textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging task. Source code and trained models will be released.

Summary: 
The study introduces FoundBioNet, a deep learning model that uses multi-parametric MRI to predict IDH mutation status in glioma patients. The model incorporates Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) modules to extract tumor-focused features and highlight T2-FLAIR mismatch signals related to IDH mutation. Trained on a diverse dataset of 1705 patients from multiple centers, FoundBioNet achieved high AUCs on independent test sets, outperforming baseline methods. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of both TAFE and CMD modules in improving predictive accuracy. By combining large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet offers a generalizable approach to glioma characterization. This method enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, potentially enabling more personalized patient care. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity. While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets. Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized patient care.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new benchmark dataset called VOccl3D, which focuses on occlusions in human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods. Existing datasets lack realistic occlusion scenarios, prompting the development of this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques. The dataset includes diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and human motions. The authors fine-tuned HPS methods like CLIFF and BEDLAM-CLIFF on VOccl3D, which resulted in qualitative and quantitative improvements across various datasets. Additionally, they refined an object detector, YOLO11, to enhance human detection performance under occlusion. The dataset aims to serve as a valuable resource for benchmarking methods capable of handling occlusions, offering a more realistic alternative to current datasets. <div>
arXiv:2508.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied, with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g., most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques, incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions, offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

Summary:
DiffUS is a novel physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that transforms MRI 3D scans into realistic B-mode ultrasound images. The system utilizes machine learning to convert MRI scans into acoustic impedance volumes and simulates ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing. DiffUS efficiently captures wave propagation through a sparse linear system, enabling accurate reflection and transmission modeling. It reconstructs B-mode images considering speckle noise and depth-dependent degradation, providing anatomically accurate results. Implemented in PyTorch, DiffUS allows gradient-based optimization for various applications, such as registration and reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates the system's capability to bridge the gap between preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, enhancing surgical precision and efficiency.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts, and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next, we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain MRI data.

Summary:
Accurate localization of organ boundaries is crucial in medical imaging for various applications. While deep convolutional networks have improved edge detection in natural images, precise localization is often lacking, especially in medical images where high accuracy is required. This study introduces a specialized crisp edge detector that refines organ boundaries in medical images through a novel architecture. The method combines high-level semantic features with low-level cues to produce well-localized boundaries in 2D and 3D volumes. Evaluations on CT and MRI datasets show significant improvements in boundary localization compared to baseline detectors. Integrating the crisp edge maps leads to enhanced organ segmentation, improved image registration, and better lesion delineation near organ interfaces. The proposed approach provides clinically valuable organ edges, enhancing various medical imaging tasks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images (2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries. We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

arXiv:2508.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers, bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

<div> Framework, Weakly Supervised, Subcutaneous Vessel Segmentation, Label Propagation, Uncertainty Weighted Loss <br />
Summary: <br />
This article introduces a novel weakly supervised training framework for accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels in clinical images. It leverages sparse annotations that are expanded into dense, probabilistic supervision using a differentiable random walk label propagation model. The model incorporates vesselness cues and tubular continuity priors to produce per-pixel hitting probabilities with uncertainty estimates that are used in an uncertainty weighted loss function to prevent overfitting. The label-propagator is learned jointly with a CNN based segmentation predictor to discover vessel edges and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. A topology aware regularizer is also introduced to encourage centerline connectivity and penalize spurious branches. Experimental results show improved vessel segmentation compared to naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling, with better calibrated uncertainty for clinical decision making. This approach reduces annotation burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology. <div>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense, probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling, producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

Summary:
The paper introduces a source-free Adaptive Gated Experts (SAGE-reID) method for person re-identification. SAGE-reID is a multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) approach that outperforms conventional unsupervised domain adaptation methods. It first trains source-specific low-rank adapters through source-free UDA and then uses a lightweight gating network to dynamically merge these adapters for effective knowledge transfer. The method has a constant number of backbone parameters across source domains, reducing memory consumption and overfitting risk. Experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 datasets demonstrate SAGE-reID's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while being computationally efficient. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras), considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts (SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting geometric deviations in manufactured components using advanced 3D surface analysis. Despite progress in modern manufacturing, maintaining dimensional precision remains difficult, particularly for complex geometries. We present a methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling research.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in image captioning, generating accurate and descriptive captions remains a long-standing challenge. In this study, we propose Attention-Guided Image Captioning (AGIC), which amplifies salient visual regions directly in the feature space to guide caption generation. We further introduce a hybrid decoding strategy that combines deterministic and probabilistic sampling to balance fluency and diversity. To evaluate AGIC, we conduct extensive experiments on the Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets. The results show that AGIC matches or surpasses several state-of-the-art models while achieving faster inference. Moreover, AGIC demonstrates strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for image captioning.

<div> Keywords: Multiview clustering, joint sparse self-representation learning, cardinality constraints, low-rank constraint, alternating quadratic penalty method

Summary: 
Multiview clustering (MC) is a way to group samples using information from multiple perspectives. This paper introduces a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for MC, which utilizes cardinality constraints to extract view-specific local information. By incorporating these constraints, the model can capture reliable local and global structure information from each view. The proposed model also includes a low-rank constraint to reveal a coherent structure in the consensus affinity matrix. To address convergence challenges, an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method is developed with global convergence. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the AQP method compared to existing algorithms. Overall, this approach improves the generalization ability and performance of multiview clustering algorithms.

Abstract: Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view, cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability. To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art algorithms.

Summary: 
The article introduces Visual-Subtitle Integration (VSI), a method that enhances keyframe search accuracy in long video understanding tasks by integrating subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries. VSI employs a dual-stream search mechanism that captures visual and textual information through Video Search Stream and Subtitle Match Stream, resulting in improved keyframe localization accuracy on LongVideoBench and downstream Video-QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate a 40.00% accuracy on text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench and 68.48% accuracy on long Video-QA tasks, outperforming competitive baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. VSI also achieved state-of-the-art performance on medium-to-long video-QA tasks, showcasing its robustness and generalizability in multimodal search strategies. <div>

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream, respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00% key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed multimodal search strategy.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally, with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Summary:
- The paper addresses the challenge of infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) by proposing a noise-suppression feature pyramid network (NS-FPN).
- Traditional CNN-based methods focus on enhancing feature representation to combat noise, leading to increased false alarms.
- The NS-FPN integrates a low-frequency guided feature purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module to suppress noise features and enhance target-relevant features.

- Extensive experiments on public IRSTDS datasets show that the NS-FPN significantly reduces false alarms and outperforms existing methods on IRSTDS tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim, shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior performance on IRSTDS tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%. Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness (mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust, interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor classification, advancing the integration of deep learning into clinical neurodiagnostics.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces BASIC, a method that improves the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating direct visual supervision. This approach utilizes refined visual embeddings within the language model as supervision to guide the vision projector in generating initial visual embeddings. By optimizing embedding directions and improving semantic matching, BASIC enhances the alignment between visual and textual modalities in MLLMs. The method does not require additional supervisory models or artificial annotations, making it a practical and effective solution for enhancing visual comprehension in large language models. Experiments demonstrate that BASIC significantly improves MLLM performance across various benchmarks, highlighting the importance of direct visual supervision in enhancing the alignment of visual embeddings in multimodal models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

<div> Dataset, video emotion analysis, eMotions, AV-CANet, multimodal complexity <br />
Summary: <br />
Short-form videos (SVs) are popular for information sharing, but analyzing emotions in them is challenging due to their diverse content. A new dataset, eMotions, addresses this by providing full-scale annotations for 27,996 videos. The dataset is quality-controlled with a multi-stage annotation procedure and offers category-balanced and test-oriented variants. To analyze emotions in SVs effectively, AV-CANet, an audio-visual fusion network, is proposed. This network utilizes a video transformer to capture relevant representations and a Local-Global Fusion Module to correlate audio-visual features. The EP-CE Loss function guides optimization with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AV-CANet on multiple datasets. Ablation studies show the importance of the proposed components. Dataset and code will be available on Github, providing valuable insights for future research in video emotion analysis. <div>

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis (VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data, we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

<title>A Simple yet Powerful Instance-Aware Prompting Framework for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06904</link>

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings. While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2) \textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3) Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art training-free COS methods.

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references, combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However, current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs -- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references. We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990 synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33 reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation, abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images, textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem. Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning, instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710 multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing. Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large language models (LLMs), we propose AR-GRPO, an approach to integrate online RL training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines. Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics, establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis.

<title>CannyEdit: Selective Canny Control and Dual-Prompt Guidance for Training-Free Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits. We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2) Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for competitor methods.

<title>SLRTP2025 Sign Language Production Challenge: Methodology, Results, and Future Work</title>

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33 participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare their work against a broader range of methods.

<title>Beyond Frequency: Seeing Subtle Cues Through the Lens of Spatial Decomposition for Fine-Grained Visual Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06959</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor (SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

<title>Adversarial Video Promotion Against Text-to-Video Retrieval</title>

arXiv:2508.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval (T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined. Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries, i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially, dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement (MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously. We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/michaeltian108/ViPro.

<title>Evaluating Fisheye-Compatible 3D Gaussian Splatting Methods on Real Images Beyond 180 Degree Field of View</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06968</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06968</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180 degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200 degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view (200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200 degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and distortion-heavy image inputs.

Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD). However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task. The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather scenarios.

arXiv:2508.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring), dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives. Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming, we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks with different document types and degrees of distortion.

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs, pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos at once.

<title>S2-UniSeg: Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling for Scalable Segment Anything without Supervision</title>

arXiv:2508.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation. However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences. Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four benchmarks.

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare, particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in MS.

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task. However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat: a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details. Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature in PDF format necessitates advanced tools for efficient and accurate document understanding, summarization, and content optimization. Traditional methods fall short in handling complex layouts and multimodal content, while direct application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) lacks precision and control for intricate editing tasks. This paper introduces DocRefine, an innovative framework designed for intelligent understanding, content refinement, and automated summarization of scientific PDF documents, driven by natural language instructions. DocRefine leverages the power of advanced LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) by orchestrating a sophisticated multi-agent system comprising six specialized and collaborative agents: Layout & Structure Analysis, Multimodal Content Understanding, Instruction Decomposition, Content Refinement, Summarization & Generation, and Fidelity & Consistency Verification. This closed-loop feedback architecture ensures high semantic accuracy and visual fidelity. Evaluated on the comprehensive DocEditBench dataset, DocRefine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various tasks, achieving overall scores of 86.7% for Semantic Consistency Score (SCS), 93.9% for Layout Fidelity Index (LFI), and 85.0% for Instruction Adherence Rate (IAR). These results demonstrate DocRefine's superior capability in handling complex multimodal document editing, preserving semantic integrity, and maintaining visual consistency, marking a significant advancement in automated scientific document processing.

Abstract: Complex Visual Question Answering (Complex VQA) tasks, which demand sophisticated multi-modal reasoning and external knowledge integration, present significant challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) often limited by their reliance on high-level global features. To address this, we propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse visual and linguistic information. MV-CoRe meticulously integrates global embeddings from pre-trained Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Language Large Models (LLMs) with fine-grained semantic-aware visual features, including object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks, including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and reasoning depth, underscoring its robust capabilities for deep visual and conceptual understanding.

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted colonoscopy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However, these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT, or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time novel view synthesis with high visual fidelity, but its substantial storage requirements hinder practical deployment, prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods to incorporate compression modules. However, these 3DGS generative compression techniques introduce unique distortions lacking systematic quality assessment research. To this end, we establish 3DGS-VBench, a large-scale Video Quality Assessment (VQA) Dataset and Benchmark with 660 compressed 3DGS models and video sequences generated from 11 scenes across 6 SOTA 3DGS compression algorithms with systematically designed parameter levels. With annotations from 50 participants, we obtained MOS scores with outlier removal and validated dataset reliability. We benchmark 6 3DGS compression algorithms on storage efficiency and visual quality, and evaluate 15 quality assessment metrics across multiple paradigms. Our work enables specialized VQA model training for 3DGS, serving as a catalyst for compression and quality assessment research. The dataset is available at https://github.com/YukeXing/3DGS-VBench.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent 3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including (1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices, outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior performance even with limited slice data.

<title>TeSO: Representing and Compressing 3D Point Cloud Scenes with Textured Surfel Octree</title>

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D Gaussian-based baselines.

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view detection and forecasting models.

<title>Communication-Efficient Multi-Agent 3D Detection via Hybrid Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages: perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability, effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system. \texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements, and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than 2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50. The related code will be released.

<title>AugLift: Boosting Generalization in Lifting-based 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly improves generalization performance without requiring additional data collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models (e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$, while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However, questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities: Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets for AI diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks, leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components: (1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator (CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals.

<title>Dynamic Pattern Alignment Learning for Pretraining Lightweight Human-Centric Vision Models</title>

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher, DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M) and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions. Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion customization.

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However, this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations. These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types. Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study, we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures, with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks, including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis, thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its clinical applicability.

Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms state-of-the-art RVOS methods.

<title>Similarity Matters: A Novel Depth-guided Network for Image Restoration and A New Dataset</title>

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However, existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF) scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition, the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205 high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios. Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation, synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically, given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM, producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in real-world scenarios.

<title>Bridging Semantic Logic Gaps: A Cognition-Inspired Multimodal Boundary-Preserving Network for Image Manipulation Localization</title>

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information. We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally, inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder (RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience, and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination, hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods enhance resolution via H&amp;E-stained histology, but three major challenges persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&amp;E images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&amp;E images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation network to extract predictive cues from H&amp;E (ii) a spatial alignment module enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling. Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and gene-level coherence in high-resolution ST predictions.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years. Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions, skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly. To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor. Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the model's accuracy on unseen speakers.

<title>ASM-UNet: Adaptive Scan Mamba Integrating Group Commonalities and Individual Variations for Fine-Grained Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders, which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order, generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.

<title>Consistent and Controllable Image Animation with Motion Linear Diffusion Transformers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07246</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V) generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation. Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code, trained models and results will be publicly available via https://github.com/bearshng/suit to support reproducibility.

<title>Understanding Dynamic Scenes in Ego Centric 4D Point Clouds</title>

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses, globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable, step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained, multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding, and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

<title>Small-Large Collaboration: Training-efficient Concept Personalization for Large VLM using a Meta Personalized Small VLM</title>

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

arXiv:2508.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at https://haiv-lab.github.io/openhaiv .

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its generalizability and interpretive value.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work, we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead. Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning (SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL) settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released at https://github.com/Senyh/SynMatch.

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA) mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet) expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance. Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding 79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is available at https://github.com/maomao0819/BEVANet.

Abstract: Dragon fruit, renowned for its nutritional benefits and economic value, has experienced rising global demand due to its affordability and local availability. As dragon fruit cultivation expands, efficient pre- and post-harvest quality inspection has become essential for improving agricultural productivity and minimizing post-harvest losses. This study presents DragonFruitQualityNet, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for real-time quality assessment of dragon fruits on mobile devices. We curated a diverse dataset of 13,789 images, integrating self-collected samples with public datasets (dataset from Mendeley Data), and classified them into four categories: fresh, immature, mature, and defective fruits to ensure robust model training. The proposed model achieves an impressive 93.98% accuracy, outperforming existing methods in fruit quality classification. To facilitate practical adoption, we embedded the model into an intuitive mobile application, enabling farmers and agricultural stakeholders to conduct on-device, real-time quality inspections. This research provides an accurate, efficient, and scalable AI-driven solution for dragon fruit quality control, supporting digital agriculture and empowering smallholder farmers with accessible technology. By bridging the gap between research and real-world application, our work advances post-harvest management and promotes sustainable farming practices.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to equip AI systems with the ability to continuously acquire and adapt to new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information, similar to human learning. While traditional continual learning methods focusing on unimodal tasks have achieved notable success, the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models has brought increasing attention to Multimodal Continual Learning tasks involving multiple modalities, such as vision and language. In this setting, models are expected to not only mitigate catastrophic forgetting but also handle the challenges posed by cross-modal interactions and coordination. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce MCITlib, a comprehensive and constantly evolving code library for continual instruction tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models. In MCITlib, we have currently implemented 8 representative algorithms for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning and systematically evaluated them on 2 carefully selected benchmarks. MCITlib will be continuously updated to reflect advances in the Multimodal Continual Learning field. The codebase is released at https://github.com/Ghy0501/MCITlib.

Abstract: Efficient lightweight neural networks are with increasing attention due to their faster reasoning speed and easier deployment on mobile devices. However, existing video pre-trained models still focus on the common ViT architecture with high latency, and few works attempt to build efficient architecture on mobile devices. This paper bridges this gap by introducing temporal structural reparameterization into an efficient image-text model and training it on a large-scale high-quality video-text dataset, resulting in an efficient video-text model that can run on mobile devices with strong zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities, termed as MobileViCLIP. In particular, in terms of inference speed on mobile devices, our MobileViCLIP-Small is 55.4x times faster than InternVideo2-L14 and 6.7x faster than InternVideo2-S14. In terms of zero-shot retrieval performance, our MobileViCLIP-Small obtains similar performance as InternVideo2-L14 and obtains 6.9\% better than InternVideo2-S14 on MSR-VTT.

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs, its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework, Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

<title>RORPCap: Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image Captioning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5% CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an alternative for image captioning.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language, evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains. The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair, to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps, maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks: Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential, especially for complex prompts.

arXiv:2508.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code: https://github.com/KZF-kzf/CoAR

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at: https://github.com/frakenation/SODiff

<title>GS4Buildings: Prior-Guided Gaussian Splatting for 3D Building Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic 3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process, providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation. Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as smart cities and digital twins.

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models, revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of $512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and $4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than zero-shot methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method, obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla 3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US, a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features. Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models will be publicly available.

<title>ForensicsSAM: Toward Robust and Unified Image Forgery Detection and Localization Resisting to Adversarial Attack</title>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model, without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally, we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark, CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available at https://github.com/Jeoyal/CharacterShot.

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly available at https://github.com/SZAISEC/CLUE.

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6% and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data. From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

<title>Levarging Learning Bias for Noisy Anomaly Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07441</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07441</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies. Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2) feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset. Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data.

Abstract: The increasing number of Health Care facilities in Nepal has also added up the challenges on managing health care waste (HCW). Improper segregation and disposal of HCW leads to the contamination, spreading of infectious diseases and puts a risk of waste handlers. This study benchmarks the state of the art waste classification models: ResNeXt-50, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3-S, YOLOv8-n and YOLOv5-s using Stratified K-fold techniques where we use 5 folds on combined HCW data, and found that the YOLOv5-s achieved higher of 95.06% accuracy but fell short few milliseconds in inference speed with YOLOv8-n model. The EfficientNet-B0 showed promising results of 93.22% accuracy but took the highest inference time. A repetitive ANOVA was performed to see statistical significance and the best performing model (YOLOv5-s) was deployed to the web with mapped bin color using Nepal's HCW management standards for public usage. Further work on the data was suggested along with localized context.

<title>AURA: A Fine-Grained Benchmark and Decomposed Metric for Audio-Visual Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy, overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks), their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for more robust multimodal evaluation.

<title>Novel View Synthesis with Gaussian Splatting: Impact on Photogrammetry Model Accuracy and Resolution</title>

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and autonomous vehicle simulations.

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents. Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables), offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

Abstract: Good form is the difference between strength and strain, yet for the fast-growing community of at-home fitness enthusiasts, expert feedback is often out of reach. FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data (year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year 2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to 0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to 0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species: F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks, revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral patterns.

<title>Enhancing Reliability of Medical Image Diagnosis through Top-rank Learning with Rejection Module</title>

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However, challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image diagnoses.

<title>Enhanced Generative Structure Prior for Chinese Text Image Super-resolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality. Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model, leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally. Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust, character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/csxmli2016/MARCONetPlusPlus

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards, including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B) Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied - such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize these gaps effectively.

<title>CoT-Pose: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for 3D Pose Generation from Abstract Prompts</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract (high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further enhance performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pseudo-labeling method for medical image segmentation that can perform learning on ``individual images'' to select effective pseudo-labels. We introduce Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU learning), which uses only positive and unlabeled data for binary classification problems, to obtain the appropriate metric for discriminating foreground and background regions on each unlabeled image. Our PU learning makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

<title>Decoupled Functional Evaluation of Autonomous Driving Models via Feature Map Quality Scoring</title>

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a 3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 4D content from monocular videos for applications such as digital humans and AR/VR poses challenges in ensuring temporal and spatial consistency, preserving intricate details, and incorporating user guidance effectively. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Splat4D, a novel framework enabling high-fidelity 4D content generation from a monocular video. Splat4D achieves superior performance while maintaining faithful spatial-temporal coherence by leveraging multi-view rendering, inconsistency identification, a video diffusion model, and an asymmetric U-Net for refinement. Through extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, Splat4D consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, underscoring the efficacy of our approach. Additionally, the versatility of Splat4D is validated in various applications such as text/image conditioned 4D generation, 4D human generation, and text-guided content editing, producing coherent outcomes following user instructions.

<title>Adaptive Cache Enhancement for Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models</title>

arXiv:2508.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks, particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios.

<title>Exploiting Layer Normalization Fine-tuning in Visual Transformer Foundation Models for Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts) are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher $\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

<title>GAPNet: A Lightweight Framework for Image and Video Salient Object Detection via Granularity-Aware Paradigm</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07585</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/GAPNet.

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly affect communication and quality of life, requiring an early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods like laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice pathologies using phonation data.
  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents, further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and improving patient outcomes.

<title>From Prediction to Explanation: Multimodal, Explainable, and Interactive Deepfake Detection Framework for Non-Expert Users</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07596</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic, and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new possibilities for practical dialogue video generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LaVieID, a novel \underline{l}ocal \underline{a}utoregressive \underline{vi}d\underline{e}o diffusion framework designed to tackle the challenging \underline{id}entity-preserving text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens, thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently, LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/ssugarwh/LaVieID.

arXiv:2508.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing open-source datasets for arbitrary-instruction image editing remain suboptimal, while a plug-and-play editing module compatible with community-prevalent generative models is notably absent. In this paper, we first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The open-source code, checkpoints, and datasets for X2Edit can be found at the following link: https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/X2Edit.

<title>An Iterative Reconstruction Method for Dental Cone-Beam Computed Tomography with a Truncated Field of View</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07618</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations, leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation (INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading to improved CBCT image quality.

arXiv:2508.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable. Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration, temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization, offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

<title>Enhancing Egocentric Object Detection in Static Environments using Graph-based Spatial Anomaly Detection and Correction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However, state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work, we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%. This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video, achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511 and 0.9035, respectively.

<title>AR-VRM: Imitating Human Motions for Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2508.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme, enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins , underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data scarcity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion, which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly. Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge. Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR). Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data. However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers (ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features. Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different operating conditions with various label noises.

<title>Undress to Redress: A Training-Free Framework for Virtual Try-On</title>

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos. Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority'' completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an ''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment, effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps. Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features, offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$ faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding multi-step diffusion-based variant.

<title>TAR-TVG: Enhancing VLMs with Timestamp Anchor-Constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07683</link>

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions, they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG), a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry. However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run. Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction capability of 3DGS.

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model (LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset construction in complex real-world domains.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By combining the level set representation with the registration framework and imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications, such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

<title>Grouped Speculative Decoding for Autoregressive Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference, leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without requiring any additional training.

<title>Comparison Reveals Commonality: Customized Image Generation through Contrastive Inversion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately, relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

<title>Correspondence as Video: Test-Time Adaption on SAM2 for Reference Segmentation in the Wild</title>

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently, reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules: the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets, achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods. Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems, enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent. However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&amp;G) remain significant challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&amp;G. Besides, SVG generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters, suggesting the potential to address SVG U&amp;G tasks within a unified model. To unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&amp;G tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset, benchmark, weights, codes and experiment details on https://ryanlijinke.github.io/.

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural 4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture: it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes). However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1) unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and various real-world settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet. Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D convolution-based backbone.

<title>Anatomy-Aware Low-Dose CT Denoising via Pretrained Vision Models and Semantic-Guided Contrastive Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem, we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

<title>Boosting Active Defense Persistence: A Two-Stage Defense Framework Combining Interruption and Poisoning Against Deepfake</title>

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence, as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models. This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt, which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF). Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles. First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point, line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density. In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at \href{https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/X-ray-PBD}{PBD5K}.

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images. To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream tasks.

<title>Pose-RFT: Enhancing MLLMs for 3D Pose Generation via Hybrid Action Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences. While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands, preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks, demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

<title>Semi-supervised Multiscale Matching for SAR-Optical Image</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest. Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results, and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

<title>Segmenting and Understanding: Region-aware Semantic Attention for Fine-grained Image Quality Assessment with Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07818</link>

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However, existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations. To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition, RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex, and difficult-to-interpret architectures, which limit transparency and trust. We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings. MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

<title>Effortless Vision-Language Model Specialization in Histopathology without Annotation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness, task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks.

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS, demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand, end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information. Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability.

Abstract: In this paper, electron microscopy images of microstructures formed on Ge surfaces by ion beam irradiation were processed to extract topological features as skeleton graphs, which were then embedded using a graph convolutional network. The resulting embeddings were analyzed using principal component analysis, and cluster separability in the resulting PCA space was evaluated using the Davies-Bouldin index. The results indicate that variations in irradiation angle have a more significant impact on the morphological properties of Ge surfaces than variations in irradiation fluence.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion and a limited field of view. Accurate tissue tracking has the potential to support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive structures, and enable context-aware robotic assistance during complex procedures. In this work, we propose a novel method for markerless 3D tissue tracking by leveraging 2D Tracking Any Point (TAP) networks. Our method combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for accurate, markerless 3D tracking in challenging surgical scenarios.

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck, manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands, limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of motion generation technologies in real-world applications.

<title>CATP: Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning for Efficient and Enhanced Multimodal In-Context Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.07871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical. Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning (CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing 77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\% over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer, and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop (HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images. The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature, with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are available at github.com/hynnsk/SelectiveCL.

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type, resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with only 2.75M parameters.

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios. Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality. Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation. Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\% additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks, such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation, stylization, and face swapping.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images, limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia) and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via https://github.com/andreas-fischer-unifr/nntp.

<title>Generative Video Matting</title>

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a 3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance, and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes, illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/GVM.

<title>Mem4D: Decoupling Static and Dynamic Memory for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM) focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information, ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements. By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

Abstract: Generative AI holds great potentials to automate and enhance data synthesis in nuclear medicine. However, the high-stakes nature of biomedical imaging necessitates robust mechanisms to detect and manage unexpected or erroneous model behavior. We introduce development and implementation of a hybrid anomaly detection framework to safeguard GenAI models in BIOEMTECH's eyes(TM) systems. Two applications are demonstrated: Pose2Xray, which generates synthetic X-rays from photographic mouse images, and DosimetrEYE, which estimates 3D radiation dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD) enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory compliance.

<title>TAG: A Simple Yet Effective Temporal-Aware Approach for Zero-Shot Video Temporal Grounding</title>

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment. Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding, which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nuetee/TAG

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories. However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues. First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and privacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance.

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in automated surgical scene understanding, with the long-term goal of improving patient outcomes. Developing personalized intelligence for all staff members requires maintaining a consistent state of who is located where for long surgical procedures, which still poses numerous computational challenges. We propose TrackOR, a framework for tackling long-term multi-person tracking and re-identification in the operating room. TrackOR uses 3D geometric signatures to achieve state-of-the-art online tracking performance (+11% Association Accuracy over the strongest baseline), while also enabling an effective offline recovery process to create analysis-ready trajectories. Our work shows that by leveraging 3D geometric information, persistent identity tracking becomes attainable, enabling a critical shift towards the more granular, staff-centric analyses required for personalized intelligent systems in the operating room. This new capability opens up various applications, including our proposed temporal pathway imprints that translate raw tracking data into actionable insights for improving team efficiency and safety and ultimately providing personalized support.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges, we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts (LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference. (2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of desired effects.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness. This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and (III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety, reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

arXiv:2508.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2, offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings, our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only 10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group reasoning. Code and models will be released.

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric, search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data, enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample. Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs applicable to a variety of future tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers. Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of modeling humans in the OR.

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a 12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE.

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework. This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning. Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere, WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at: https://daipengwa.github.io/S-2VG_ProjectPage/

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts. To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality, accelerated MRI reconstruction. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/multimodallearning/PrIINeR.

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors, and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in mAP for Endo.

<title>ME-TST+: Micro-expression Analysis via Temporal State Transition with ROI Relationship Awareness</title>

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels, leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at https://github.com/zizheng-guo/ME-TST.

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation. See more in https://matrix-3d.github.io.

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules: an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system.

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture, incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system. Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

<title>TBAC-UniImage: Unified Understanding and Generation by Ladder-Side Diffusion Tuning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08098</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm. Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple, diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model. This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently, TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of understanding and generation.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an advanced sensing modality that simultaneously captures spatial and spectral information, enabling non-invasive, label-free analysis of material, chemical, and biological properties. This Primer presents a comprehensive overview of HSI, from the underlying physical principles and sensor architectures to key steps in data acquisition, calibration, and correction. We summarize common data structures and highlight classical and modern analysis methods, including dimensionality reduction, classification, spectral unmixing, and AI-driven techniques such as deep learning. Representative applications across Earth observation, precision agriculture, biomedicine, industrial inspection, cultural heritage, and security are also discussed, emphasizing HSI's ability to uncover sub-visual features for advanced monitoring, diagnostics, and decision-making. Persistent challenges, such as hardware trade-offs, acquisition variability, and the complexity of high-dimensional data, are examined alongside emerging solutions, including computational imaging, physics-informed modeling, cross-modal fusion, and self-supervised learning. Best practices for dataset sharing, reproducibility, and metadata documentation are further highlighted to support transparency and reuse. Looking ahead, we explore future directions toward scalable, real-time, and embedded HSI systems, driven by sensor miniaturization, self-supervised learning, and foundation models. As HSI evolves into a general-purpose, cross-disciplinary platform, it holds promise for transformative applications in science, technology, and society.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation. Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence parameters to improve the accuracy and generalizability of quantitative image synthesis from clinical weighted MRI. Our physics-driven neural network embeds MRI sequence parameters -- repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and inversion time (TI) -- directly into the model via parameter embedding, enabling the network to learn the underlying physical principles of MRI signal formation. The model takes conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images as input and synthesizes T1, T2, and proton density (PD) quantitative maps. Trained on healthy brain MR images, it was evaluated on both internal and external test datasets. The proposed method achieved high performance with PSNR values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions. Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability. Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals, significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and improving its clinical utility.

<title>Follow-Your-Shape: Shape-Aware Image Editing via Trajectory-Guided Region Control</title>

arXiv:2508.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.

<title>FantasyStyle: Controllable Stylized Distillation for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual realism across various scenes and styles.

Abstract: The field of visual and audio generation is burgeoning with new state-of-the-art methods. This rapid proliferation of new techniques underscores the need for robust solutions for detecting synthetic content in videos. In particular, when fine-grained alterations via localized manipulations are performed in visual, audio, or both domains, these subtle modifications add challenges to the detection algorithms. This paper presents solutions for the problems of deepfake video classification and localization. The methods were submitted to the ACM 1M Deepfakes Detection Challenge, achieving the best performance in the temporal localization task and a top four ranking in the classification task for the TestA split of the evaluation dataset.

<title>Integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters for Pre-Trained Model-based Class-Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter. Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation, these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA), which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in). Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details. Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific simulations. The code is available at https://github.com/Xin-Gao-private/CD-TVD.

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images; RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem, requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small, and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial, single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'', matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm, highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film, sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion, a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of motion fidelity than previous work.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders. Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification. Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and generalization ability.

<title>THAT: Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer for Hyperspectral Pansharpening</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g., abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective, Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens. These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer (THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection. Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA (Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction). Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection systems without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training, preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future inquiry.

<title>Spatial-ORMLLM: Improve Spatial Relation Understanding in the Operating Room with Multimodal Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and robotic applications.

Abstract: User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes'' and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating images that align with individual tastes.

<title>OMGSR: You Only Need One Mid-timestep Guidance for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>

arXiv:2508.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM) generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep, incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants: OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a 1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation (NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity. Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically coherent subsequent shots.

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio, StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this, StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/heshuting555/ReferSplat.

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles, resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations, showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Codebook-based generative semantic communication attracts increasing attention, since only indices are required to be transmitted when the codebook is shared between transmitter and receiver. However, due to the fact that the semantic relations among code vectors are not necessarily related to the distance of the corresponding code indices, the performance of the codebook-enabled semantic communication system is susceptible to the channel noise. Thus, how to improve the system robustness against the noise requires careful design. This paper proposes a robust codebook-assisted image semantic communication system, where semantic codec and codebook are first jointly constructed, and then vector-to-index transformer is designed guided by the codebook to eliminate the effects of channel noise, and achieve image generation. Thanks to the assistance of the high-quality codebook to the Transformer, the generated images at the receiver outperform those of the compared methods in terms of visual perception. In the end, numerical results and generated images demonstrate the advantages of the generative semantic communication method over JPEG+LDPC and traditional joint source channel coding (JSCC) methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated potential in autonomous driving. However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1) Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset, leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency. Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance to foster further research.

Abstract: A major limitation of two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in imaging porous membranes is its inability to resolve three-dimensional pore architecture and interconnectivity, which are critical factors governing membrane performance. Although conventional tomographic 3-D reconstruction techniques can address this limitation, they are often expensive, technically challenging, and not widely accessible. We previously introduced a proof-of-concept method for reconstructing a membrane's 3-D pore network from a single 2-D SEM image, yielding statistically equivalent results to those obtained from 3-D tomography. However, this initial approach struggled to replicate the diverse pore geometries commonly observed in real membranes. In this study, we advance the methodology by developing an enhanced reconstruction algorithm that not only maintains essential statistical properties (e.g., pore size distribution), but also accurately reproduces intricate pore morphologies. Applying this technique to a commercial microfiltration membrane, we generated a high-fidelity 3-D reconstruction and derived key membrane properties. Validation with X-ray tomography data revealed excellent agreement in structural metrics, with our SEM-based approach achieving superior resolution in resolving fine pore features. The tool can be readily applied to isotropic porous membrane structures of any pore size, as long as those pores can be visualized by SEM. Further work is needed for 3-D structure generation of anisotropic membranes.

Abstract: Timely and accurate severe weather warnings are critical for disaster mitigation. However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on manual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant operational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the end-to-end "AI weather station" is gradually emerging as a new trend in predicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development of end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data and textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to handle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the complex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and spatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the first large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios across China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench demonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a key step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Precise needle alignment is essential for percutaneous needle insertion in robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. However, inherent challenges such as speckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust needle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In this paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound imaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many existing approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound images, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the needle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based energy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of plane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the ultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the needle insertion plane in both translation and rotation. Experiments conducted on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic ultrasound-guided needle insertion system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show the translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and the rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

<title>Membership Inference Attacks with False Discovery Rate Control</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record was used to train a target model or not. To analyze and study these vulnerabilities, various MIA methods have been proposed. Despite the significance and popularity of MIAs, existing works on MIAs are limited in providing guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR), which refers to the expected proportion of false discoveries among the identified positive discoveries. However, it is very challenging to ensure the false discovery rate guarantees, because the underlying distribution is usually unknown, and the estimated non-member probabilities often exhibit interdependence. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we design a novel membership inference attack method, which can provide the guarantees on the false discovery rate. Additionally, we show that our method can also provide the marginal probability guarantee on labeling true non-member data as member data. Notably, our method can work as a wrapper that can be seamlessly integrated with existing MIA methods in a post-hoc manner, while also providing the FDR control. We perform the theoretical analysis for our method. Extensive experiments in various settings (e.g., the black-box setting and the lifelong learning setting) are also conducted to verify the desirable performance of our method.

<title>Towards High-Order Mean Flow Generative Models: Feasibility, Expressivity, and Provably Efficient Criteria</title>

Abstract: Generative modelling has seen significant advances through simulation-free paradigms such as Flow Matching, and in particular, the MeanFlow framework, which replaces instantaneous velocity fields with average velocities to enable efficient single-step sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretical study on Second-Order MeanFlow, a novel extension that incorporates average acceleration fields into the MeanFlow objective. We first establish the feasibility of our approach by proving that the average acceleration satisfies a generalized consistency condition analogous to first-order MeanFlow, thereby supporting stable, one-step sampling and tractable loss functions. We then characterize its expressivity via circuit complexity analysis, showing that under mild assumptions, the Second-Order MeanFlow sampling process can be implemented by uniform threshold circuits within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class. Finally, we derive provably efficient criteria for scalable implementation by leveraging fast approximate attention computations: we prove that attention operations within the Second-Order MeanFlow architecture can be approximated to within $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. Together, these results lay the theoretical foundation for high-order flow matching models that combine rich dynamics with practical sampling efficiency.

<title>Sensory robustness through top-down feedback and neural stochasticity in recurrent vision models</title>

Abstract: Biological systems leverage top-down feedback for visual processing, yet most artificial vision models succeed in image classification using purely feedforward or recurrent architectures, calling into question the functional significance of descending cortical pathways. Here, we trained convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNN) on image classification in the presence or absence of top-down feedback projections to elucidate the specific computational contributions of those feedback pathways. We found that ConvRNNs with top-down feedback exhibited remarkable speed-accuracy trade-off and robustness to noise perturbations and adversarial attacks, but only when they were trained with stochastic neural variability, simulated by randomly silencing single units via dropout. By performing detailed analyses to identify the reasons for such benefits, we observed that feedback information substantially shaped the representational geometry of the post-integration layer, combining the bottom-up and top-down streams, and this effect was amplified by dropout. Moreover, feedback signals coupled with dropout optimally constrained network activity onto a low-dimensional manifold and encoded object information more efficiently in out-of-distribution regimes, with top-down information stabilizing the representational dynamics at the population level. Together, these findings uncover a dual mechanism for resilient sensory coding. On the one hand, neural stochasticity prevents unit-level co-adaptation albeit at the cost of more chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, top-down feedback harnesses high-level information to stabilize network activity on compact low-dimensional manifolds.

<title>Fading the Digital Ink: A Universal Black-Box Attack Framework for 3DGS Watermarking Systems</title>

Abstract: With the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a variety of digital watermarking techniques, embedding either 1D bitstreams or 2D images, are used for copyright protection. However, the robustness of these watermarking techniques against potential attacks remains underexplored. This paper introduces the first universal black-box attack framework, the Group-based Multi-objective Evolutionary Attack (GMEA), designed to challenge these watermarking systems. We formulate the attack as a large-scale multi-objective optimization problem, balancing watermark removal with visual quality. In a black-box setting, we introduce an indirect objective function that blinds the watermark detector by minimizing the standard deviation of features extracted by a convolutional network, thus rendering the feature maps uninformative. To manage the vast search space of 3DGS models, we employ a group-based optimization strategy to partition the model into multiple, independent sub-optimization problems. Experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively removes both 1D and 2D watermarks from mainstream 3DGS watermarking methods while maintaining high visual fidelity. This work reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing 3DGS copyright protection schemes and calls for the development of more robust watermarking systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of audio-driven talking head generators and advanced Text-To-Speech (TTS) models has led to more sophisticated temporal deepfakes. These advances highlight the need for robust methods capable of detecting and localizing deepfakes, even under novel, unseen attack scenarios. Current state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, while accurate, are often computationally expensive and struggle to generalize to novel manipulation techniques. To address these challenges, we propose multimodal approaches for the AV-Deepfake1M 2025 challenge. For the visual modality, we leverage handcrafted features to improve interpretability and adaptability. For the audio modality, we adapt a self-supervised learning (SSL) backbone coupled with graph attention networks to capture rich audio representations, improving detection robustness. Our approach strikes a balance between performance and real-world deployment, focusing on resilience and potential interpretability. On the AV-Deepfake1M++ dataset, our multimodal system achieves AUC of 92.78% for deepfake classification task and IoU of 0.3536 for temporal localization using only the audio modality.

Abstract: Agricultural robots have emerged as powerful members in agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or untransportable railway for movement, resulting in limited mobility and poor adaptability. Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) enables robots to navigate to the target destinations following natural language instructions, demonstrating strong performance on several domains. However, none of the existing benchmarks or methods is specifically designed for agricultural scenes. To bridge this gap, we propose Agriculture to Agriculture (A2A) benchmark, containing 1,560 episodes across six diverse agricultural scenes, in which all realistic RGB videos are captured by front-facing camera on a quadruped robot at a height of 0.38 meters, aligning with the practical deployment conditions. Meanwhile, we propose Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots (AgriVLN) baseline based on Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompted with carefully crafted templates, which can understand both given instructions and agricultural environments to generate appropriate low-level actions for robot control. When evaluated on A2A, AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles with long instructions, because it often fails to track which part of the instruction is currently being executed. To address this, we further propose Subtask List (STL) instruction decomposition module and integrate it into AgriVLN, improving Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47. We additionally compare AgriVLN with several existing VLN methods, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

<title>Extracting Overlapping Microservices from Monolithic Code via Deep Semantic Embeddings and Graph Neural Network-Based Soft Clustering</title>

arXiv:2508.07486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern software systems are increasingly shifting from monolithic architectures to microservices to enhance scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility. Existing microservice extraction methods typically rely on hard clustering, assigning each software component to a single microservice. This approach often increases inter-service coupling and reduces intra-service cohesion. We propose Mo2oM (Monolithic to Overlapping Microservices), a framework that formulates microservice extraction as a soft clustering problem, allowing components to belong probabilistically to multiple microservices. This approach is inspired by expert-driven decompositions, where practitioners intentionally replicate certain software components across services to reduce communication overhead. Mo2oM combines deep semantic embeddings with structural dependencies extracted from methodcall graphs to capture both functional and architectural relationships. A graph neural network-based soft clustering algorithm then generates the final set of microservices. We evaluate Mo2oM on four open-source monolithic benchmarks and compare it against eight state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that Mo2oM achieves improvements of up to 40.97% in structural modularity (balancing cohesion and coupling), 58% in inter-service call percentage (communication overhead), 26.16% in interface number (modularity and decoupling), and 38.96% in non-extreme distribution (service size balance) across all benchmarks.

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception has become a foundational paradigm in autonomous driving, enabling unified spatial representations that support robust multi-sensor fusion and multi-agent collaboration. As autonomous vehicles transition from controlled environments to real-world deployment, ensuring the safety and reliability of BEV perception in complex scenarios - such as occlusions, adverse weather, and dynamic traffic - remains a critical challenge. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of BEV perception from a safety-critical perspective, systematically analyzing state-of-the-art frameworks and implementation strategies across three progressive stages: single-modality vehicle-side, multimodal vehicle-side, and multi-agent collaborative perception. Furthermore, we examine public datasets encompassing vehicle-side, roadside, and collaborative settings, evaluating their relevance to safety and robustness. We also identify key open-world challenges - including open-set recognition, large-scale unlabeled data, sensor degradation, and inter-agent communication latency - and outline future research directions, such as integration with end-to-end autonomous driving systems, embodied intelligence, and large language models.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the perceptual quality of face images is crucial, especially with the rapid progress in face restoration and generation. Traditional quality assessment methods often struggle with the unique characteristics of face images, limiting their generalizability. While learning-based approaches demonstrate superior performance due to their strong fitting capabilities, their high complexity typically incurs significant computational and storage costs, hindering practical deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight face quality assessment network with Multi-Stage Progressive Training (MSPT). Our network employs a three-stage progressive training strategy that gradually introduces more diverse data samples and increases input image resolution. This novel approach enables lightweight networks to achieve high performance by effectively learning complex quality features while significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our MSPT achieved the second highest score on the VQualA 2025 face image quality assessment benchmark dataset, demonstrating that MSPT achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining efficient inference.

Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) combines audio-visual modalities to improve speech recognition, especially in noisy environments. However, most existing methods deploy the unidirectional enhancement or symmetric fusion manner, which limits their capability to capture heterogeneous and complementary correlations of audio-visual data-especially under asymmetric information conditions. To tackle these gaps, we introduce a new AVSR framework termed AD-AVSR based on bidirectional modality enhancement. Specifically, we first introduce the audio dual-stream encoding strategy to enrich audio representations from multiple perspectives and intentionally establish asymmetry to support subsequent cross-modal interactions. The enhancement process involves two key components, Audio-aware Visual Refinement Module for enhanced visual representations under audio guidance, and Cross-modal Noise Suppression Masking Module which refines audio representations using visual cues, collaboratively leading to the closed-loop and bidirectional information flow. To further enhance correlation robustness, we adopt a threshold-based selection mechanism to filter out irrelevant or weakly correlated audio-visual pairs. Extensive experimental results on the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets indicate that our AD-AVSR consistently surpasses SOTA methods in both performance and noise robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of our model design.

Abstract: We introduce InterChart, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates how well vision-language models (VLMs) reason across multiple related charts, a task central to real-world applications such as scientific reporting, financial analysis, and public policy dashboards. Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on isolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse question types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical estimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or structurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of increasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2) integrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic inference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep accuracy declines as chart complexity increases. We find that models perform better when we decompose multi-entity charts into simpler visual units, underscoring their struggles with cross-chart integration. By exposing these systematic limitations, InterChart provides a rigorous framework for advancing multimodal reasoning in complex, multi-visual environments.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents. Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills (e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

Abstract: Accurate image-based bathymetric mapping in shallow waters remains challenging due to the complex optical distortions such as wave induced patterns, scattering and sunglint, introduced by the dynamic water surface, the water column properties, and solar illumination. In this work, we introduce Sea-Undistort, a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 1200 paired 512x512 through-water scenes rendered in Blender. Each pair comprises a distortion-free and a distorted view, featuring realistic water effects such as sun glint, waves, and scattering over diverse seabeds. Accompanied by per-image metadata such as camera parameters, sun position, and average depth, Sea-Undistort enables supervised training that is otherwise infeasible in real environments. We use Sea-Undistort to benchmark two state-of-the-art image restoration methods alongside an enhanced lightweight diffusion-based framework with an early-fusion sun-glint mask. When applied to real aerial data, the enhanced diffusion model delivers more complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed, especially in deeper areas, reduces bathymetric errors, suppresses glint and scattering, and crisply restores fine seabed details. Dataset, weights, and code are publicly available at https://www.magicbathy.eu/Sea-Undistort.html.

Abstract: Active Infrared thermography (AIRT) is a widely adopted non-destructive testing (NDT) technique for detecting subsurface anomalies in industrial components. Due to the high dimensionality of AIRT data, current approaches employ non-linear autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. However, the latent space learned by AIRT AEs lacks structure, limiting their effectiveness in downstream defect characterization tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a principal component analysis guided (PCA-guided) autoencoding framework for structured dimensionality reduction to capture intricate, non-linear features in thermographic signals while enforcing a structured latent space. A novel loss function, PCA distillation loss, is introduced to guide AIRT AEs to align the latent representation with structured PCA components while capturing the intricate, non-linear patterns in thermographic signals. To evaluate the utility of the learned, structured latent space, we propose a neural network-based evaluation metric that assesses its suitability for defect characterization. Experimental results show that the proposed PCA-guided AE outperforms state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods on PVC, CFRP, and PLA samples in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and neural network-based metrics.

Abstract: The core role of medical images in disease diagnosis makes their quality directly affect the accuracy of clinical judgment. However, due to factors such as low-dose scanning, equipment limitations and imaging artifacts, medical images are often accompanied by non-uniform noise interference, which seriously affects structure recognition and lesion detection. This paper proposes a medical image adaptive denoising model (MI-ND) that integrates multi-scale convolutional and Transformer architecture, introduces a noise level estimator (NLE) and a noise adaptive attention module (NAAB), and realizes channel-spatial attention regulation and cross-modal feature fusion driven by noise perception. Systematic testing is carried out on multimodal public datasets. Experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the comparative methods in image quality indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, and improves the F1 score and ROC-AUC in downstream diagnostic tasks, showing strong prac-tical value and promotional potential. The model has outstanding benefits in structural recovery, diagnostic sensitivity, and cross-modal robustness, and provides an effective solution for medical image enhancement and AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced AI-driven perception system for autonomous quadcopter navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments. The proposed framework leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42 trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1 second. This cloud-supported, high-intelligence framework serves as an auxiliary perception and navigation system, complementing state-of-the-art drone autonomy for GPS-denied confined spaces.

Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning, hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts, with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor. By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical capacity constraints in forensic systems.

Abstract: Federated self-supervised learning (FSSL) combines the advantages of decentralized modeling and unlabeled representation learning, serving as a cutting-edge paradigm with strong potential for scalability and privacy preservation. Although FSSL has garnered increasing attention, research indicates that it remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing methods generally rely on visually obvious triggers, which makes it difficult to meet the requirements for stealth and practicality in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack method against FSSL, called IPBA. Our empirical study reveals that existing imperceptible triggers face a series of challenges in FSSL, particularly limited transferability, feature entanglement with augmented samples, and out-of-distribution properties. These issues collectively undermine the effectiveness and stealthiness of traditional backdoor attacks in FSSL. To overcome these challenges, IPBA decouples the feature distributions of backdoor and augmented samples, and introduces Sliced-Wasserstein distance to mitigate the out-of-distribution properties of backdoor samples, thereby optimizing the trigger generation process. Our experimental results on several FSSL scenarios and datasets show that IPBA significantly outperforms existing backdoor attack methods in performance and exhibits strong robustness under various defense mechanisms.

This inverse problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed, posing significant challenges for conventional optimization-based methods, which, despite being grounded in physical models, often fail to recover fine structural details. Recent deep learning strategies, including end-to-end and post-processing networks, have improved reconstruction quality but typically require large paired training datasets and may struggle to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we propose a physics-informed hybrid framework that integrates diffusion models as learned regularization within a data-consistency-driven variational scheme. Specifically, we introduce Single-Step Diffusion Regularization (SSD-Reg), a novel approach that embeds diffusion priors into the iterative reconstruction process, enabling the recovery of complex anatomical structures without the need for paired data. SSD-Reg maintains fidelity to both the governing physics and learned structural distributions, improving accuracy, stability, and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSD-Reg, implemented as a Plug-and-Play (PnP) module, provides a flexible and effective solution for tackling the ill-posedness inherent in functional image reconstruction.

Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments. This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions. Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon mobile manipulation has long been a grand challenge in embodied semantic reasoning, generalizable manipulation, and adaptive locomotion. Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First, although large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task planning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to tabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited actuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies exhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object configurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for practical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform maneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings remains understudied.
  In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for agile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates high-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the challenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce a hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling long-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the control level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across challenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon mobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through successful sim-to-real transfer, we demonstrate the system's generalization and robustness in real-world deployments, underscoring the practicality of legged manipulators in unstructured environments. Our work advances the feasibility of generalized robotic assistants capable of complex, dynamic tasks. Our project page: https://kaijwang.github.io/odyssey.github.io/

Abstract: Although deep neural networks can achieve human-level performance on many object recognition benchmarks, prior work suggests that these same models fail to learn simple abstract relations, such as determining whether two objects are the same or different. Much of this prior work focuses on training convolutional neural networks to classify images of two same or two different abstract shapes, testing generalization on within-distribution stimuli. In this article, we comprehensively study whether deep neural networks can acquire and generalize same-different relations both within and out-of-distribution using a variety of architectures, forms of pretraining, and fine-tuning datasets. We find that certain pretrained transformers can learn a same-different relation that generalizes with near perfect accuracy to out-of-distribution stimuli. Furthermore, we find that fine-tuning on abstract shapes that lack texture or color provides the strongest out-of-distribution generalization. Our results suggest that, with the right approach, deep neural networks can learn generalizable same-different visual relations.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) enables a smaller "student" model to mimic a larger "teacher" model by transferring knowledge from the teacher's output or features. However, most KD methods treat all samples uniformly, overlooking the varying learning value of each sample and thereby limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Entropy-based Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (EA-KD), a simple yet effective plug-and-play KD method that prioritizes learning from valuable samples. EA-KD quantifies each sample's learning value by strategically combining the entropy of the teacher and student output, then dynamically reweights the distillation loss to place greater emphasis on high-entropy samples. Extensive experiments across diverse KD frameworks and tasks -- including image classification, object detection, and large language model (LLM) distillation -- demonstrate that EA-KD consistently enhances performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with negligible computational cost.

Abstract: Humans are remarkably efficient at forming spatial understanding from just a few visual observations. When browsing real estate or navigating unfamiliar spaces, they intuitively select a small set of views that summarize the spatial layout. Inspired by this ability, we introduce scene summarization, the task of condensing long, continuous scene videos into a compact set of spatially diverse keyframes that facilitate global spatial reasoning. Unlike conventional video summarization-which focuses on user-edited, fragmented clips and often ignores spatial continuity-our goal is to mimic how humans abstract spatial layout from sparse views. We propose SceneSum, a two-stage self-supervised pipeline that first clusters video frames using visual place recognition to promote spatial diversity, then selects representative keyframes from each cluster under resource constraints. When camera trajectories are available, a lightweight supervised loss further refines clustering and selection. Experiments on real and simulated indoor datasets show that SceneSum produces more spatially informative summaries and outperforms existing video summarization baselines.

Abstract: Agricultural production is facing severe challenges in the next decades induced by climate change and the need for sustainability, reducing its impact on the environment. Advancements in field management through non-chemical weeding by robots in combination with monitoring of crops by autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and breeding of novel and more resilient crop varieties are helpful to address these challenges. The analysis of plant traits, called phenotyping, is an essential activity in plant breeding, it however involves a great amount of manual labor. With this paper, we address the problem of automatic fine-grained organ-level geometric analysis needed for precision phenotyping. As the availability of real-world data in this domain is relatively scarce, we propose a novel dataset that was acquired using UAVs capturing high-resolution images of a real breeding trial containing 48 plant varieties and therefore covering great morphological and appearance diversity. This enables the development of approaches for autonomous phenotyping that generalize well to different varieties. Based on overlapping high-resolution images from multiple viewing angles, we compute photogrammetric dense point clouds and provide detailed and accurate point-wise labels for plants, leaves, and salient points as the tip and the base. Additionally, we include measurements of phenotypic traits performed by experts from the German Federal Plant Variety Office on the real plants, allowing the evaluation of new approaches not only on segmentation and keypoint detection but also directly on the downstream tasks. The provided labeled point clouds enable fine-grained plant analysis and support further progress in the development of automatic phenotyping approaches, but also enable further research in surface reconstruction, point cloud completion, and semantic interpretation of point clouds.

<title>Towards Customized Knowledge Distillation for Chip-Level Dense Image Predictions</title>

Abstract: It has been revealed that efficient dense image prediction (EDIP) models designed for AI chips, trained using the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, encounter two key challenges, including \emph{maintaining boundary region completeness} and \emph{ensuring target region connectivity}, despite their favorable real-time capacity to recognize the main object regions. In this work, we propose a customized boundary and context knowledge distillation (BCKD) method for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted KD from large accurate teacher models to compact small student models. Specifically, the \emph{boundary distillation} focuses on extracting explicit object-level boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Meanwhile, the \emph{context distillation} leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed method is specifically designed for the EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on five representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BCKD, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) classification is a challenging task because 1) patches from WSI lack annotation, and 2) WSI possesses unnecessary variability, e.g., stain protocol. Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms. We release our code at https://github.com/AITRICS/pathology_mil.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for video understanding are primarily fine-tuned with various videos scraped from online platforms. Existing datasets, such as ActivityNet, require considerable human labor for structuring and annotation before effectively utilized for tuning LVLMs. While current LVLMs are primarily trained on existing datasets in broad, general-purpose settings, adapting them to specific downstream scenarios remains challenging, as collecting and annotating task-specific videos is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage framework named DreamFrame for automatically generating style-consistent keyframes and corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs to support LVLM instruction tuning. DreamFrame generates datasets in a movie-like manner. First, we utilize an LLM to generate structured movie plots including movie prior information (like overview and style), frame descriptions and plot-related QA pairs, with a story expansion strategy to mitigate context length limitations.Then, to ensure visual consistency across generated frames, we design a Style Immobilization Process which maintains consistent style through an embedding learning strategy. Finally, frame descriptions and style embeddings are integrated to produce coherent keyframes. Using DreamFrame, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 1k stylized keyframe-like videos and 100k diverse QA pairs. Extensive fine-tuned experiments on various LVLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Furthermore, based on the proposed dataset, we fine-tune a new LVLM named DreamFrame-7B, which significantly surpasses the previous similar-sized LVLMs across different benchmarks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection has gained significant attention recently due to its irreplaceable all-weather imaging capabilities. However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising <2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models. This work aims to pave the way for further advancements in SAR object detection. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/zcablii/SARDet_100K.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have achieved fine-grained object perception, but the limitation of image resolution remains a significant obstacle to surpassing the performance of task-specific experts in complex and dense scenarios. Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, counting, \textit{etc}. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scale up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details and significantly improves multimodal perception ability, especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts, and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC and phrase grounding, and outperform expert models in object detection, object counting, and REG. Data and codes are released at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/Griffon.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that aims to generate spoken language sentences from sign language videos. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight, modular SLT framework, Spotter+GPT, that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and avoids heavy end-to-end training. Spotter+GPT breaks down the SLT task into two distinct stages. First, a sign spotter identifies individual signs within the input video. The spotted signs are then passed to an LLM, which transforms them into meaningful spoken language sentences. Spotter+GPT eliminates the requirement for SLT-specific training. This significantly reduces computational costs and time requirements. The source code and pretrained weights of the Spotter are available at https://gitlab.surrey.ac.uk/cogvispublic/sign-spotter.

Abstract: While much research has recently focused on generating physics-based adversarial samples, a critical yet often overlooked category originates from physical failures within on-board cameras -- components essential to the perception systems of autonomous vehicles. Firstly, we motivate the study using two separate real-world experiments to showcase that indeed glass failures would cause the detection based neural network models to fail. Secondly, we develop a simulation-based study using the physical process of the glass breakage to create perturbed scenarios, representing a realistic class of physics-based adversarial samples. Using a finite element model (FEM)-based approach, we generate surface cracks on the camera image by applying a stress field defined by particles within a triangular mesh. Lastly, we use physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to provide realistic visualizations of these physically plausible fractures. To analyze the safety implications, we superimpose these simulated broken glass effects as image filters on widely used open-source datasets: KITTI and BDD100K using two most prominent object detection neural networks (CNN-based -- YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN) and Pyramid Vision Transformers. To further investigate the distributional impact of these visual distortions, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between three distinct data distributions, applying various broken glass filters to a custom dataset (captured through a cracked windshield), as well as the KITTI and Kaggle cats and dogs datasets. The K-L divergence analysis suggests that these broken glass filters do not introduce significant distributional shifts.

Abstract: Reported face verification accuracy has reached a plateau on current well-known test sets. As a result, some difficult test sets have been assembled by reducing the image quality or adding artifacts to the image. However, we argue that test sets can be challenging without artificially reducing the image quality because the face recognition (FR) models suffer from correctly recognizing 1) the pairs from the same identity (i.e., genuine pairs) with a large face attribute difference, 2) the pairs from different identities (i.e., impostor pairs) with a small face attribute difference, and 3) the pairs of similar-looking identities (e.g., twins and relatives). We propose three challenging test sets to reveal important but ignored weaknesses of the existing FR algorithms. To challenge models on variation of facial attributes, we propose Hadrian and Eclipse to address facial hair differences and face exposure differences. The images in both test sets are high-quality and collected in a controlled environment. To challenge FR models on similar-looking persons, we propose twins-IND, which contains images from a dedicated twins dataset. The LFW test protocol is used to structure the proposed test sets. Moreover, we introduce additional rules to assemble "Goldilocks1" level test sets, including 1) restricted number of occurrence of hard samples, 2) equal chance evaluation across demographic groups, and 3) constrained identity overlap across validation folds. Quantitatively, without further processing the images, the proposed test sets have on-par or higher difficulties than the existing test sets.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models has markedly enhanced the understanding of short videos (typically under one minute), and several evaluation datasets have emerged accordingly. However, these advancements fall short of meeting the demands of real-world applications such as embodied intelligence for long-term decision-making, in-depth movie reviews and discussions, and live sports commentary, all of which require comprehension of long videos spanning several hours. To address this gap, we introduce LVBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video understanding. Our dataset comprises publicly sourced videos and encompasses a diverse set of tasks aimed at long video comprehension and information extraction. LVBench is designed to challenge multimodal models to demonstrate long-term memory and extended comprehension capabilities. Our extensive evaluations reveal that current multimodal models still underperform on these demanding long video understanding tasks. Through LVBench, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of tackling the complexities of long video comprehension. Our data and code are publicly available at: https://lvbench.github.io.

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos, such as movies and TV episodes ranging from tens of minutes to two hours, remains a significant challenge for multi-modal models. Existing benchmarks often fail to test the full range of cognitive skills needed to process these temporally rich and narratively complex inputs. Therefore, we introduce InfiniBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of models in long video understanding rigorously. InfiniBench offers:(1) Over 1,000 hours of video content, with an average video length of 53 minutes. (2) The largest set of question-answer pairs for long video comprehension, totaling around 91 K. (3) Eight diverse skills that span both grounding-based (e.g., scene transitions, character actions) and reasoning-based (e.g., deep context understanding, multi-event linking). (4) Rich annotation formats, including both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. We conducted an in-depth evaluation across both commercial (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) and most recent open-source vision-language models such as Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3.0). Results reveal that:(1) Models struggle across the board: Even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 47.1 % on grounding-based skills, with most models performing near or just above random chance. (2) Strong reliance on world knowledge: Models achieve surprisingly high scores using only metadata (e.g., video titles), highlighting a tendency to rely on pre-trained knowledge rather than actual visual or temporal understanding. (3) Multi-Modal Importance: When provided with full video and subtitle context, however, models show substantial improvements, confirming the critical role of multimodal input in video understanding.

Abstract: This study explores the recently proposed and challenging multi-view Anomaly Detection (AD) task. Single-view tasks will encounter blind spots from other perspectives, resulting in inaccuracies in sample-level prediction. Therefore, we introduce the Multi-View Anomaly Detection (MVAD) approach, which learns and integrates features from multi-views. Specifically, we propose a Multi-View Adaptive Selection (MVAS) algorithm for feature learning and fusion across multiple views. The feature maps are divided into neighbourhood attention windows to calculate a semantic correlation matrix between single-view windows and all other views, which is an attention mechanism conducted for each single-view window and the top-k most correlated multi-view windows. Adjusting the window sizes and top-k can minimise the complexity to O((hw)^4/3). Extensive experiments on the Real-IAD dataset under the multi-class setting validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of +2.5 across 10 metrics at the sample/image/pixel levels, using only 18M parameters and requiring fewer FLOPs and training time. The codes are available at https://github.com/lewandofskee/MVAD.

However, training these models requires large-scale datasets, which brings challenges related to efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of web data. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a new data synthesis and curation method for generating image-caption pairs. Unlike traditional methods, where captions are generated from images, SynthVLM utilizes advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to synthesize and select images from text captions, thereby creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. We further introduce SynthVLM-100K, a high-quality dataset consisting of 100K curated and synthesized image-caption pairs. In both model and human evaluations, SynthVLM-100K outperforms traditional real-world datasets. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B, which achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various vision question-answering (VQA) tasks. Notably, our models outperform LLaVA across most metrics with only 18\% pretrain data. Furthermore, SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B attain SOTA performance on the MMLU benchmark, demonstrating that the high-quality SynthVLM-100K dataset preserves language abilities.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Multimodal LLMs, evaluating their mathematical reasoning capabilities has become an increasingly important research direction. In particular, visual-textual mathematical reasoning serves as a key indicator of an MLLM's ability to comprehend and solve complex, multi-step quantitative problems. While existing benchmarks such as MathVista and MathVerse have advanced the evaluation of multimodal math proficiency, they primarily rely on digitally rendered content and fall short in capturing the complexity of real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MathScape, a novel benchmark focused on assessing MLLMs' reasoning ability in realistic mathematical contexts. MathScape comprises 1,369 high-quality math problems paired with human-captured real-world images, closely reflecting the challenges encountered in practical educational settings. We conduct a thorough multi-dimensional evaluation across nine leading closed-source MLLMs, three open-source MLLMs with over 20 billion parameters, and seven smaller-scale MLLMs. Our results show that even SOTA models struggle with real-world math tasks, lagging behind human performance -- highlighting critical limitations in current model capabilities. Moreover, we find that strong performance on synthetic or digitally rendered images does not guarantee similar effectiveness on real-world tasks. This underscores the necessity of MathScape in the next stage of multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Synthesizing motion-rich and temporally consistent videos remains a challenge in artificial intelligence, especially when dealing with extended durations. Existing text-to-video (T2V) models commonly employ spatial cross-attention for text control, equivalently guiding different frame generations without frame-specific textual guidance. Thus, the model's capacity to comprehend the temporal logic conveyed in prompts and generate videos with coherent motion is restricted. To tackle this limitation, we introduce FancyVideo, an innovative video generator that improves the existing text-control mechanism with the well-designed Cross-frame Textual Guidance Module (CTGM). Specifically, CTGM incorporates the Temporal Information Injector (TII) and Temporal Affinity Refiner (TAR) at the beginning and end of cross-attention, respectively, to achieve frame-specific textual guidance. Firstly, TII injects frame-specific information from latent features into text conditions, thereby obtaining cross-frame textual conditions. Then, TAR refines the correlation matrix between cross-frame textual conditions and latent features along the time dimension. Extensive experiments comprising both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FancyVideo. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art T2V generation results on the EvalCrafter benchmark and facilitates the synthesis of dynamic and consistent videos. Note that the T2V process of FancyVideo essentially involves a text-to-image step followed by T+I2V. This means it also supports the generation of videos from user images, i.e., the image-to-video (I2V) task. A significant number of experiments have shown that its performance is also outstanding.

Abstract: Video demoireing aims to remove undesirable interference patterns that arise during the capture of screen content, restoring artifact-free frames while maintaining temporal consistency. Existing video demoireing methods typically utilize carefully designed alignment modules to estimate inter-frame motion for leveraging temporal information; however, these modules are often complex and computationally demanding. Meanwhile, recent works indicate that using raw data as input significantly enhances demoireing performance. Building on this insight, this paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It incorporates sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw video demoireing. The SMB employs a multi-directional scanning mechanism coupled with a learnable frequency compressor to effectively differentiate interference patterns across various orientations and frequencies, resulting in reduced artifacts, sharper edges, and faithful texture reconstruction. Concurrently, the TMB enhances temporal consistency by performing bidirectional scanning across the temporal sequences and integrating channel attention techniques, facilitating improved temporal information fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.6 dB in PSNR, and also delivers a satisfactory visual experience.

Abstract: While text-driven diffusion models demonstrate remarkable performance in image editing, the critical components of their text embeddings remain underexplored. The ambiguity and entanglement of these embeddings pose challenges for precise editing. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of text embeddings in Stable Diffusion XL, offering three key insights: (1) \textit{aug embedding}~\footnote{\textit{aug embedding} is obtained by combining the pooled output of the final text encoder with the timestep embeddings. https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers} retains complete textual semantics but contributes minimally to image generation as it is only fused via the ResBlocks. More text information weakens its local semantics while preserving most global semantics. (2) \textit{BOS} and \textit{padding embedding} do not contain any semantic information. (3) \textit{EOS} holds the semantic information of all words and stylistic information. Each word embedding is important and does not interfere with the semantic injection of other embeddings. Based on these insights, we propose PSP (\textbf{P}rompt-\textbf{S}oftbox-\textbf{P}rompt), a training-free image editing method that leverages free-text embedding. PSP enables precise image editing by modifying text embeddings within the cross-attention layers and using Softbox to control the specific area for semantic injection. This technique enables the addition and replacement of objects without affecting other areas of the image. Additionally, PSP can achieve style transfer by simply replacing text embeddings. Extensive experiments show that PSP performs remarkably well in tasks such as object replacement, object addition, and style transfer. Our code is available at https://github.com/yangyt46/PSP.

Abstract: Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models, however, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Our background-aware synthesis surpasses efficient baselines by 7.3\% and diffusion models by 3.0\% while being orders of magnitude faster, our drift-aware fine-tuning achieves Pareto optimality with 50\% fewer updates and 1.5\% higher accuracy, and the end-to-end system outperforms domain adaptation approaches by 20--35%\% while consuming only 11.2 Wh over 37 days -- enabling battery-powered deployment.

Abstract: This paper aims to shed light on the ethical problems of creating and deploying computer vision tech, particularly in using publicly available datasets. Due to the rapid growth of machine learning and artificial intelligence, computer vision has become a vital tool in many industries, including medical care, security systems, and trade. However, extensive use of visual data that is often collected without consent due to an informed discussion of its ramifications raises significant concerns about privacy and bias. The paper also examines these issues by analyzing popular datasets such as COCO, LFW, ImageNet, CelebA, PASCAL VOC, etc., that are usually used for training computer vision models. We offer a comprehensive ethical framework that addresses these challenges regarding the protection of individual rights, minimization of bias as well as openness and responsibility. We aim to encourage AI development that will take into account societal values as well as ethical standards to avoid any public harm.

Abstract: Accurate pain expression synthesis is essential for improving clinical training and human-robot interaction. Current Robotic Patient Simulators (RPSs) lack realistic pain facial expressions, limiting their effectiveness in medical training. In this work, we introduce PainDiffusion, a generative model that synthesizes naturalistic facial pain expressions. Unlike traditional heuristic or autoregressive methods, PainDiffusion operates in a continuous latent space, ensuring smoother and more natural facial motion while supporting indefinite-length generation via diffusion forcing. Our approach incorporates intrinsic characteristics such as pain expressiveness and emotion, allowing for personalized and controllable pain expression synthesis. We train and evaluate our model using the BioVid HeatPain Database. Additionally, we integrate PainDiffusion into a robotic system to assess its applicability in real-time rehabilitation exercises. Qualitative studies with clinicians reveal that PainDiffusion produces realistic pain expressions, with a 31.2% (std 4.8%) preference rate against ground-truth recordings. Our results suggest that PainDiffusion can serve as a viable alternative to real patients in clinical training and simulation, bridging the gap between synthetic and naturalistic pain expression.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure initially developed for early gastric cancer treatment and has expanded to address diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted surgery (CAS) systems enhance ESD precision and safety, their efficacy hinges on accurate real-time surgical phase recognition, a task complicated by ESD's inherent complexity, including heterogeneous lesion characteristics and dynamic tissue interactions. Existing video-based phase recognition algorithms, constrained by inefficient temporal context modeling, exhibit limited performance in capturing fine-grained phase transitions and long-range dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPRMamba, a novel framework integrating a Mamba-based architecture with a Scaled Residual TranMamba (SRTM) block to synergize long-term temporal modeling and localized detail extraction. SPRMamba further introduces the Hierarchical Sampling Strategy to optimize computational efficiency, enabling real-time processing critical for clinical deployment. Evaluated on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy benchmark Cholec80, SPRMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance (87.64% accuracy on ESD385, +1.0% over prior methods), demonstrating robust generalizability across surgical workflows. This advancement bridges the gap between computational efficiency and temporal sensitivity, offering a transformative tool for intraoperative guidance and skill assessment in ESD surgery. The code is accessible at https://github.com/Zxnyyyyy/SPRMamba.

Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated transformative potential across domains, yet its inherent opacity has driven the development of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which enforce interpretability through human-understandable concepts, represent a prominent advancement in XAI. However, despite their semantic transparency, CBMs remain vulnerable to security threats such as backdoor attacks malicious manipulations that induce controlled misbehaviors during inference. While CBMs leverage multimodal representations (visual inputs and textual concepts) to enhance interpretability, heir dual modality structure introduces new attack surfaces. To address the unexplored risk of concept-level backdoor attacks in multimodal XAI systems, we propose CAT (Concept-level Backdoor ATtacks), a methodology that injects triggers into conceptual representations during training, enabling precise prediction manipulation without compromising clean-data performance. An enhanced variant, CAT+, incorporates a concept correlation function to systematically optimize trigger-concept associations, thereby improving attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Through a comprehensive evaluation framework assessing attack success rate, stealth metrics, and model utility preservation, we demonstrate that CAT and CAT+ maintain high performance on clean data while achieving significant targeted effects on backdoored datasets. This work highlights critical security risks in interpretable AI systems and provides a robust methodology for future security assessments of CBMs.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of diffusion-based content generation, significant efforts are being made to unlearn harmful or copyrighted concepts from pretrained diffusion models (DMs) to prevent potential model misuse. However, it is observed that even when DMs are properly unlearned before release, malicious finetuning can compromise this process, causing DMs to relearn the unlearned concepts. This occurs partly because certain benign concepts (e.g., "skin") retained in DMs are related to the unlearned ones (e.g., "nudity"), facilitating their relearning via finetuning. To address this, we propose meta-unlearning on DMs. Intuitively, a meta-unlearned DM should behave like an unlearned DM when used as is; moreover, if the meta-unlearned DM undergoes malicious finetuning on unlearned concepts, the related benign concepts retained within it will be triggered to self-destruct, hindering the relearning of unlearned concepts. Our meta-unlearning framework is compatible with most existing unlearning methods, requiring only the addition of an easy-to-implement meta objective. We validate our approach through empirical experiments on meta-unlearning concepts from Stable Diffusion models (SD-v1-4 and SDXL), supported by extensive ablation studies. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Meta-Unlearning.

Abstract: Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.

Abstract: Training-free conditional generation based on flow matching aims to leverage pre-trained unconditional flow matching models to perform conditional generation without retraining. Recently, a successful training-free conditional generation approach incorporates conditions via posterior sampling, which relies on the availability of a score function in the unconditional diffusion model. However, flow matching models do not possess an explicit score function, rendering such a strategy inapplicable. Approximate posterior sampling for flow matching has been explored, but it is limited to linear inverse problems. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching-based Posterior Sampling (FMPS) to expand its application scope. We introduce a correction term by steering the velocity field. This correction term can be reformulated to incorporate a surrogate score function, thereby bridging the gap between flow matching models and score-based posterior sampling. Hence, FMPS enables the posterior sampling to be adjusted within the flow matching framework. Further, we propose two practical implementations of the correction mechanism: one aimed at improving generation quality, and the other focused on computational efficiency. Experimental results on diverse conditional generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation quality compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness and generality of FMPS.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in a 3D scene with natural language descriptions. Supervised methods have achieved decent accuracy, but have a closed vocabulary and limited language understanding ability. Zero-shot methods utilize large language models (LLMs) to handle natural language descriptions, where the LLM either produces grounding results directly or generates programs that compute results (symbolically). In this work, we propose a zero-shot method that reformulates the 3DVG task as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where the variables and constraints represent objects and their spatial relations, respectively. This allows a global symbolic reasoning of all relevant objects, producing grounding results of both the target and anchor objects. Moreover, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by handling negation- and counting-based queries with only minor extra coding efforts. Our system, Constraint Satisfaction Visual Grounding (CSVG), has been extensively evaluated on the public datasets ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets using only open-source LLMs. Results show the effectiveness of CSVG and superior grounding accuracy over current state-of-the-art zero-shot 3DVG methods with improvements of $+7.0\%$ (Acc@0.5 score) and $+11.2\%$ on the ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, respectively. The code of our system is available at https://asig-x.github.io/csvg_web.

Abstract: We propose Quadratic Gaussian Splatting (QGS), a novel representation that replaces static primitives with deformable quadric surfaces (e.g., ellipse, paraboloids) to capture intricate geometry. Unlike prior works that rely on Euclidean distance for primitive density modeling--a metric misaligned with surface geometry under deformation--QGS introduces geodesic distance-based density distributions. This innovation ensures that density weights adapt intrinsically to the primitive curvature, preserving consistency during shape changes (e.g., from planar disks to curved paraboloids). By solving geodesic distances in closed form on quadric surfaces, QGS enables surface-aware splatting, where a single primitive can represent complex curvature that previously required dozens of planar surfels, potentially reducing memory usage while maintaining efficient rendering via fast ray-quadric intersection. Experiments on DTU, Tanks and Temples, and MipNeRF360 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art surface reconstruction, with QGS reducing geometric error (chamfer distance) by 33% over 2DGS and 27% over GOF on the DTU dataset. Crucially, QGS retains competitive appearance quality, bridging the gap between geometric precision and visual fidelity for applications like robotics and immersive reality.

Abstract: Recent advances in video-large language models (Video-LLMs) have led to significant progress in video understanding. Current preference optimization methods often rely on proprietary APIs or human-annotated captions to generate preference data (i.e., pairs of model outputs ranked by quality or alignment with human judgment), which is then used to train models for video-language alignment. This approach is both costly and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we introduce VideoSAVi (Self-Aligned Video Language Model), a self-training pipeline that enables Video-LLMs to learn from video content without external supervision. Our approach includes a self-critiquing mechanism that identifies reasoning errors in the model's initial responses and generates improved alternatives, creating preference pairs directly from video content. VideoSAVi then applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to iteratively train the model using the preference data, thus enhancing its temporal and spatial reasoning for video understanding. Experiments show that VideoSAVi delivers significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including a +4.2 percentage point gain on MVBench, +3.9 on PerceptionTest, and +6.8 on the challenging EgoSchema dataset compared to baseline models. Our model-agnostic approach is computationally efficient, requiring only 32 frames, offering a promising direction for self-aligned video understanding without reliance on external models or annotations.

Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasting is critical for weather-sensitive decision-making in agriculture, transportation, and disaster response. Existing deep learning approaches often struggle to balance global structural consistency with local detail preservation, especially under complex meteorological conditions. We propose DuoCast, a dual-diffusion framework that decomposes precipitation forecasting into low- and high-frequency components modeled in orthogonal latent subspaces. We theoretically prove that this frequency decomposition reduces prediction error compared to conventional single branch U-Net diffusion models. In DuoCast, the low-frequency model captures large-scale trends via convolutional encoders conditioned on weather front dynamics, while the high-frequency model refines fine-scale variability using a self-attention-based architecture. Experiments on four benchmark radar datasets show that DuoCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in both spatial detail and temporal evolution.

Abstract: Physical adversarial patches printed on clothing can enable individuals to evade person detectors, but most existing methods prioritize attack effectiveness over stealthiness, resulting in aesthetically unpleasing patches. While generative adversarial networks and diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often fail to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these limitations, we propose BadPatch, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating customizable and naturalistic adversarial patches. Our approach allows users to start from a reference image (rather than random noise) and incorporates masks to create patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To preserve the original semantics during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Our method achieves attack performance comparable to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches while maintaining a natural appearance. Using BadPatch, we construct AdvT-shirt-1K, the first physical adversarial T-shirt dataset comprising over a thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. AdvT-shirt-1K can serve as a useful dataset for training or testing future defense methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled personalized image creation with both user-defined subjects (content) and styles. Prior works achieved personalization by merging corresponding low-rank adapters (LoRAs) through optimization-based methods, which are computationally demanding and unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained devices like smartphones. To address this, we introduce LoRA$.$rar, a method that not only improves image quality but also achieves a remarkable speedup of over $4000\times$ in the merging process. We collect a dataset of style and subject LoRAs and pre-train a hypernetwork on a diverse set of content-style LoRA pairs, learning an efficient merging strategy that generalizes to new, unseen content-style pairs, enabling fast, high-quality personalization. Moreover, we identify limitations in existing evaluation metrics for content-style quality and propose a new protocol using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for more accurate assessment. Our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art in both content and style fidelity, as validated by MLLM assessments and human evaluations.

Abstract: Realistic scene reconstruction in driving scenarios poses significant challenges due to fast-moving objects. Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our code will be made publicly available.

<title>FOF-X: Towards Real-time Detailed Human Reconstruction from a Single Image</title>

Abstract: We introduce FOF-X for real-time reconstruction of detailed human geometry from a single image. Balancing real-time speed against high-quality results is a persistent challenge, mainly due to the high computational demands of existing 3D representations. To address this, we propose Fourier Occupancy Field (FOF), an efficient 3D representation by learning the Fourier series. The core of FOF is to factorize a 3D occupancy field into a 2D vector field, retaining topology and spatial relationships within the 3D domain while facilitating compatibility with 2D convolutional neural networks. Such a representation bridges the gap between 3D and 2D domains, enabling the integration of human parametric models as priors and enhancing the reconstruction robustness. Based on FOF, we design a new reconstruction framework, FOF-X, to avoid the performance degradation caused by texture and lighting. This enables our real-time reconstruction system to better handle the domain gap between training images and real images. Additionally, in FOF-X, we enhance the inter-conversion algorithms between FOF and mesh representations with a Laplacian constraint and an automaton-based discontinuity matcher, improving both quality and robustness. We validate the strengths of our approach on different datasets and real-captured data, where FOF-X achieves new state-of-the-art results. The code has already been released for research purposes at https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/FOFX/index.html.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot recognition capability, but still underperform in dense prediction tasks. Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. DenseVLM leverages the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions and then decouples the interference between foreground and background features. We show that DenseVLM can directly replace the original VLM in open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation methods, leading to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, it exhibits promising zero-shot scalability when training on more extensive and diverse datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/HVision-NKU/DenseVLM.

Abstract: Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhuqiangLu/B-VLLM.

Abstract: We present TAR3D, a novel framework that consists of a 3D-aware Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) and a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to generate high-quality 3D assets. The core insight of this work is to migrate the multimodal unification and promising learning capabilities of the next-token prediction paradigm to conditional 3D object generation. To achieve this, the 3D VQ-VAE first encodes a wide range of 3D shapes into a compact triplane latent space and utilizes a set of discrete representations from a trainable codebook to reconstruct fine-grained geometries under the supervision of query point occupancy. Then, the 3D GPT, equipped with a custom triplane position embedding called TriPE, predicts the codebook index sequence with prefilling prompt tokens in an autoregressive manner so that the composition of 3D geometries can be modeled part by part. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet and Objaverse demonstrate that TAR3D can achieve superior generation quality over existing methods in text-to-3D and image-to-3D tasks

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) aims to localize moments within a video based on a given natural language query. Given the prevalent use of platforms like YouTube for information retrieval, the demand for MR techniques is significantly growing. Recent DETR-based models have made notable advances in performance but still struggle with accurately localizing short moments. Through data analysis, we identified limited feature diversity in short moments, which motivated the development of MomentMix. MomentMix employs two augmentation strategies: ForegroundMix and BackgroundMix, each enhancing the feature representations of the foreground and background, respectively. Additionally, our analysis of prediction bias revealed that short moments particularly struggle with accurately predicting their center positions of moments. To address this, we propose a Length-Aware Decoder, which conditions length through a novel bipartite matching process. Our extensive studies demonstrate the efficacy of our length-aware approach, especially in localizing short moments, leading to improved overall performance. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art DETR-based methods on benchmark datasets, achieving the highest R1 and mAP on QVHighlights and the highest R1@0.7 on TACoS and Charades-STA (such as a 2.46% gain in R1@0.7 and a 2.57% gain in mAP average for QVHighlights).

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at visual understanding, but face efficiency challenges due to quadratic complexity in processing long multi-modal contexts. While token compression can reduce computational costs, existing approaches are designed for single-view LVLMs and fail to consider the unique multi-view characteristics of high-resolution LVLMs with dynamic cropping. Existing methods treat all tokens uniformly, but our analysis reveals that global thumbnails can naturally guide the compression of local crops by providing holistic context for informativeness evaluation. In this paper, we first analyze dynamic cropping strategy, revealing both the complementary nature between thumbnails and crops, and the distinctive characteristics across different crops. Based on our observations, we propose "Global Compression Commander" (GlobalCom$^2$), a novel plug-and-play token compression framework for HR-LVLMs. GlobalCom$^2$ leverages thumbnail as the "commander" to guide the compression of local crops, adaptively preserving informative details while eliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments show that GlobalCom$^2$ maintains over 90% performance while compressing 90% visual tokens, reducing FLOPs and peak memory to 9.1% and 60%.

Abstract: Traditional Celluloid (Cel) Animation production pipeline encompasses multiple essential steps, including storyboarding, layout design, keyframe animation, inbetweening, and colorization, which demand substantial manual effort, technical expertise, and significant time investment. These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, challenges like visual consistency, stylistic coherence, and ethical considerations persist. Additionally, this paper explores future directions and advancements in AI-assisted animation.

Abstract: Modeling how humans interact with objects is crucial for AI to effectively assist or mimic human behaviors. Existing studies for learning such ability primarily focus on static human-object interaction (HOI) patterns, such as contact and spatial relationships, while dynamic HOI patterns, capturing the movement of humans and objects over time, remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning Dynamic Affordance across various target object categories. To address the scarcity of 4D HOI datasets, our method learns the 3D dynamic affordance from synthetically generated 4D HOI samples. Specifically, we propose a pipeline that first generates 2D HOI videos from a given 3D target object using a pre-trained video diffusion model, then lifts them into 3D to generate 4D HOI samples. Leveraging these synthesized 4D HOI samples, we train DAViD, our generative 4D human-object interaction model, which is composed of two key components: (1) a human motion diffusion model (MDM) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to fine-tune a pre-trained MDM to learn the HOI motion concepts from limited HOI motion samples, (2) a motion diffusion model for 4D object poses conditioned by produced human interaction motions. Interestingly, DAViD can integrate newly learned HOI motion concepts with pre-trained human motions to create novel HOI motions, even for multiple HOI motion concepts, demonstrating the advantage of our pipeline with LoRA in integrating dynamic HOI concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DAViD outperforms baselines in synthesizing HOI motion.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has achieved superior performance in novel view synthesis and 3D scene representation, but its practical applications are hindered by slow convergence and reliance on dense training views. To this end, we present DWTNeRF, a unified framework based on Instant-NGP's fast-training hash encoding. It is coupled with regularization terms designed for few-shot NeRF, which operates on sparse training views. Our DWTNeRF additionally includes a novel Discrete Wavelet loss that allows explicit prioritization of low frequencies directly in the training objective, reducing few-shot NeRF's overfitting on high frequencies in earlier training stages. We also introduce a model-based approach, based on multi-head attention, that is compatible with INGP, which are sensitive to architectural changes. On the 3-shot LLFF benchmark, DWTNeRF outperforms Vanilla INGP by 15.07% in PSNR, 24.45% in SSIM and 36.30% in LPIPS. Our approach encourages a re-thinking of current few-shot approaches for fast-converging implicit representations like INGP or 3DGS.

Abstract: Assigning realistic materials to 3D models remains a significant challenge in computer graphics. We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and lighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to static images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the dynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and lighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material renderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing conditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge the domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including LDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring explicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an object. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points on publicly available datasets. Our method can be used to construct material assignments for 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Objaverse. All code and data will be released.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their ability to understand multimodal input. However, their large parameter sizes and substantial computational demands severely hinder their practical deployment and application.While quantization is an effective way to reduce model size and inference latency, its application to MLLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Conventional quantization often struggles with MLLMs because of (a) high inference latency from large visual token counts, (b) distributional disparities between visual and textual tokens, and (c) extreme outliers introduced by Hadamard-based transformations. To address these issues, MQuant introduces: Modality-Specific Static Quantization (MSQ), assigning distinct static scales for visual vs. textual tokens; Attention-Invariant Flexible Switching (AIFS), reordering tokens to preserve casual attention while eliminating expensive token-wise scale computations; Rotation Magnitude Suppression (RMS), mitigating weight outliers arising from online Hadamard rotations. On five mainstream MLLMs (including Qwen-VL, MiniCPM-V, CogVLM2), MQuant under W4A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (<1% degradation) while reducing inference latency by up to 30%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ baselines. Our MQuant effectively bridges the gap for efficient and accurate MLLMs inference in resource-constrained devices. Code has been released in https://github.com/StiphyJay/MQuant.

Abstract: Generating cognitive-aligned layered SVGs remains challenging due to existing methods' tendencies toward either oversimplified single-layer outputs or optimization-induced shape redundancies. We propose LayerTracer, a diffusion transformer based framework that bridges this gap by learning designers' layered SVG creation processes from a novel dataset of sequential design operations. Our approach operates in two phases: First, a text-conditioned DiT generates multi-phase rasterized construction blueprints that simulate human design workflows. Second, layer-wise vectorization with path deduplication produces clean, editable SVGs. For image vectorization, we introduce a conditional diffusion mechanism that encodes reference images into latent tokens, guiding hierarchical reconstruction while preserving structural integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate LayerTracer's superior performance against optimization-based and neural baselines in both generation quality and editability, effectively aligning AI-generated vectors with professional design cognition.

Abstract: Purpose: An investigation of the challenge of annotating discrete segmentations of brain tumours in ultrasound, with a focus on the issue of aleatoric uncertainty along the tumour margin, particularly for diffuse tumours. A segmentation protocol and method is proposed that incorporates this margin-related uncertainty while minimising the interobserver variance through reduced subjectivity, thereby diminishing annotator epistemic uncertainty. Approach: A sparse confidence method for annotation is proposed, based on a protocol designed using computer vision and radiology theory. Results: Output annotations using the proposed method are compared with the corresponding professional discrete annotation variance between the observers. A linear relationship was measured within the tumour margin region, with a Pearson correlation of 0.8. The downstream application was explored, comparing training using confidence annotations as soft labels with using the best discrete annotations as hard labels. In all evaluation folds, the Brier score was superior for the soft-label trained network. Conclusion: A formal framework was constructed to demonstrate the infeasibility of discrete annotation of brain tumours in B-mode ultrasound. Subsequently, a method for sparse confidence-based annotation is proposed and evaluated. Keywords: Brain tumours, ultrasound, confidence, annotation.

Abstract: Occupancy estimation has become a prominent task in 3D computer vision, particularly within the autonomous driving community. In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.

Abstract: The MEDVQA-GI challenge addresses the integration of AI-driven text-to-image generative models in medical diagnostics, aiming to enhance diagnostic capabilities through synthetic image generation. Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are well known for their ability to produce highly realistic images, while multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are renowned for their proficiency in understanding and integrating multiple modalities. However, currently there is no straightforward and efficient framework to transfer the multimodal comprehension abilities of MLLMs to T2I models to enable them to understand multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose the X2I framework, which endows Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models with the capability to comprehend various modalities, including multilingual text, screenshot documents, images, videos, and audio. X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area. We further design a simple LightControl to enhance the fidelity of instructional image editing. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, multifunctionality, and transferability of our X2I.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a crucial capability for long-term autonomous robots, enabling them to identify previously visited locations using visual information. However, existing methods remain limited in indoor settings due to the highly repetitive structures inherent in such environments. We observe that scene texts frequently appear in indoor spaces and can help distinguish visually similar but different places. This inspires us to propose TextInPlace, a simple yet effective VPR framework that integrates Scene Text Spotting (STS) to mitigate visual perceptual ambiguity in repetitive indoor environments. Specifically, TextInPlace adopts a dual-branch architecture within a local parameter sharing network. The VPR branch employs attention-based aggregation to extract global descriptors for coarse-grained retrieval, while the STS branch utilizes a bridging text spotter to detect and recognize scene texts. Finally, the discriminative texts are filtered to compute text similarity and re-rank the top-K retrieved images. To bridge the gap between current text-based repetitive indoor scene datasets and the typical scenarios encountered in robot navigation, we establish an indoor VPR benchmark dataset, called Maze-with-Text. Extensive experiments on both custom and public datasets demonstrate that TextInPlace achieves superior performance over existing methods that rely solely on appearance information. The dataset, code, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/HqiTao/TextInPlace.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture has demonstrated significant successes in various computer vision tasks, such as classification and segmentation. However, its application to optical flow estimation remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce MambaFlow, a novel framework designed to leverage the high accuracy and efficiency of the Mamba architecture for capturing locally correlated features while preserving global information in end-to-end optical flow estimation. To our knowledge, MambaFlow is the first architecture centered around the Mamba design tailored specifically for optical flow estimation. It comprises two key components: (1) PolyMamba, which enhances feature representation through a dual-Mamba architecture, incorporating a Self-Mamba module for intra-token modeling and a Cross-Mamba module for inter-modality interaction, enabling both deep contextualization and effective feature fusion; and (2) PulseMamba, which leverages an Attention Guidance Aggregator (AGA) to adaptively integrate features with dynamically learned weights in contrast to naive concatenation, and then employs the intrinsic recurrent mechanism of Mamba to perform autoregressive flow decoding, facilitating efficient flow information dissemination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaFlow achieves remarkable results comparable to mainstream methods on benchmark datasets. Compared to SEA-RAFT, MambaFlow attains higher accuracy on the Sintel benchmark, demonstrating stronger potential for real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

<title>Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models for Text-to-Image Generation through Autoregressive Representation Alignment</title>

Abstract: We present Autoregressive Representation Alignment (ARRA), a new training framework that unlocks global-coherent text-to-image generation in autoregressive LLMs without architectural modifications. Different from prior works that require complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM's hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, [object Object]. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training T2I LLMs from scratch, ARRA reduces FID by 16.6% (ImageNet), 12.0% (LAION-COCO) for autoregressive LLMs like LlamaGen, without modifying original architecture and inference mechanism. For training from text-generation-only LLMs, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet) for advanced LLMs like Chameleon. For domain adaptation, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). These results demonstrate that training objective redesign, rather than architectural modifications, can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges. ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models. The code is available at https://github.com/xiexing0916/ARRA.

<title>From Limited Labels to Open Domains:An Efficient Learning Method for Drone-view Geo-Localization</title>

Abstract: Traditional supervised drone-view geo-localization (DVGL) methods heavily depend on paired training data and encounter difficulties in learning cross-view correlations from unpaired data. Moreover, when deployed in a new domain, these methods require obtaining the new paired data and subsequent retraining for model adaptation, which significantly increases computational overhead. Existing unsupervised methods have enabled to generate pseudo-labels based on cross-view similarity to infer the pairing relationships. However, geographical similarity and spatial continuity often cause visually analogous features at different geographical locations. The feature confusion compromises the reliability of pseudo-label generation, where incorrect pseudo-labels drive negative optimization. Given these challenges inherent in both supervised and unsupervised DVGL methods, we propose a novel cross-domain invariant knowledge transfer network (CDIKTNet) with limited supervision, whose architecture consists of a cross-domain invariance sub-network (CDIS) and a cross-domain transfer sub-network (CDTS). This architecture facilitates a closed-loop framework for invariance feature learning and knowledge transfer. The CDIS is designed to learn cross-view structural and spatial invariance from a small amount of paired data that serves as prior knowledge. It endows the shared feature space of unpaired data with similar implicit cross-view correlations at initialization, which alleviates feature confusion. Based on this, the CDTS employs dual-path contrastive learning to further optimize each subspace while preserving consistency in a shared feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDIKTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under full supervision compared with those supervised methods, and further surpasses existing unsupervised methods in both few-shot and cross-domain initialization.

Abstract: The concept of 3D scene graphs is increasingly recognized as a powerful semantic and hierarchical representation of the environment. Current approaches often address this at a coarse, object-level resolution. In contrast, our goal is to develop a representation that enables robots to directly interact with their environment by identifying both the location of functional interactive elements and how these can be used. To achieve this, we focus on detecting and storing objects at a finer resolution, focusing on affordance-relevant parts. The primary challenge lies in the scarcity of data that extends beyond instance-level detection and the inherent difficulty of capturing detailed object features using robotic sensors. We leverage currently available 3D resources to generate 2D data and train a detector, which is then used to augment the standard 3D scene graph generation pipeline. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves functional element segmentation comparable to state-of-the-art 3D models and that our augmentation enables task-driven affordance grounding with higher accuracy than the current solutions.

Abstract: While the quality of novel-view images has improved dramatically with 3D Gaussian Splatting, extracting specific objects from scenes remains challenging. Isolating individual 3D Gaussian primitives for each object and handling occlusions in scenes remains far from being solved. We propose a novel object extraction method based on two key principles: (1) object-centric reconstruction through removal of irrelevant primitives; and (2) leveraging generative inpainting to compensate for missing observations caused by occlusions. For pruning, we propose to remove irrelevant Gaussians by looking into how close they are to its K-nearest neighbors and removing those that are statistical outliers. Importantly, these distances must take into account the actual spatial extent they cover -- we thus propose to use Wasserstein distances. For inpainting, we employ an off-the-shelf diffusion-based inpainter combined with occlusion reasoning, utilizing the 3D representation of the entire scene. Our findings highlight the crucial synergy between proper pruning and inpainting, both of which significantly enhance extraction performance. We evaluate our method on a standard real-world dataset and introduce a synthetic dataset for quantitative analysis. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness in object extraction from complex scenes.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) enables strong generalization from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, often with limited data. In parallel, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained at scale without labels have also shown impressive downstream performance and generalization. This motivates us to explore how UDA can best leverage VFMs. Prior work (VFM-UDA) demonstrated that replacing a standard ImageNet-pretrained encoder with a VFM improves generalization. However, it also showed that commonly used feature distance losses harm performance when applied to VFMs. Additionally, VFM-UDA does not incorporate multi-scale inductive biases, which are known to improve semantic segmentation. Building on these insights, we propose VFM-UDA++, which (1) investigates the role of multi-scale features, (2) adapts feature distance loss to be compatible with ViT-based VFMs and (3) evaluates how UDA benefits from increased synthetic source and real target data. By addressing these questions, we can improve performance on the standard GTA5 $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes benchmark by +1.4 mIoU. While prior non-VFM UDA methods did not scale with more data, VFM-UDA++ shows consistent improvement and achieves a further +2.4 mIoU gain when scaling the data, demonstrating that VFM-based UDA continues to benefit from increased data availability.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is a cornerstone for image-to-3d creation. However, existing works still struggle to maintain consistency between the generated views and the input views, especially when there is a significant camera pose difference, leading to poor-quality 3D geometries and textures. We attribute this issue to their treatment of all target views with equal priority according to our empirical observation that the target views closer to the input views exhibit higher fidelity. With this inspiration, we propose AR-1-to-3, a novel next-view prediction paradigm based on diffusion models that first generates views close to the input views, which are then utilized as contextual information to progressively synthesize farther views. To encode the generated view subsequences as local and global conditions for the next-view prediction, we accordingly develop a stacked local feature encoding strategy (Stacked-LE) and an LSTM-based global feature encoding strategy (LSTM-GE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the consistency between the generated views and the input views, producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as a leading architecture for text-to-image synthesis, producing high-quality and photorealistic images. However, the quadratic scaling properties of the attention in DiTs hinder image generation with higher resolution or on devices with limited resources. This work introduces an efficient diffusion transformer (EDiT) to alleviate these efficiency bottlenecks in conventional DiTs and Multimodal DiTs (MM-DiTs). First, we present a novel linear compressed attention method that uses a multi-layer convolutional network to modulate queries with local information while keys and values are aggregated spatially. Second, we formulate a hybrid attention scheme for multimodal inputs that combines linear attention for image-to-image interactions and standard scaled dot-product attention for interactions involving prompts. Merging these two approaches leads to an expressive, linear-time Multimodal Efficient Diffusion Transformer (MM-EDiT). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EDiT and MM-EDiT architectures by integrating them into PixArt-Sigma (conventional DiT) and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Medium (MM-DiT), achieving up to 2.2x speedup with comparable image quality after distillation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) can generate short photorealistic videos, yet directly training and sampling longer videos with full attention across the video remains computationally challenging. Alternative methods break long videos down into sequential generation of short video segments, requiring multiple sampling chain iterations and specialized consistency modules. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new paradigm called Video Interface Networks (VINs), which augment DiTs with an abstraction module to enable parallel inference of video chunks. At each diffusion step, VINs encode global semantics from the noisy input of local chunks and the encoded representations, in turn, guide DiTs in denoising chunks in parallel. The coupling of VIN and DiT is learned end-to-end on the denoising objective. Further, the VIN architecture maintains fixed-size encoding tokens that encode the input via a single cross-attention step. Disentangling the encoding tokens from the input thus enables VIN to scale to long videos and learn essential semantics. Experiments on VBench demonstrate that VINs surpass existing chunk-based methods in preserving background consistency and subject coherence. We then show via an optical flow analysis that our approach attains state-of-the-art motion smoothness while using 25-40% fewer FLOPs than full generation. Finally, human raters favorably assessed the overall video quality and temporal consistency of our method in a user study.

Abstract: We present a method for learning 3D spatial relationships between object pairs, referred to as object-object spatial relationships (OOR), by leveraging synthetically generated 3D samples from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. We hypothesize that images synthesized by 2D diffusion models inherently capture realistic OOR cues, enabling efficient collection of a 3D dataset to learn OOR for various unbounded object categories. Our approach synthesizes diverse images that capture plausible OOR cues, which we then uplift into 3D samples. Leveraging our diverse collection of 3D samples for the object pairs, we train a score-based OOR diffusion model to learn the distribution of their relative spatial relationships. Additionally, we extend our pairwise OOR to multi-object OOR by enforcing consistency across pairwise relations and preventing object collisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method across various object-object spatial relationships, along with its applicability to 3D scene arrangement tasks and human motion synthesis using our OOR diffusion model.

Abstract: Gait analysis is crucial for the diagnosis and monitoring of movement disorders like Parkinson's Disease. While computer vision models have shown potential for objectively evaluating parkinsonian gait, their effectiveness is limited by scarce clinical datasets and the challenge of collecting large and well-labelled data, impacting model accuracy and risk of bias. To address these gaps, we propose GAITGen, a novel framework that generates realistic gait sequences conditioned on specified pathology severity levels. GAITGen employs a Conditional Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder to learn disentangled representations of motion dynamics and pathology-specific factors, coupled with Mask and Residual Transformers for conditioned sequence generation. GAITGen generates realistic, diverse gait sequences across severity levels, enriching datasets and enabling large-scale model training in parkinsonian gait analysis. Experiments on our new PD-GaM (real) dataset demonstrate that GAITGen outperforms adapted state-of-the-art models in both reconstruction fidelity and generation quality, accurately capturing critical pathology-specific gait features. A clinical user study confirms the realism and clinical relevance of our generated sequences. Moreover, incorporating GAITGen-generated data into downstream tasks improves parkinsonian gait severity estimation, highlighting its potential for advancing clinical gait analysis.

Abstract: Leukemia is the 10th most frequently diagnosed cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Realistic analysis of leukemia requires white blood cell (WBC) localization, classification, and morphological assessment. Despite deep learning advances in medical imaging, leukemia analysis lacks a large, diverse multi-task dataset, while existing small datasets lack domain diversity, limiting real-world applicability. To overcome dataset challenges, we present a large-scale WBC dataset named Large Leukemia Dataset (LLD) and novel methods for detecting WBC with their attributes. Our contribution here is threefold. First, we present a large-scale Leukemia dataset collected through Peripheral Blood Films (PBF) from 48 patients, through multiple microscopes, multi-cameras, and multi-magnification. To enhance diagnosis explainability and medical expert acceptance, each leukemia cell is annotated at 100x with 7 morphological attributes, ranging from Cell Size to Nuclear Shape. Secondly, we propose a multi-task model that not only detects WBCs but also predicts their attributes, providing an interpretable and clinically meaningful solution. Third, we propose a method for WBC detection with attribute analysis using sparse annotations. This approach reduces the annotation burden on hematologists, requiring them to mark only a small area within the field of view. Our method enables the model to leverage the entire field of view rather than just the annotated regions, enhancing learning efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. From diagnosis explainability to overcoming domain-shift challenges, the presented datasets can be used for many challenging aspects of microscopic image analysis. The datasets, code, and demo are available at: https://im.itu.edu.pk/sparse-leukemiaattri/

Abstract: Building general-purpose models that can effectively perceive the world through multimodal signals has been a long-standing goal. Current approaches involve integrating separately pre-trained components, such as connecting vision encoders to LLMs and continuing multimodal training. While such approaches exhibit remarkable sample efficiency, it remains an open question whether such late-fusion architectures are inherently superior. In this work, we revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)-those trained from the ground up on all modalities-and conduct an extensive scaling laws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and training mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to late-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image encoders or tokenizers. On the contrary, early-fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower parameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy. Motivated by the strong performance of the early-fusion architectures, we show that incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoEs) allows models to learn modality-specific weights, significantly benefiting performance.

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to recognize novel action categories with few exemplars. Existing methods typically learn frame-level representations for each video by designing inter-frame temporal modeling strategies or inter-video interaction at the coarse video-level granularity. However, they treat each episode task in isolation and neglect fine-grained temporal relation modeling between videos, thus failing to capture shared fine-grained temporal patterns across videos and reuse temporal knowledge from historical tasks. In light of this, we propose HR2G-shot, a Hierarchical Relation-augmented Representation Generalization framework for FSAR, which unifies three types of relation modeling (inter-frame, inter-video, and inter-task) to learn task-specific temporal patterns from a holistic view. Going beyond conducting inter-frame temporal interactions, we further devise two components to respectively explore inter-video and inter-task relationships: i) Inter-video Semantic Correlation (ISC) performs cross-video frame-level interactions in a fine-grained manner, thereby capturing task-specific query features and enhancing both intra-class consistency and inter-class separability; ii) Inter-task Knowledge Transfer (IKT) retrieves and aggregates relevant temporal knowledge from the bank, which stores diverse temporal patterns from historical episode tasks. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that HR2G-shot outperforms current top-leading FSAR methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has seen groundbreaking advancements with diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity synthesis and precise image editing through cross-attention manipulation. Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have re-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match diffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion models fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences in structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/hutaiHang/ATM

Abstract: Detecting empathy from video interactions is an emerging area of research, particularly in healthcare and social robotics. However, privacy and ethical concerns often prevent the release of raw video data, with many datasets instead shared as pre-extracted tabular features. Previous work on such datasets has established classical tree-based models as the state of the art. Motivated by recent successes of large-scale foundation models for text, we investigate the potential of tabular foundation models (TFMs) for empathy detection from video-derived tabular data. Our proposed system, TFMPathy, is demonstrated with two recent TFMs (TabPFN v2 and TabICL) under both in-context learning and fine-tuning paradigms. On a public human-robot interaction benchmark, TFMPathy significantly improves empathy detection accuracy reported in the literature. While the established evaluation protocol in the literature does not ensure cross-subject generalisation, our evaluation scheme also captures such generalisation. We show that TFMPathy under a fine-tuning setup has better cross-subject generalisation capacity over baseline methods (accuracy: $0.590 \rightarrow 0.730$; AUC: $0.564 \rightarrow 0.669$). Given the ongoing privacy and ethical constraints around raw video sharing, the proposed TFMPathy system provides a practical and scalable path toward building AI systems dependent on human-centred video datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/TFMPathy (will be made available upon acceptance of this paper).

Abstract: Anomaly Detection involves identifying deviations from normal data distributions and is critical in fields such as medical diagnostics and industrial defect detection. Traditional AD methods typically require the availability of normal training samples; however, this assumption is not always feasible. Recently, the rich pretraining knowledge of CLIP has shown promising zero-shot generalization in detecting anomalies without the need for training samples from target domains. However, CLIP's coarse-grained image-text alignment limits localization and detection performance for fine-grained anomalies due to: (1) spatial misalignment, and (2) the limited sensitivity of global features to local anomalous patterns. In this paper, we propose Crane which tackles both problems. First, we introduce a correlation-based attention module to retain spatial alignment more accurately. Second, to boost the model's awareness of fine-grained anomalies, we condition the learnable prompts of the text encoder on image context extracted from the vision encoder and perform a local-to-global representation fusion. Moreover, our method can incorporate vision foundation models such as DINOv2 to further enhance spatial understanding and localization. The key insight of Crane is to balance learnable adaptations for modeling anomalous concepts with non-learnable adaptations that preserve and exploit generalized pretrained knowledge, thereby minimizing in-domain overfitting and maximizing performance on unseen domains. Extensive evaluation across 14 diverse industrial and medical datasets demonstrates that Crane consistently improves the state-of-the-art ZSAD from 2% to 28%, at both image and pixel levels, while remaining competitive in inference speed.

Abstract: Rapid, accurate, and descriptive building damage assessment is critical for directing post-disaster resources, yet current automated methods typically provide only binary (damaged/undamaged) or ordinal severity scales. This paper introduces DamageCAT, a framework that advances damage assessment through typology-based categorical classifications. We contribute: (1) the BD-TypoSAT dataset containing satellite image triplets from Hurricane Ida with four damage categories - partial roof damage, total roof damage, partial structural collapse, and total structural collapse - and (2) a hierarchical U-Net-based transformer architecture for processing pre- and post-disaster image pairs. Our model achieves 0.737 IoU and 0.846 F1-score overall, with cross-event evaluation demonstrating transferability across Hurricane Harvey, Florence, and Michael data. While performance varies across damage categories due to class imbalance, the framework shows that typology-based classifications can provide more actionable damage assessments than traditional severity-based approaches, enabling targeted emergency response and resource allocation.

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings, while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly, while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality, yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how multimodal meaning is constructed.

Abstract: Fine-grained object counting remains a major challenge for class-agnostic counting models, which overcount visually similar but incorrect instances (e.g., jalape\~no vs. poblano). Addressing this by annotating new data and fully retraining the model is time-consuming and does not guarantee generalization to additional novel categories at test time. Instead, we propose an alternative paradigm: Given a category name, tune a compact concept embedding derived from the prompt using synthetic images and pseudo-labels generated by a text-to-image diffusion model. This embedding conditions a specialization module that refines raw overcounts from any frozen counter into accurate, category-specific estimates\textemdash without requiring real images or human annotations. We validate our approach on \textsc{Lookalikes}, a challenging new benchmark containing 1,037 images across 27 fine-grained subcategories, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: As an open research topic in the field of deep learning, learning with noisy labels has attracted much attention and grown rapidly over the past ten years. Learning with label noise is crucial for driver distraction behavior recognition, as real-world video data often contains mislabeled samples, impacting model reliability and performance. However, label noise learning is barely explored in the driver activity recognition field. In this paper, we propose the first label noise learning approach for the driver activity recognition task. Based on the cluster assumption, we initially enable the model to learn clustering-friendly low-dimensional representations from given videos and assign the resultant embeddings into clusters. We subsequently perform co-refinement within each cluster to smooth the classifier outputs. Furthermore, we propose a flexible sample selection strategy that combines two selection criteria without relying on any hyperparameters to filter clean samples from the training dataset. We also incorporate a self-adaptive parameter into the sample selection process to enforce balancing across classes. A comprehensive variety of experiments on the public Drive&amp;Act dataset for all granularity levels demonstrates the superior performance of our method in comparison with other label-denoising methods derived from the image classification field.

Abstract: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to new domains with few labeled samples remains a significant challenge due to severe overfitting and computational constraints. State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \textit{local sparsity and global density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for \textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory overhead.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved success on multiple downstream tasks by aligning image and text modalities. However, the nature of global contrastive learning limits CLIP's ability to comprehend compositional concepts, such as relations and attributes. Although recent studies employ global hard negative samples to improve compositional understanding, these methods significantly compromise the model's inherent general capabilities by forcibly distancing textual negative samples from images in the embedding space. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional understanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities. To optimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a self-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the learnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an exponential moving average. Under the constraint of self-distillation, it effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct about 2M high-quality negative captions across five types. Subsequently, we propose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to enhance vision-language compositionally. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across the VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. Concurrently, it obtains an average performance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across eleven datasets. Our code will be released at https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has achieved remarkable success in text-to-3D content generation. However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Our framework, CoherenDream, achieves consistent improvement across multiple metrics on TIFA subset.As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data compression is crucial for enabling efficient storage and transmission in 3D scene modeling. However, its development remains limited due to inadequate entropy models and suboptimal quantization strategies for both lossless and lossy compression scenarios, where existing methods have yet to 1) fully leverage hyperprior information to construct robust conditional entropy models, and 2) apply fine-grained, element-wise quantization strategies for improved compression granularity. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to simultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior information through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior features, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating mechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is utilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling. Meanwhile, for lossy compression, we employ the MoP feature as guidance information in an element-wise quantization procedure, leveraging a prior-guided Coarse-to-Fine Quantization (C2FQ) strategy with a predefined quantization step value. Specifically, we expand the quantization step value into a matrix and adaptively refine it from coarse to fine granularity, guided by the MoP feature, thereby obtaining a quantization step matrix that facilitates element-wise quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DGS data compression framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Mip-NeRF360, BungeeNeRF, DeepBlending, and Tank&amp;Temples.

Abstract: Surface reconstruction is fundamental to computer vision and graphics, enabling applications in 3D modeling, mixed reality, robotics, and more. Existing approaches based on volumetric rendering obtain promising results, but optimize on a per-scene basis, resulting in a slow optimization that can struggle to model under-observed or textureless regions. We introduce QuickSplat, which learns data-driven priors to generate dense initializations for 2D gaussian splatting optimization of large-scale indoor scenes. This provides a strong starting point for the reconstruction, which accelerates the convergence of the optimization and improves the geometry of flat wall structures. We further learn to jointly estimate the densification and update of the scene parameters during each iteration; our proposed densifier network predicts new Gaussians based on the rendering gradients of existing ones, removing the needs of heuristics for densification. Extensive experiments on large-scale indoor scene reconstruction demonstrate the superiority of our data-driven optimization. Concretely, we accelerate runtime by 8x, while decreasing depth errors by up to 48% in comparison to state of the art methods.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems primarily focus on manual gestures, but non-manual features such as mouth movements, specifically mouthing, provide valuable linguistic information. This work directly classifies mouthing instances to their corresponding words in the spoken language while exploring the potential of transfer learning from Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) to mouthing recognition in German Sign Language. We leverage three VSR datasets: one in English, one in German with unrelated words and one in German containing the same target words as the mouthing dataset, to investigate the impact of task similarity in this setting. Our results demonstrate that multi-task learning improves both mouthing recognition and VSR accuracy as well as model robustness, suggesting that mouthing recognition should be treated as a distinct but related task to VSR. This research contributes to the field of SLR by proposing knowledge transfer from VSR to SLR datasets with limited mouthing annotations.

Abstract: Supervised pretrained models have become widely used in deep learning, especially for image segmentation tasks. However, when applied to specialized datasets such as biomedical imaging, pretrained weights often introduce unintended biases. These biases cause models to assign different levels of importance to different slices, leading to inconsistencies in feature utilization, which can be observed as asymmetries in saliency map distributions. This transfer of color distributions from natural images to non-natural datasets can compromise model performance and reduce the reliability of results. In this study, we investigate the effects of these biases and propose strategies to mitigate them. Through a series of experiments, we test both pretrained and randomly initialized models, comparing their performance and saliency map distributions. Our proposed methods, which aim to neutralize the bias introduced by pretrained color channel weights, demonstrate promising results, offering a practical approach to improving model explainability while maintaining the benefits of pretrained models. This publication presents our findings, providing insights into addressing pretrained weight biases across various deep learning tasks.

Abstract: Intra-operative data captured during image-guided surgery lacks sub-surface information, where key regions of interest, such as vessels and tumors, reside. Image-to-physical registration enables the fusion of pre-operative information and intra-operative data, typically represented as a point cloud. However, this registration process struggles due to partial visibility of the intra-operative point cloud. In this research, we propose a patient-specific point cloud completion approach to assist with the registration process. Specifically, we leverage VN-OccNet to generate a complete liver surface from a partial intra-operative point cloud. The network is trained in a patient-specific manner, where simulated deformations from the pre-operative model are used to train the model. First, we conduct an in-depth analysis of VN-OccNet's rotation-equivariant property and its effectiveness in recovering complete surfaces from partial intra-operative surfaces. Next, we integrate the completed intra-operative surface into the Go-ICP registration algorithm to demonstrate its utility in improving initial rigid registration outcomes. Our results highlight the promise of this patient-specific completion approach in mitigating the challenges posed by partial intra-operative visibility. The rotation equivariant and surface generation capabilities of VN-OccNet hold strong promise for developing robust registration frameworks for variations of the intra-operative point cloud.

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-Identification (ReID) aims to obtain accurate identity features across heterogeneous modalities. However, most existing methods rely on implicit feature fusion modules, making it difficult to model fine-grained recognition patterns under various challenges in real world. Benefiting from the powerful Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the object appearances are effectively translated into descriptive captions. In this paper, we propose a reliable caption generation pipeline based on attribute confidence, which significantly reduces the unknown recognition rate of MLLMs and improves the quality of generated text. Additionally, to model diverse identity patterns, we propose a novel ReID framework, named NEXT, the Multi-grained Mixture of Experts via Text-Modulation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification. Specifically, we decouple the recognition problem into semantic and structural branches to separately capture fine-grained appearance features and coarse-grained structure features. For semantic recognition, we first propose a Text-Modulated Semantic Experts (TMSE), which randomly samples high-quality captions to modulate experts capturing semantic features and mining inter-modality complementary cues. Second, to recognize structure features, we propose a Context-Shared Structure Experts (CSSE), which focuses on the holistic object structure and maintains identity structural consistency via a soft routing mechanism. Finally, we propose a Multi-Grained Features Aggregation (MGFA), which adopts a unified fusion strategy to effectively integrate multi-grained experts into the final identity representations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that it significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Video inbetweening aims to synthesize intermediate video sequences conditioned on the given start and end frames. Current state-of-the-art methods primarily extend large-scale pre-trained Image-to-Video Diffusion Models (I2V-DMs) by incorporating the end-frame condition via direct fine-tuning or temporally bidirectional sampling. However, the former results in a weak end-frame constraint, while the latter inevitably disrupts the input representation of video frames, leading to suboptimal performance. To improve the end-frame constraint while avoiding disruption of the input representation, we propose a novel video inbetweening framework specific to recent and more powerful transformer-based I2V-DMs, termed EF-VI. It efficiently strengthens the end-frame constraint by utilizing an enhanced injection. This is based on our proposed well-designed lightweight module, termed EF-Net, which encodes only the end frame and expands it into temporally adaptive frame-wise features injected into the I2V-DM. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our EF-VI compared with other baselines.

Abstract: Generating images from rhetorical languages remains a critical challenge for text-to-image models. Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language models (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in rhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual representations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize object-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to steer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended semantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that formulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy optimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the outer layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated sub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing semantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward sparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing every adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical text-to-image generation. Our model outperforms SOTA MLLMs such as GPT-4o, Grok-3 and leading academic baselines across both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion-based garment synthesis tasks primarily focus on the design phase in the fashion domain, while the garment production process remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: Flat Sketch to Realistic Garment Image (FS2RG), which generates realistic garment images by integrating flat sketches and textual guidance. FS2RG presents two key challenges: 1) fabric characteristics are solely guided by textual prompts, providing insufficient visual supervision for diffusion-based models, which limits their ability to capture fine-grained fabric details; 2) flat sketches and textual guidance may provide conflicting information, requiring the model to selectively preserve or modify garment attributes while maintaining structural coherence. To tackle this task, we propose HiGarment, a novel framework that comprises two core components: i) a multi-modal semantic enhancement mechanism that enhances fabric representation across textual and visual modalities, and ii) a harmonized cross-attention mechanism that dynamically balances information from flat sketches and text prompts, allowing controllable synthesis by generating either sketch-aligned (image-biased) or text-guided (text-biased) outputs. Furthermore, we collect Multi-modal Detailed Garment, the largest open-source dataset for garment generation. Experimental results and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGarment in garment synthesis. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Maple498/HiGarment.

Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has led to significant progress in video generation but also raises serious concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing. Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/hardenyu21/Video-Signature}{here}

Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning, performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes \textit{SVarM} to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) often struggle to interpret high-resolution images accurately, where fine-grained details are crucial for complex visual understanding. We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and \textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by \textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit, high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm, and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths. Code and prompts are open-sourced for reproducibility at https://github.com/glerium/Thought-Graph-Traversal.

Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic, inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i) Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement, which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for novel view synthesis, offering real-time rendering with high visual fidelity. However, its substantial storage requirements present significant challenges for practical applications. While recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods increasingly incorporate dedicated compression modules, there is a lack of a comprehensive framework to evaluate their perceptual impact. Therefore we present 3DGS-IEval-15K, the first large-scale image quality assessment (IQA) dataset specifically designed for compressed 3DGS representations. Our dataset encompasses 15,200 images rendered from 10 real-world scenes through 6 representative 3DGS algorithms at 20 strategically selected viewpoints, with different compression levels leading to various distortion effects. Through controlled subjective experiments, we collect human perception data from 60 viewers. We validate dataset quality through scene diversity and MOS distribution analysis, and establish a comprehensive benchmark with 30 representative IQA metrics covering diverse types. As the largest-scale 3DGS quality assessment dataset to date, our work provides a foundation for developing 3DGS specialized IQA metrics, and offers essential data for investigating view-dependent quality distribution patterns unique to 3DGS. The database is publicly available at https://github.com/YukeXing/3DGS-IEval-15K.

<title>CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.

Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the 3D regions simultaneously visible in multiple images-even when these images are sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This ability is foundational to 3D vision, robotic perception, and relies not only on low-level feature matching but also on high-level spatial reasoning and cognitive integration. Yet, it remains unclear whether current vision models can replicate this human-level proficiency. In this work, we introduce the Co-VisiON benchmark, designed to evaluate human-inspired co-visibility reasoning across more than 1,000 sparse-view indoor scenarios. Our results show that while co-visibility is often approached as a low-level feature-matching task, it remains challenging for existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary vision-language model surpasses all vision-only baselines, but all models fall significantly short of human performance. This gap underscores the limitations of current architectures and motivates the need for models that integrate spatial and semantic information in a human-like manner. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of robust, cognitively inspired reasoning in challenging, sparse environments.

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

Abstract: Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System, which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4 addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving performance comparable to that of 8B models.

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors. Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering ($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and affinity to segment the sequences of frames in video. Specifically, the structured representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ enjoy temporally consistency and are aligned well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for addressing the HMS task. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors. The code is available at: https://github.com/mengxianghan123/TR2C.

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating. While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning, layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MusiXQA, the first comprehensive dataset for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in music sheet understanding.

Beyond benchmarking, we developed Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant performance gains over GPT-based methods. The proposed dataset and model establish a foundation for future advances in MLLMs for music sheet understanding. Code, data, and model will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL) events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree. Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the efficiency of their simulations.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, GPT-4o, Grok-4) compare against a domain-specific face recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task? Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and benchmark datasets, we report the following findings: (a) In all face benchmark datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improved on over-segmented face images compared to tightly cropped faces, thereby suggesting the importance of contextual clues. (c) A simple score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific face recognition model improved the accuracy at low false match rates. (d) Foundation models, such as GPT-4o and Grok-4, are able to provide explainability to the face recognition pipeline. In some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence decisions made by AdaFace, thereby reiterating the importance of combining domain-specific face recognition models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation, and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes, and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations: inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2) Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks, offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with the latent related semantics of the  token. To quantify this relationship and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Abstract: Multiple object tracking (MOT) technology has made significant progress in terrestrial applications, but underwater tracking scenarios remain underexplored despite their importance to marine ecology and aquaculture. In this paper, we present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring 15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments, fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar appearances, and erratic motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework featuring an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) optimized for non-linear swimming patterns of fish and a novel Fish-Intersection-over-Union (FishIoU) matching that accounts for the unique morphological characteristics of aquatic species. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance on MFT25, with 34.1 HOTA and 44.6 IDF1, while revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object tracking scenarios.

Abstract: Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems, and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning process. Simulation results demonstrate that our visual backbone can focus more on task-related regions and exhibit better generalization in unseen scenarios. For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to deploy domain randomization over training processes. Finally, the feasibility of our model is validated to perform real-world manipulation tasks via zero-shot transfer.

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) determines the geo-location within a prebuilt map and plays a crucial role in geoscience and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of a geographic positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

<title>RAPNet: A Receptive-Field Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening</title>

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows, encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer learning approaches. To identify the optimal time-series generation approaches and supervised crop mapping models, we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift. The evaluation of optimal methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally, workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop mapping. All code is publicly available to encourage reproducibility practice.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of educational applications, artistic creation, and AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and professional understanding. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA methods demonstrate stronger perceptual and generalization capabilities compared to traditional approaches, yet they suffer from modality bias (score-only or text-only) and lack fine-grained attribute decomposition, thereby failing to support further aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we present:(1) ArtiMuse, an innovative MLLM-based IAA model with Joint Scoring and Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main categories and 15 subcategories, each annotated by professional experts with 8-dimensional attributes analysis and a holistic score. Both the model and dataset will be made public to advance the field.

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically, our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models. The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images, pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at https://github.com/sunwei925/Efficient-FIQA.git.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods, leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia-->Cityscapes.

<title>A New One-Shot Federated Learning Framework for Medical Imaging Classification with Feature-Guided Rectified Flow and Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement, and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding. Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges, including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue, we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing. Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Howardkhh/FROSS.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D facial animation.

<title>TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for MLLM Hallucination Reduction</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism. Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views; however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations, we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to limited 3D training data, such a 3D model alone cannot capture all image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior, ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as model inversion by fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The generative avatar provides an initialization for model fitting, enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose. Experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy. However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network (SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers: SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy (0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2) Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives, empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background. Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc., but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities. Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably, VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on short-form video engagement prediction.

<title>Less is More: Skim Transformer for Light Field Image Super-resolution</title>

Abstract: A light field image captures scenes through an array of micro-lenses, providing a rich representation that encompasses spatial and angular information. While this richness comes at the cost of significant data redundancy, most existing light field methods still tend to indiscriminately utilize all the information from sub-aperture images (SAIs) in an attempt to harness every visual cue regardless of their disparity significance. However, this paradigm inevitably leads to disparity entanglement, a fundamental cause of inefficiency in light field image processing. To address this limitation, we introduce the Skim Transformer, a novel architecture inspired by the ``less is more" philosophy. Unlike conventional light field Transformers, our Skim Transformer features a multi-branch structure where each branch is dedicated to a specific disparity range by constructing its attention score matrix over a skimmed subset of SAIs, rather than all of them. Building upon this core component, we present SkimLFSR, an efficient yet powerful network for light field super-resolution (LFSR). Requiring only 67\% of parameters, SkimLFSR achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing the best existing method by an average of 0.59 dB and 0.35 dB in PSNR at the 2x and 4x tasks, respectively. Through in-depth analyses, we reveal that SkimLFSR, guided by the predefined skimmed SAI sets as prior knowledge, demonstrates distinct disparity-aware behaviors in attending to visual cues. These findings highlight its effectiveness and adaptability as a promising paradigm for light field image processing.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel model inspired by CycleGAN: FQGA-single to produce high quality medical synthetic CT (sCT) generated images more efficiently. Evaluations were done on the SynthRAD Grand Challenge dataset with the CycleGAN model used for benchmarking and for comparing the quality of CBCT-to-sCT generated images from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. Finally, this paper also explores ideas from the paper "One Epoch Is All You Need" to compare models trained on a single epoch versus multiple epochs. Astonishing results from FQGA-single were obtained during this exploratory experiment, which show that the performance of FQGA-single when trained on a single epoch surpasses itself when trained on multiple epochs. More surprising is that its performance also surpasses CycleGAN's multiple-epoch and single-epoch models, and even a modified version of CycleGAN.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze a nonlinear elasticity model introduced by the authors for comparing two images, regarded as bounded open subsets of $\R^n$ together with associated vector-valued intensity maps. Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural coercivity and polyconvexity conditions, assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable. Variants of the existence theorem are also proved, first under the constraint that finite sets of landmark points in the two images are mapped one to the other, and second when one image is to be compared to an unknown part of another.
  The question is studied as to whether for images related by an affine mapping the unique minimiser is given by that affine mapping. For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of affinely related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone. This suggests a new model in which the integrand depends also on second derivatives of the transformation, and an example is given for which both existence of minimisers is assured and the above property holds for all pairs of affinely related images.

Abstract: Enhancing low-light images remains a critical challenge in computer vision, as does designing lightweight models for edge devices that can handle the computational demands of deep learning. This article introduces an extended version of the Channel-Prior and Gamma-Estimation Network (CPGA-Net), termed CPGA-Net+, incorporating the theoretically-based Attentions for illumination in local and global processing. Additionally, we assess our approach through a theoretical analysis of the block design by introducing both an ultra-lightweight and a stronger version, following the same design principles. The lightweight version significantly reduces computational costs by over two-thirds by utilizing the local branch as an auxiliary component. Meanwhile, the stronger version achieves an impressive balance by maximizing local and global processing capabilities. Our proposed methods have been validated as effective compared to recent lightweight approaches, offering superior performance and scalable solutions with limited computational resources.

<title>A Plug-and-Play Method for Guided Multi-contrast MRI Reconstruction based on Content/Style Modeling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13477</link>

arXiv:2409.13477v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since multiple MRI contrasts of the same anatomy contain redundant information, one contrast can guide the reconstruction of an undersampled subsequent contrast. To this end, several end-to-end learning-based guided reconstruction methods have been proposed. However, a key challenge is the requirement of large paired training datasets comprising raw data and aligned reference images. We propose a modular two-stage approach addressing this issue, additionally providing an explanatory framework for the multi-contrast problem based on the shared and non-shared generative factors underlying two given contrasts. A content/style model of two-contrast image data is learned from a largely unpaired image-domain dataset and is subsequently applied as a plug-and-play operator in iterative reconstruction. The disentanglement of content and style allows explicit representation of contrast-independent and contrast-specific factors. Consequently, incorporating prior information into the reconstruction reduces to a simple replacement of the aliased content of the reconstruction iterate with high-quality content derived from the reference scan. Combining this component with a data consistency step and introducing a general corrective process for the content yields an iterative scheme. We name this novel approach PnP-CoSMo. Various aspects like interpretability and convergence are explored via simulations. Furthermore, its practicality is demonstrated on the public NYU fastMRI DICOM dataset, showing improved generalizability compared to end-to-end methods, and on two in-house multi-coil raw datasets, offering up to 32.6% more acceleration over learning-based non-guided reconstruction for a given SSIM.

<title>EfficientEQA: An Efficient Approach to Open-Vocabulary Embodied Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is an essential yet challenging task for robot assistants. Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for EQA, but existing approaches either treat it as static video question answering without active exploration or restrict answers to a closed set of choices. These limitations hinder real-world applicability, where a robot must explore efficiently and provide accurate answers in open-vocabulary settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EfficientEQA, a novel framework that couples efficient exploration with free-form answer generation. EfficientEQA features three key innovations: (1) Semantic-Value-Weighted Frontier Exploration (SFE) with Verbalized Confidence (VC) from a black-box VLM to prioritize semantically important areas to explore, enabling the agent to gather relevant information faster; (2) a BLIP relevancy-based mechanism to stop adaptively by flagging highly relevant observations as outliers to indicate whether the agent has collected enough information; and (3) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method for the VLM to answer accurately based on pertinent images from the agent's observation history without relying on predefined choices. Our experimental results show that EfficientEQA achieves over 15% higher answer accuracy and requires over 20% fewer exploration steps than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In robotic visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based models have achieved significant success in improving the accuracy of action trajectory generation compared to traditional autoregressive models. However, they suffer from inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps and limited flexibility from complex constraints. In this paper, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine AutoRegressive Policy (CARP), a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy learning that redefines the autoregressive action generation process as a coarse-to-fine, next-scale approach. CARP decouples action generation into two stages: first, an action autoencoder learns multi-scale representations of the entire action sequence; then, a GPT-style transformer refines the sequence prediction through a coarse-to-fine autoregressive process. This straightforward and intuitive approach produces highly accurate and smooth actions, matching or even surpassing the performance of diffusion-based policies while maintaining efficiency on par with autoregressive policies. We conduct extensive evaluations across diverse settings, including single-task and multi-task scenarios on state-based and image-based simulation benchmarks, as well as real-world tasks. CARP achieves competitive success rates, with up to a 10% improvement, and delivers 10x faster inference compared to state-of-the-art policies, establishing a high-performance, efficient, and flexible paradigm for action generation in robotic tasks.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), a central challenge is distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural ones. Despite the impressive capabilities of advanced generative models in producing visually compelling images, significant discrepancies remain when compared to natural images. To systematically investigate and quantify these differences, we construct a large-scale multimodal dataset, D-ANI, comprising 5,000 natural images and over 440,000 AIGI samples generated by nine representative models using both unimodal and multimodal prompts, including Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text-and-Image-to-Image (TI2I). We then introduce an AI-Natural Image Discrepancy assessment benchmark (D-Judge) to address the critical question: how far are AI-generated images (AIGIs) from truly realistic images? Our fine-grained evaluation framework assesses the D-ANI dataset across five dimensions: naive visual quality, semantic alignment, aesthetic appeal, downstream task applicability, and coordinated human validation. Extensive experiments reveal substantial discrepancies across these dimensions, highlighting the importance of aligning quantitative metrics with human judgment to achieve a comprehensive understanding of AI-generated image quality.

Abstract: Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform diverse tasks across varied environments is a central challenge in robot learning. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.

Abstract: Underwater simulators offer support for building robust underwater perception solutions. Significant work has recently been done to develop new simulators and to advance the performance of existing underwater simulators. Still, there remains room for improvement on physics-based underwater sensor modeling and rendering efficiency. In this paper, we propose OceanSim, a high-fidelity GPU-accelerated underwater simulator to address this research gap. We propose advanced physics-based rendering techniques to reduce the sim-to-real gap for underwater image simulation. We develop OceanSim to fully leverage the computing advantages of GPUs and achieve real-time imaging sonar rendering and fast synthetic data generation. We evaluate the capabilities and realism of OceanSim using real-world data to provide qualitative and quantitative results.

Abstract: We introduce MeshPad, a generative approach that creates 3D meshes from sketch inputs. Building on recent advances in artist-reminiscent triangle mesh generation, our approach addresses the need for interactive mesh creation. To this end, we focus on enabling consistent edits by decomposing editing into 'deletion' of regions of a mesh, followed by 'addition' of new mesh geometry. Both operations are invoked by simple user edits of a sketch image, facilitating an iterative content creation process and enabling the construction of complex 3D meshes. Our approach is based on a triangle sequence-based mesh representation, exploiting a large Transformer model for mesh triangle addition and deletion. In order to perform edits interactively, we introduce a vertex-aligned speculative prediction strategy on top of our additive mesh generator. This speculator predicts multiple output tokens corresponding to a vertex, thus significantly reducing the computational cost of inference and accelerating the editing process, making it possible to execute each editing step in only a few seconds. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MeshPad outperforms state-of-the-art sketch-conditioned mesh generation methods, achieving more than 22% mesh quality improvement in Chamfer distance, and being preferred by 90% of participants in perceptual evaluations.

<title>Robustness to Geographic Distribution Shift Using Location Encoders</title>

Abstract: Geographic distribution shift arises when the distribution of locations on Earth in a training dataset is different from what is seen at test time. The most common approaches to tackling geographic distribution shift treat regions delimited by administrative boundaries such as countries or continents as separate domains and apply standard domain adaptation methods, ignoring geographic coordinates that are often available as metadata. This paper proposes the use of location encoders for modeling continuous, learnable domain assignment. We show how both non-parametric sine-cosine encoders and pre-trained location encoders can be used in conjunction with standard domain adaptation methods for improved robustness to geographic distribution shift. Our proposed methods achieve new state-of-the-art results on two geo-tagged remote sensing datasets from the WILDS benchmark. We have made our code publicly available at: https://github.com/crastoru/wilds-geoshift.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of prenatal ultrasound (US) is essential for early detection of developmental anomalies. However, operator dependency and technical limitations (e.g. intrinsic artefacts and effects, setting errors) can complicate image interpretation and the assessment of diagnostic uncertainty. We present L-FUSION (Laplacian Fetal US Segmentation with Integrated FoundatiON models), a framework that integrates uncertainty quantification through unsupervised, normative learning and large-scale foundation models for robust segmentation of fetal structures in normal and pathological scans. We propose to utilise the aleatoric logit distributions of Stochastic Segmentation Networks and Laplace approximations with fast Hessian estimations to estimate epistemic uncertainty only from the segmentation head. This enables us to achieve reliable abnormality quantification for instant diagnostic feedback. Combined with an integrated Dropout component, L-FUSION enables reliable differentiation of lesions from normal fetal anatomy with enhanced uncertainty maps and segmentation counterfactuals in US imaging. It improves epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty interpretation and removes the need for manual disease-labelling. Evaluations across multiple datasets show that L-FUSION achieves superior segmentation accuracy and consistent uncertainty quantification, supporting on-site decision-making and offering a scalable solution for advancing fetal ultrasound analysis in clinical settings.

Abstract: Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution images under limited computational costs. We find that existing frequency-based SR methods cannot balance the reconstruction of overall structures and high-frequency parts. Meanwhile, these methods are inefficient for handling frequency features and unsuitable for lightweight SR. In this paper, we show that introducing both wavelet and Fourier information allows our model to consider both high-frequency features and overall SR structure reconstruction while reducing costs. Specifically, we propose a Dual-domain Modulation Network that integrates both wavelet and Fourier information for enhanced frequency modeling. Unlike existing methods that rely on a single frequency representation, our design combines wavelet-domain modulation via a Wavelet-domain Modulation Transformer (WMT) with global Fourier supervision, enabling complementary spectral learning well-suited for lightweight SR. Experimental results show that our method achieves a comparable PSNR to SRFormer and MambaIR while with less than 50\% and 60\% of their FLOPs and achieving inference speeds 15.4x and 5.4x faster, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method on SR quality and lightweight.

Abstract: Introducing accelerated reconstruction algorithms into clinical settings requires measures of uncertainty quantification that accurately assess the relevant uncertainty introduced by the reconstruction algorithm. Many currently deployed approaches quantifying uncertainty by focusing on measuring the variability in voxelwise intensity variation. Although these provide interpretable maps, they lack a structural interpretation and do not show a clear relationship to how the data will be analysed subsequently. In this work we show that voxel level uncertainty does not provide insight into morphological uncertainty. To do so, we use segmentation as a clinically-relevant downstream task and deploy ensembles of reconstruction modes to measure uncertainty in the reconstructions. We show that variability and bias in the morphological structures are present and within-ensemble variability cannot be predicted well with uncertainty measured only by voxel intensity variations.

Abstract: Machine learning classification models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) often inadvertently rely on spurious correlations. When absent in the test data, these unintended associations between non-target attributes and target labels lead to poor generalization. This paper addresses this problem from a model optimization perspective and proposes a novel method, Gradient Extrapolation for Debiased Representation Learning (GERNE), designed to learn debiased representations in both known and unknown attribute training cases. GERNE uses two distinct batches with different amounts of spurious correlations and defines the target gradient as a linear extrapolation of the gradients computed from each batch's loss. Our analysis shows that when the extrapolated gradient points toward the batch gradient with fewer spurious correlations, it effectively guides training toward learning a debiased model. GERNE serves as a general framework for debiasing, encompassing ERM and Resampling methods as special cases. We derive the theoretical upper and lower bounds of the extrapolation factor employed by GERNE. By tuning this factor, GERNE can adapt to maximize either Group-Balanced Accuracy (GBA) or Worst-Group Accuracy (WGA). We validate GERNE on five vision and one NLP benchmarks, demonstrating competitive and often superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Realistic simulation is critical for applications ranging from robotics to animation. Learned simulators have emerged as a possibility to capture real world physics directly from video data, but very often require privileged information such as depth information, particle tracks and hand-engineered features to maintain spatial and temporal consistency. These strong inductive biases or ground truth 3D information help in domains where data is sparse but limit scalability and generalization in data rich regimes. To overcome the key limitations, we propose 3DGSim, a learned 3D simulator that directly learns physical interactions from multi-view RGB videos. 3DGSim unifies 3D scene reconstruction, particle dynamics prediction and video synthesis into an end-to-end trained framework. It adopts MVSplat to learn a latent particle-based representation of 3D scenes, a Point Transformer for particle dynamics, a Temporal Merging module for consistent temporal aggregation and Gaussian Splatting to produce novel view renderings. By jointly training inverse rendering and dynamics forecasting, 3DGSim embeds the physical properties into point-wise latent features. This enables the model to capture diverse physical behaviors, from rigid to elastic, cloth-like dynamics, and boundary conditions (e.g. fixed cloth corner), along with realistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multibody interactions and novel scene edits.

Abstract: Precise LiDAR-camera calibration is crucial for integrating these two sensors into robotic systems to achieve robust perception. In applications like autonomous driving, online targetless calibration enables a prompt sensor misalignment correction from mechanical vibrations without extra targets. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in effectively extracting consistent features from LiDAR and camera data and fail to prioritize salient regions, compromising cross-modal alignment robustness. To address these issues, we propose DF-Calib, a LiDAR-camera calibration method that reformulates calibration as an intra-modality depth flow estimation problem. DF-Calib estimates a dense depth map from the camera image and completes the sparse LiDAR projected depth map, using a shared feature encoder to extract consistent depth-to-depth features, effectively bridging the 2D-3D cross-modal gap. Additionally, we introduce a reliability map to prioritize valid pixels and propose a perceptually weighted sparse flow loss to enhance depth flow estimation. Experimental results across multiple datasets validate its accuracy and generalization,with DF-Calib achieving a mean translation error of 0.635cm and rotation error of 0.045 degrees on the KITTI dataset.

Abstract: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) poses significant diagnostic challenges, hindering timely intervention. Current screening methodologies lack standardization, and AI-driven studies suffer from reproducibility issues due to limited data and code availability. To address these limitations, we introduce Retuve, an open-source framework for multi-modality DDH analysis, encompassing both ultrasound (US) and X-ray imaging. Retuve provides a complete and reproducible workflow, offering open datasets comprising expert-annotated US and X-ray images, pre-trained models with training code and weights, and a user-friendly Python Application Programming Interface (API). The framework integrates segmentation and landmark detection models, enabling automated measurement of key diagnostic parameters such as the alpha angle and acetabular index. By adhering to open-source principles, Retuve promotes transparency, collaboration, and accessibility in DDH research. This initiative has the potential to democratize DDH screening, facilitate early diagnosis, and ultimately improve patient outcomes by enabling widespread screening and early intervention.

Abstract: We present SOPHY, a generative model for 3D physics-aware shape synthesis. Unlike existing 3D generative models that focus solely on static geometry or 4D models that produce physics-agnostic animations, our method jointly synthesizes shape, texture, and material properties related to physics-grounded dynamics, making the generated objects ready for simulations and interactive, dynamic environments. To train our model, we introduce a dataset of 3D objects annotated with detailed physical material attributes, along with an efficient pipeline for material annotation. Our method enables applications such as text-driven generation of interactive, physics-aware 3D objects and single-image reconstruction of physically plausible shapes. Furthermore, our experiments show that jointly modeling shape and material properties enhances the realism and fidelity of the generated shapes, improving performance on both generative geometry and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.

Abstract: This paper evaluates single-view mesh reconstruction models for their potential in enabling instant digital twin creation for real-time planning and dynamics prediction using physics simulators for robotic manipulation. Recent single-view 3D reconstruction advances offer a promising avenue toward an automated real-to-sim pipeline: directly mapping a single observation of a scene into a simulation instance by reconstructing scene objects as individual, complete, and physically plausible 3D meshes. However, their suitability for physics simulations and robotics applications under immediacy, physical fidelity, and simulation readiness remains underexplored. We establish robotics-specific benchmarking criteria for 3D reconstruction, including handling typical inputs, collision-free and stable geometry, occlusions robustness, and meeting computational constraints. Our empirical evaluation using realistic robotics datasets shows that despite success on computer vision benchmarks, existing approaches fail to meet robotics-specific requirements. We quantitively examine limitations of single-view reconstruction for practical robotics implementation, in contrast to prior work that focuses on multi-view approaches. Our findings highlight critical gaps between computer vision advances and robotics needs, guiding future research at this intersection.

Abstract: Image deblurring plays a crucial role in enhancing visual clarity across various applications. Although most deep learning approaches primarily focus on sRGB images, which inherently lose critical information during the image signal processing pipeline, RAW images, being unprocessed and linear, possess superior restoration potential but remain underexplored. Deblurring RAW images presents unique challenges, particularly in handling frequency-dependent blur while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Frequency Enhanced Network (FrENet), a framework specifically designed for RAW-to-RAW deblurring that operates directly in the frequency domain. We introduce a novel Adaptive Frequency Positional Modulation module, which dynamically adjusts frequency components according to their spectral positions, thereby enabling precise control over the deblurring process. Additionally, frequency domain skip connections are adopted to further preserve high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate that FrENet surpasses state-of-the-art deblurring methods in RAW image deblurring, achieving significantly better restoration quality while maintaining high efficiency in terms of reduced MACs. Furthermore, FrENet's adaptability enables it to be extended to sRGB images, where it delivers comparable or superior performance compared to methods specifically designed for sRGB data. The code will be available at https://github.com/WenlongJiao/FrENet .

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing modality reconstruction remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we identify and formalize three potential paradigms for missing modality reconstruction, and perform a comprehensive evaluation across these paradigms, covering 42 model variants in terms of reconstruction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i) fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and, at times, misaligned generations. To address these challenges, we propose an agentic framework tailored for missing modality reconstruction. This framework dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic features. In addition, we introduce a self-refinement mechanism, which iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for missing image reconstruction by at least 14\% and MER for missing text reconstruction by at least 10\% compared to baselines. Code are released at: https://github.com/Guanzhou-Ke/AFM2.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision space.

Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.

<title>Speckle2Self: Self-Supervised Ultrasound Speckle Reduction Without Clean Data</title>

arXiv:2507.06828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead, US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales, while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness, Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and adaptability to images from unseen domains. Project page: https://noseefood.github.io/us-speckle2self/

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial. Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM, MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure accuracy. We also publicly release our code at \href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.

Abstract: Surface defect detection of steel, especially the recognition of multi-scale defects, has always been a major challenge in industrial manufacturing. Steel surfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the accuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex environments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of insufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small target defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection framework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the C3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve detection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to reduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing the spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to enhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant computations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally, the CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps in a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures detailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher accuracy and robustness in steel surface defect detection tasks compared to other methods, effectively addressing defect detection problems.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE for enhancing GUI agents at both training and inference. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a continuous reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a ``Simple Thinking'' reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a cropping-based resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present decomposed grounding with selection to dramatically improve grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art grounding performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 while it also exhibits strong general agent capabilities. For instance, using both our training and inference enhancement methods brings 23\% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro. We provide the code in https://github.com/KDEGroup/UI-AGILE.

<div> Keywords: Learned image compression, Mamba-style state-space models, Content-Adaptive Mamba, global dependencies, rate-distortion performance <br />
Summary: 
Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM) improves on traditional Mamba models by incorporating content-aware token reorganization and a prompt dictionary to better capture global dependencies. CAM prioritizes proximity in feature space over Euclidean space, allowing for more dynamic content exploitation. By integrating global priors, CAM mitigates issues with strict causality and long-range decay in token interactions. Leveraging CAM, the Content-Adaptive Mamba-based Learned image compression (CMIC) model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, outperforming VTM-21.0 on Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks by significant margins of -15.91%, -21.34%, and -17.58% BD-rate respectively. This innovation demonstrates the potential for improved image compression techniques through dynamic state-space models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However, vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Summary:  
Residual Perturbation Attack (ResPA) is introduced as a novel method for crafting adversarial examples with high transferability in deep neural networks. Unlike existing techniques, ResPA uses the residual gradient as the perturbation direction to guide the generation of adversarial examples towards flat regions of the loss function. By incorporating an exponential moving average on input gradients to capture historical information, ResPA considers both local flatness and global perturbation directions, leading to improved transferability compared to traditional transfer-based attack methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ResPA, especially when combined with input transformation techniques, in generating adversarial examples that transfer well across models. The code for ResPA is also made available for further research and experimentation.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function. Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current input transformation methods. The code is available at https://github.com/ZezeTao/ResPA.

Summary: 
Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for practical machine learning deployment. Existing methods often lack generalization capability, leading to inconsistent performance. To address this, the Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework introduces a General Knowledge Model (GKM) to enhance the model's general knowledge. The Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) theory helps reduce generalization error by incorporating a general knowledge model. The Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE) mechanism adapts the guidance of general knowledge based on the GKM's Generalized Belief (G-Belief), improving the GS-balance. Experimental results on OOD benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The codes will be made available for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model (GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE) mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM, thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image diffusion models, machine unlearning, Low-Rank Adaptation, UnGuide, Classifier-Free Guidance

Summary: 
UnGuide introduces a novel approach to addressing the potential misuse of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models by enabling targeted unlearning of specific knowledge or concepts. This is achieved through a dynamic inference mechanism called UnGuidance, which leverages Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. By modulating the guidance scale based on the denoising process's stability, UnGuide allows for selective unlearning by the LoRA adapter while maintaining image fidelity and realism. The approach outperforms existing LoRA-based methods in tasks such as object erasure and explicit content removal, demonstrating controlled concept removal and retaining the expressive power of diffusion models. <div>
arXiv:2508.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

<div> Keywords: artistic style transfer, partial convolution, neural networks, region of interest, SA-1B dataset

Summary:
This paper introduces a new approach to artistic style transfer that focuses on applying style features exclusively to specific regions of interest within an image. Unlike traditional methods that apply style transfer to the entire image and then mask it, the proposed partial-convolution-based network accurately captures style features in the desired regions. The network also incorporates internal blending techniques to address any imperfections in the region selection process. By enhancing stylization outcomes through targeted application of style features, the proposed method offers visual and quantitative improvements, as demonstrated using examples from the SA-1B dataset. The code for this approach is publicly available for further exploration and implementation. This novel technique opens up opportunities for more precise and visually appealing artistic style transfers tailored to specific regions of interest within images. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest. Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

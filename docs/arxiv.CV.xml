<div> Keywords: video analytics, natural language queries, machine learning, object detection, benchmarking<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a language-driven video analytics system, called Lava, designed to handle large amounts of urban camera network footage through natural language queries. Lava utilizes a multi-armed bandit-based sampling method for video localization, an open-world detection module for object retrieval, and a trajectory extraction scheme for object association. The system improves query accuracy, reduces processing time, and achieves high precision in object retrieval tasks. The authors also provide a benchmark dataset with diverse natural language predicates and annotations for evaluation. Experimental results show significant improvements in query performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods. The code and dataset are available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories, significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language. Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval; and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that \textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$, reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$ precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $ faster than the most accurate baseline. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/yuyanrui/LAVA.

<div> Keywords: augmented reality, visual information manipulation attacks, taxonomy, dataset, multimodal semantic reasoning 

Summary: 
Visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in augmented reality (AR) can distort the meaning of real-world scenes, causing semantic misunderstandings and user errors. This work introduces a taxonomy categorizing VIM attacks into character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, with purposes including information replacement and obfuscation. A dataset, AR-VIM, consisting of 452 AR video pairs, is created to simulate real-world scenarios for attack detection. A multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense, using vision-language models and optical character recognition, achieves an 88.94% attack detection accuracy on AR-VIM. The system detects attacks with an average latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds on a mobile Android AR application in a real-world evaluation. VIM-Sense outperforms vision-only and text-only baselines, offering effective protection against VIM attacks in AR environments.

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR, where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes: information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information. Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM, which consists of 452 raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world AR scenario. To detect the attacks in the dataset, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only and text-only baselines. The system achieves an average attack detection latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

<div> Keywords: 4D spatial intelligence, scene reconstruction, deep learning architectures, hierarchical structure, interaction modeling

Summary:<br /><br />Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has become a challenging yet crucial task in computer vision. This paper introduces a new perspective that categorizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence. These levels include reconstructing low-level 3D attributes, scene components, dynamic scenes, modeling interactions, and incorporating physical laws. The survey addresses the gaps in previous research and highlights key challenges at each level. By organizing methods based on their hierarchical structure, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of 4D scene reconstruction. Moving forward, the study suggests promising directions for advancing towards richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence. Ongoing developments in the field can be tracked through the project page maintained by the authors. <div>

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

Summary:
Deepfakes generated by advanced machine learning models pose a significant threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital media. Despite the development of detectors, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains uncertain. This study evaluates modern deepfake detectors using a novel testing procedure on a dataset containing over 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. The analysis reveals that detecting deepfakes is still a challenging task, with less than half of the detectors achieving an AUC score above 60%. Basic image manipulations like JPEG compression can impair model performance significantly. The findings underscore the importance of ongoing research and development in deepfake detection technology to combat the growing threat of deceptive media. The code and data are available on GitHub for further exploration and development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem, their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly reduce model performance.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods, such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central, tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p < 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species management and improved environmental outcomes.

Summary:
HoneyImage is proposed for dataset ownership verification in image recognition models. It selectively modifies hard samples to embed imperceptible traces, enabling reliable verification while preserving data integrity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and model architectures validate HoneyImage's effectiveness in achieving strong verification accuracy with minimal impact on performance. The method enhances data owners' ability to protect proprietary image datasets, fostering safe sharing and unlocking data-driven AI's transformative potential. <div>
arXiv:2508.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However, many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks, particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision, enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

<div> Keywords: event-based perception, self-supervised learning, spatio-temporal information, recurrent models, long-term history

Summary: 
TESPEC introduces a self-supervised pre-training framework focused on learning spatio-temporal information for event-based perception tasks. Unlike existing methods, TESPEC leverages long event sequences during pre-training, allowing recurrent models to excel. By accumulating events into pseudo grayscale videos that capture high-level semantic information, TESPEC enables models to reason about the long-term history of events, improving robustness to sensor noise and motion blur. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in downstream tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. TESPEC's innovative approach offers state-of-the-art results by enhancing the temporal understanding of event data and showcasing the importance of incorporating long-term temporal information for improved event-based perception tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks, as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts. Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically aligned attention patterns.

This study focused on transferring a labeling approach from treadmill running to ergometer cycling using a combination of automatic and manual data annotation. The researchers found that fine-tuning a deep neural network with a small amount of manually annotated data significantly improved its performance. By combining automatically generated labels with limited manual data, the adaptation of deep neural networks to new scenarios like the transition from treadmill to bicycle was accelerated. This approach demonstrates the efficacy of leveraging both automatic and manual data annotation for improving the performance of semantic segmentation networks in sports medicine applications.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine, allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity, and aesthetic quality.

Summary: 
The paper introduces AutoSIGHT, a system that automatically assesses human expertise in visual tasks using eye tracking data. It classifies performers as expert or non-expert based on features extracted during task-solving. Results show AutoSIGHT achieves an average AUROC of 0.751 in a subject-disjoint train-test regime with a 5-second evaluation window, indicating effective detection. With a 30-second window, the AUROC increases to 0.8306, leveraging more information at the cost of delayed decisions. This work suggests new research directions on incorporating human and machine expertise in human-AI partnerships that adapt to changing expertise distribution. The eye tracking data from 6 experts and 53 non-experts solving iris PAD tasks is also provided.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT, Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds, AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of 0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts solving iris PAD visual task.

<div> Keywords: 3D reconstruction, incremental Structure from Motion, geometric estimation, bundle adjustment, reprojection error

Summary:
Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is essential for various applications. Global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques are precise but can be sensitive to noise and missing data. Incremental SfM, on the other hand, allows for flexible reconstruction by gradually incorporating new views. This method can recover scene structure and camera motion in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. The paper provides a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing on geometric estimation consistency and the iterative refinement through bundle adjustment. By applying this approach to a real dataset, the study evaluates reconstruction quality based on reprojection error and camera trajectory coherence. The results demonstrate the practical utility of incremental SfM as a reliable method for achieving sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured environments.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding. While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper, we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured environments.

Summary: 
This study addresses the need for automated methods to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload due to a rising number of CT scans. The proposed graph-based approach models CT scans as structured graphs and leverages spectral domain convolution on axial slice triplets nodes to enhance multi-label anomaly classification. The method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, competitive performance, and robustness to z-axis translation. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional networks struggle with modeling long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers are computationally expensive and require extensive pre-training. The new approach demonstrates improved performance in multi-label classification of 3D CT scans by effectively capturing complex spatial relationships within volumetric data. Additionally, an ablation study evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload. Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs, leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

<div> Keywords: Dataset Ownership Verification, Copyright Detection, Evasion Attacks, Vision-Language Models, Large Language Models

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to evade Dataset Ownership Verification (DOV) methods, focusing on protecting copyright in deep model training. The proposed framework involves transferring task-relevant domain knowledge from a teacher model to a student model using an out-of-distribution dataset as an intermediary. By selectively transferring knowledge, the approach achieves a balance between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and effectiveness while eliminating all copyright identifiers. The study also exposes vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, emphasizing the importance of ongoing development to enhance practicality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification (DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for long-term development to enhance practicality.

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual (image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

arXiv:2508.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems. Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis, detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO, iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition capabilities.

Summary: 
AURA is a hybrid spatiotemporal-chromatic framework aimed at detecting and classifying industrial smoke emissions in real-time. Current monitoring systems often struggle to differentiate smoke types and handle environmental variability, which AURA addresses by leveraging dynamic movement patterns and color characteristics of industrial smoke. By doing so, it enhances accuracy and reduces false positives, ultimately improving environmental compliance, operational safety, and public health outcomes through precise automated monitoring of industrial emissions. This novel framework has the potential to revolutionize the monitoring of industrial emissions by providing a more specific and reliable approach to detecting and classifying smoke emissions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Summary:
Trans-Adapter is introduced as a solution for processing RGBA images directly using diffusion-based inpainting models, allowing for better preservation of transparency consistency in edited regions. It also supports controllable editing through ControlNet integration and can be easily integrated into various existing models. LayerBench, a new evaluation benchmark, is introduced along with a novel metric for assessing transparency edge quality. The method addresses challenges faced by conventional transparent image inpainting methods by offering a more seamless and efficient workflow. Experimental results on LayerBench showcase the effectiveness of Trans-Adapter in handling transparent images and ensuring high-quality transparency edge preservation. <div>
arXiv:2508.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench, along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Summary: 
MASIV is a novel vision-based framework for system identification from videos that does not rely on predefined material priors. It utilizes learnable neural constitutive models to infer object dynamics without assuming specific material properties, allowing for more flexibility in handling unknown materials. MASIV addresses the challenge of incomplete particle state information by incorporating dense geometric guidance through reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, which provides richer motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability, indicating its effectiveness in recovering object geometry and physical laws from videos. <div>
arXiv:2508.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Summary: <br />
The study investigates three strategies - supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning - to enhance performance on image editing tasks using an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens together.

This led to the development of EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a robust RL-based image editing model that achieves competitive results across various editing tasks with minimal training data. The released EARL model marks a significant advancement in autoregressive multimodal models for image editing tasks. The code, training data, and trained models for EARL are available at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL. <div>

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL.

The paper introduces two novel tasks, Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, which utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without explicit 3D scenes. UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model, is proposed for egocentric devices and supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation. The model extracts image-based scene context to infer plausible 3D motion and achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction. The framework is the first to generate motion from a single egocentric image. A large-scale dataset, EE4D-Motion, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth 3D motion annotations is introduced to facilitate training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications. <div>

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction, advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective. However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth 3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

arXiv:2508.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and 578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing (unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization, skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7% (image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset, indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its potential for real-world clinical applications.

<div> Colorfulness, Dataset Condensation, Image Selection, Semantic Distortion, Representation Learning 

Summary: 
The article introduces DC3, a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation that aims to address the trade-off between performance and fidelity when compressing datasets. Existing methods either struggle with inefficiency in selection or introduce semantic distortion. DC3 focuses on enhancing the color diversity of condensed images to improve representation learning. Through a calibrated selection strategy and the use of a latent diffusion model, DC3 outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks. Additionally, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. Experimental results show superior performance and generalization, with FID results indicating the feasibility of training networks with high-quality datasets generated by DC3 without degradation issues. Code and data generated by DC3 will be released soon.

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding. OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement 17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-image diffusion models, safety mechanisms, personalized user profiles, Sage dataset, harmful content suppression

Summary:
Text-to-image diffusion models have transformed visual content generation, but current safety measures do not consider individual user preferences. The proposed Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA) framework addresses this gap by allowing users to control safety behaviors in generative models based on their preferences. By integrating personalized user profiles into the diffusion process and utilizing the Sage dataset, PSA adjusts the model's behavior to align with individual safety preferences while maintaining image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PSA performs better in suppressing harmful content and aligning generated content with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. The code, data, and models for PSA are publicly available at https://torpedo2648.github.io/PSAlign/.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process, adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://torpedo2648.github.io/PSAlign/.

<div> Keywords: LawDIS, dichotomous image segmentation, language-controlled segmentation, window-controlled refinement, latent diffusion model 

Summary: 
LawDIS is a new framework for image segmentation that combines language and window-based controls to produce high-quality object masks. It uses a latent diffusion model to integrate user controls seamlessly, offering macro and micro control modes. In macro mode, a language-controlled segmentation strategy generates an initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a window-controlled refinement strategy allows flexible adjustments within the initial mask. The framework can operate independently or together, making it suitable for personalized applications. Experimental results on the DIS5K benchmark show that LawDIS outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains in accuracy. The framework significantly outperforms the second-best model, MVANet, across all metrics on DIS-TE. The code for LawDIS will be available on GitHub at https://github.com/XinyuYanTJU/LawDIS.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask. Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics. Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$ gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at https://github.com/XinyuYanTJU/LawDIS.

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general applicability.

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Summary: <br />
SPFSplat is a framework for efficient 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images that does not require ground-truth poses during training or inference. It simultaneously predicts 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space in a single feed-forward step. The framework includes a rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses and a reprojection loss to improve geometric constraints. Despite lacking pose supervision, SPFSplat performs exceptionally well in novel view synthesis, especially under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap. It also outperforms recent methods in relative pose estimation that use geometry priors. The pose-free training approach and efficient design make SPFSplat suitable for practical applications.  <br /> <div>

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step. Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap. It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page: https://ranrhuang.github.io/spfsplat/.

<div> Keywords: Embodied AI, object manipulation, 3D affordance grounding, affordance classification, multi-scale feature propagation

Summary:
Embodied AI faces the challenge of learning object manipulation from observation like humans. Prior methods often separate the tasks of localizing 3D object affordance areas and understanding their functionalities, leading to inconsistent predictions. These methods also tend to only ground incomplete affordance areas depicted in images and operate at a fixed scale, making it difficult to handle varying affordance scales. To address these issues, a novel approach is proposed that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy that considers the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. By developing a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale feature propagation, the method can infer full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. A two-stage prediction mechanism is also adopted to improve affordance understanding. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both affordance grounding and classification. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.

Summary:<br />
Visual grounding is crucial for spatial perception in autonomous driving, but current methods relying on bounding boxes often lack fine-grained detail. To address this, a new benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in outdoor scenes has been introduced, using natural language and voxel-level occupancy annotations for more precise object representation. The GroundingOcc model, designed for this task, combines visual, textual, and point cloud features for accurate object location and occupancy prediction. The model includes a multimodal encoder, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head for location refinement. Additional modules for 2D grounding and depth estimation enhance geometric understanding, resulting in improved performance compared to existing baselines. The dataset and model code are available for further research and development. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task. Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual, and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Summary:
RoadMamba, a novel approach for road surface classification, combines local and global perception using the Mamba architecture. By utilizing the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM), RoadMamba effectively extracts both global semantics and local texture of road surfaces. The Dual Attention Fusion (DAF) decodes and fuses these dual features, enhancing classification accuracy. The addition of a dual auxiliary loss further ensures that the network does not solely rely on global semantic information but also considers the local texture. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that RoadMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods. This innovative approach holds promise for enhancing the planning and control systems of autonomous vehicles, ultimately improving safety and driving comfort on the road.

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies provides effective information for the planning and control system of autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba. Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture. The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million samples.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion models, Style transfer, Prior-Guided Data Distillation, Contrastive Semantic Decoupling, Semantic preservation

Summary: 
StyDeco introduces a new framework for style transfer in images by addressing the limitations of existing text-driven diffusion models. The framework utilizes Prior-Guided Data Distillation to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision, generating pseudo-paired data for training. Contrastive Semantic Decoupling is then applied to adapt a text encoder using domain-specific weights, encouraging distinct semantic clusters for source and target representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that StyDeco outperforms existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity and structural preservation. The framework also supports a unique de-stylization process, showcasing its versatility. The code for StyDeco is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer, but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper, we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling (CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters. Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

<div> Keywords: floorplan localization, visual context, unsupervised learning, scene layout priors, room discriminator<br />
Summary:<br />
- Visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) is crucial for understanding building layouts but can be challenging due to repetitive structures in floorplans leading to ambiguous localization.
- Existing methods rely on matching 2D structural cues or 3D geometry-constrained pre-trainings, ignoring richer contextual information provided by visual images.
- The proposed approach utilizes broader visual scene context and an unsupervised learning technique with clustering constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on unlabeled room images.
- The room discriminator extracts hidden room types and guides FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to improve localization accuracy.
- Comparative studies on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty. In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process, relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world settings.

<div> Deep Neural Networks, Eigen Neural Network, image classification, feature representations, cross-modal retrieval

Summary:
The article introduces the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture designed to address the inherent disordered weight structures in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that can degrade learning dynamics. By reparameterizing weights in a layer-shared, learned eigenbasis, ENN enforces decorrelated and well-aligned weight dynamics, leading to more structured and discriminative feature representations. Integrated with standard backpropagation, ENN surpasses state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image classification benchmarks like ImageNet and sets a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. The article also introduces ENN-ℓ, a backpropagation-free local learning variant that achieves over 2x training speedup via parallelism and outperforms end-to-end backpropagation in accuracy. Overall, ENN presents a new architectural paradigm that directly addresses representational deficiencies in DNNs, leading to enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training regime.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP, ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient, backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training regime.

<div> Keywords: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks, ParaRevSNN, memory-efficient training, parallel architecture, resource-constrained scenarios

Summary: 
ParaRevSNN is a new architecture designed to address the high latency issue in Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) by introducing parallelism. By decoupling sequential dependencies between reversible blocks, ParaRevSNN allows for inter-block parallelism while maintaining reversibility. This design significantly accelerates both training and inference processes while still preserving the memory-saving benefits of RevSNNs. Experimental results show that ParaRevSNN achieves equal or better accuracy compared to standard RevSNNs on datasets like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture. Moreover, ParaRevSNN reduces training time by up to 35.2% and inference time to 18.15%, making it ideal for deployment in scenarios with limited resources. The parallel architecture of ParaRevSNN provides a promising approach for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of reversible spiking neural networks.

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to 18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Summary: 
- Test-time adaptation (TTA) in a zero-shot setting aims to improve model performance on unknown test distributions by utilizing unlabeled data. 
- Existing methods for cache-enhanced TTA may not ensure compact intra-class distributions due to reliance on low-entropy samples for prototype construction. 
- A positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness was identified, leading to the proposal of MCP, which utilizes three caches for prototype initialization, information integration, and prediction calibration. 
- The MCP++ framework further enhances performance by incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning. 
- Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new multi-view open-set learning framework that addresses the limitations of existing models in handling open-set scenarios. By incorporating ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing, the proposed framework aims to improve recognition of unknown categories while maintaining strong closed-set performance. A novel synthesis strategy called O-Mix is designed to generate virtual samples with calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty, which are then processed by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network to capture atypical patterns. Additionally, an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module is integrated to encourage the model to learn generalizable features by enforcing independence between view-specific ambiguous and view-consistent representations. Experimental results on various multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing unknown-class recognition and mitigating static view-induced biases. <div>
arXiv:2508.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples, we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges posed by the high computational cost of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) due to the extensive visual sequence of input tokens. Existing methods for reducing this cost often result in performance degradation due to loss of visual information. To address this issue, the paper proposes an Adaptive Content Compensation Method (ACCM) that leverages image captions to mitigate information loss. The ACCM consists of a lightweight caption model and a selector that generates question-related descriptions and selects appropriate captions, respectively. These modules are trained using self-supervised learning without the need for human or automated labeling. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ACCM outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 20.6% with 6.5% fewer FLOPs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method (ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates. Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6% with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework, OCSplats, for anti-noise 3D reconstruction, addressing challenges such as label noise in real-world scenarios. OCSplats leverages technologies like hybrid noise assessment and cognitive correction to improve noise classification accuracy in areas with cognitive differences. It also incorporates a label noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points to handle varying noise proportions in different scenarios without parameter adjustments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of OCSplats, showing superior reconstruction performance and precise label noise classification across scenes of different complexity levels.

arXiv:2508.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

NS-Net is a novel detection framework that addresses limitations in existing detectors by leveraging CLIP features for AI-generated image detection. It uses NULL-Space projection to separate semantic information from visual features, and contrastive learning to capture distributional differences between real and generated images. A Patch Selection strategy is employed to preserve fine-grained artifacts and mitigate semantic bias from global image structures. Experimental results on 40 generative models demonstrate NS-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in detection accuracy and strong generalization across GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.

arXiv:2508.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net, a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy, thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.

<div> Keywords: Face parsing, Weakly supervised learning, Representation disentanglement, Co-occurring components, Natural language descriptions

Summary: 
Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components using only weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions. The new task setting of Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP) faces challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual similarity of facial components resulting in ambiguous activations and degraded parsing performance. To address this, DisFaceRep, a representation disentanglement framework, is proposed. DisFaceRep employs both explicit and implicit mechanisms to separate co-occurring facial components. It introduces a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to reduce dataset-level bias explicitly and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DisFaceRep in outperforming existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. Find the code at: <a href="https://github.com/CVI-SZU/DisFaceRep">https://github.com/CVI-SZU/DisFaceRep</a>.

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes, lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions. WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new framework for efficient image clustering by enhancing large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP. The framework addresses the mismatch between task-agnostic representations and specific clustering tasks. It consists of two stages - Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Self-Enhancement. The first stage focuses on aligning lightweight clustering heads with the model's semantics through mining consistency between image-text pairs. A novel method for generating high-quality cluster centers and a dynamic balancing regularizer are also introduced. In the second stage, a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy using self-generated supervisory signals from the aligned model is employed to optimize the vision encoder and clustering heads. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing deep clustering methods, with the ViT-B/32 model achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods based on larger models like ViT-L/14. <div>
arXiv:2508.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement. In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads, unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger ViT-L/14.

Summary: 
- The article presents a novel SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) to improve video depth super-resolution.
- STDNet comprises two branches: a spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch.
- The spatial difference branch mitigates long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions by aligning RGB features with spatial difference representations for depth calibration.
- The temporal difference branch propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas.
- Extensive experimental results demonstrate that STDNet outperforms existing approaches in terms of reconstruction quality and performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

Summary:
Dataset distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets efficiently. Integration of diffusion generative models helps in this process but can suffer from lack of diversity in sampled images. The proposed Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS) approach tackles this issue by partitioning the distilled dataset into multiple curricula. ACS uses an adversarial loss to guide the diffusion sampling process, creating a more diverse distilled dataset and reducing information redundancy. The curriculum sampling progresses from simpler to more complex images, ensuring systematic coverage of target data spectrum. Experiments show that ACS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements on Imagewoof and ImageNet-1k datasets.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

While all models experience degradation with increased noise, Point Transformer v3 stands out for its superior calibration, displaying predicted uncertainties that align closely with the actual measurement uncertainty.

Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy, calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement uncertainty.

<div> Zero-shot video captioning, Semantic Group Captioning, Semantic Group Decoding, Key Sentences Selection, Probability Sampling Supervision 

Summary:
Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap) is proposed for zero-shot video captioning, addressing the limitations of existing methods that neglect temporal dynamics and lack video-level supervision. The method incorporates Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) to utilize multi-frame information and model inter-frame temporal relationships. Additionally, Key Sentences Selection (KSS) and Probability Sampling Supervision (PSS) modules are introduced to construct diverse sentence groups and capture inter-sentence causal relationships, enhancing generalization to video captioning. Experimental results show SGCap outperforms previous zero-shot alternatives and competes with fully supervised methods. By leveraging these components, SGCap achieves significant improvements in zero-shot video captioning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored. Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships. Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision (PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones.

<title>PromptSafe: Gated Prompt Tuning for Safe Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality, but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%), while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

<title>Integrating Disparity Confidence Estimation into Relative Depth Prior-Guided Unsupervised Stereo Matching</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks. However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically, the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence. Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

<title>GMAT: Grounded Multi-Agent Clinical Description Generation for Text Encoder in Vision-Language MIL for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>

arXiv:2508.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space (mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics. Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization performance of existing SM networks.

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module, to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor (KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder. Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers previous category information and returns category-adaptive representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of 66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD, respectively.

Abstract: We present a novel algebraic solution to the Perspective-Three-Point (P3P) problem, which aims to recover the absolute pose of a calibrated camera from three 2D-3D correspondences. Our method reformulates the problem into a quartic polynomial with coefficients that are analytically simple and computationally efficient. Despite its simplicity, the proposed solver achieves accuracy and runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets validate its robustness and efficiency. This combination of simplicity and performance makes our solver appealing for both real-time systems and educational contexts, where interpretability and reliability are critical.

<title>Multimodal Attention-Aware Fusion for Diagnosing Distal Myopathy: Evaluating Model Interpretability and Clinician Trust</title>

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1) functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world diagnostic settings.

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction. In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics, achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory speed.

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors, suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through online platforms.

<title>Weakly-Supervised Image Forgery Localization via Vision-Language Collaborative Reasoning Framework</title>

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL) has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper, we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations. Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads, where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both detection and localization accuracy.

Abstract: With increasing demand for ride comfort in new energy vehicles, accurate real-time detection of speed bumps and potholes is critical for predictive suspension control. This paper proposes SBP-YOLO, a lightweight detection framework based on YOLOv11, optimized for embedded deployment. The model integrates GhostConv for efficient computation, VoVGSCSPC for multi-scale feature enhancement, and a Lightweight Efficiency Detection Head (LEDH) to reduce early-stage feature processing costs. A hybrid training strategy combining NWD loss, knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based weather augmentation improves detection robustness, especially for small and distant targets. Experiments show SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP (outperforming YOLOv11n by 5.8%) and runs at 139.5 FPS on a Jetson AGX Xavier with TensorRT FP16 quantization. The results validate its effectiveness for real-time road condition perception in intelligent suspension systems.

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do. Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame. This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both (\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction (RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction; (\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and training logs are available as the supplement.

To accommodate for these limitations and exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression. During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores, filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model, supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms. Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT. Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO 2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is 5x that of MobileViT-X.

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration, enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent, and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera intrinsics and extrinsics.

Applying these methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints, occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery. This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of 91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval (OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues, regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories. Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

<title>Spatial-Frequency Aware for Object Detection in RAW Image</title>

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data (unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the ``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma parameters for the two domains.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics, object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7 to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

arXiv:2508.01427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/NiceRingNode/SPECTRUM.

<title>Hyperspectral Image Recovery Constrained by Multi-Granularity Non-Local Self-Similarity Priors</title>

arXiv:2508.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance. However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices. The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local, and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy, mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25 and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation, Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability, highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space, scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes, making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment. Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast and accurate volumetric tumor delineation, combining scalability, interpretability, and generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection (MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability. Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even against unseen generators like Sora.

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks, small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%, 94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9, 15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life. However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than 100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training. This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run directly on smartphones.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden. Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM. Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and accuracy for video RAG tasks.

arXiv:2508.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity, often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience. Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation (EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion, web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is available at: https://github.com/kding1225/EvoVLMA

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense, stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes. This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network, which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models. Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

<title>TopoImages: Incorporating Local Topology Encoding into Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops, play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects). %
Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. %
In this paper, we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images), which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology of patches. %
In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. %
Our main objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input image into a vectorized form. %
Specifically, we first compute persistence diagrams (PDs) of the patches, %
and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into long vectors for pixels of the patches. %
The resulting multi-channel image-form representation is called a TopoImage. %
TopoImages offers a new perspective for data analysis. %
To garner diverse and significant topological features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. %
The multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based classification, with considerable improvement. %
Our TopoImages approach is highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks. Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Harnessing Textual Semantic Priors for Knowledge Transfer and Refinement in CLIP-Driven Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored. During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation (SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier. Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>Set Pivot Learning: Redefining Generalized Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs, which is more suitable for current research and application requirements. Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii) VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness. Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

<title>A Spatio-temporal Continuous Network for Stochastic 3D Human Motion Prediction</title>

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields, existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition, the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution (GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.

<title>Self-Navigated Residual Mamba for Universal Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages ``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions. Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD, MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

arXiv:2508.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art results. Code will be available.

<title>CLIMD: A Curriculum Learning Framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01594</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios, due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis (CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

<title>Enhancing Zero-Shot Brain Tumor Subtype Classification via Fine-Grained Patch-Text Alignment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

<title>Towards Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection via Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning. However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e., the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61% and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage datasets, respectively.

<title>From Pixels to Places: A Systematic Benchmark for Evaluating Image Geolocalization Ability in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open- and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building geolocation-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks: 84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

<title>Rate-distortion Optimized Point Cloud Preprocessing for Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression</title>

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices. However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera, with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency, reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution. Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of collisions with glass objects.

<title>Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction</title>

arXiv:2508.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness. Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction, embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of the map-level decoding strategy.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover, most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial level set function from image features and the point input, which then progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric modeling under weak guidance.

<title>Shape Distribution Matters: Shape-specific Mixture-of-Experts for Amodal Segmentation under Diverse Occlusions</title>

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically, ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

<title>Rein++: Efficient Generalization and Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01667</link>

arXiv:2508.01667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios. Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable, instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g., daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g., nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of parameters.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models. We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as 2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to 13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

<title>Cure or Poison? Embedding Instructions Visually Alters Hallucination in Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01678</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance, increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly. Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

<title>DisCo3D: Distilling Multi-View Consistency for 3D Scene Editing</title>

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D}, a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing quality.

<title>Register Anything: Estimating "Corresponding Prompts" for Segment Anything Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01697</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images. In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models (e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X, such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts, inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and, as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

arXiv:2508.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this, we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens (e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

<title>LT-Gaussian: Long-Term Map Update Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving</title>

arXiv:2508.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components: Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently, during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID, a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and (ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations. Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing datasets. We present HateClipSeg, a large-scale multimodal dataset with both video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting, Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches. The HateClipSeg dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/HateClipSeg.git.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound, concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification models.

<title>Tracking the Unstable: Appearance-Guided Motion Modeling for Robust Multi-Object Tracking in UAV-Captured Videos</title>

arXiv:2508.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions. Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA) that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website: https://github.com/YuxiangZhang-BIT.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions, but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key designs of our approach.

<title>Simulated Ensemble Attack: Transferring Jailbreaks Across Fine-tuned Vision-Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack (SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across the entire model lifecycle.

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies, where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1) underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2) neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

<title>Improving Noise Efficiency in Privacy-preserving Dataset Distillation</title>

arXiv:2508.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns. Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation, Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with 50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth} the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

<title>VPN: Visual Prompt Navigation</title>

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation.

<title>DiffSemanticFusion: Semantic Raster BEV Fusion for Autonomous Driving via Online HD Map Diffusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01778</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition, extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance performance. All artifacts are available at https://github.com/SunZhigang7/DiffSemanticFusion.

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features. This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhangXiaotong015/GrPn.

<title>CSLRConformer: A Data-Centric Conformer Approach for Continuous Arabic Sign Language Recognition on the Isharah Datase</title>

arXiv:2508.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed, centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline, and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in keypoint-based CSLR.

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data, we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure; first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally, the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise, an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated through extensive experiments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in https://github.com/Wickyan/OmniEvent .

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy, evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

<title>Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional entropy model.

<title>Distinguishing Target and Non-Target Fixations with EEG and Eye Tracking in Realistic Visual Scenes</title>

arXiv:2508.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a 36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials, which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps, which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall effectiveness.

arXiv:2508.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

<title>Medical Image De-Identification Resources: Synthetic DICOM Data and Tools for Validation</title>

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers, preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing), 605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams. Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image sharing.

<title>EgoTrigger: Toward Audio-Driven Image Capture for Human Memory Enhancement in All-Day Energy-Efficient Smart Glasses</title>

arXiv:2508.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach, EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components (e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use -- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection, and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally, we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images, setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell instance segmentation tasks.

<title>Proactive Disentangled Modeling of Trigger-Object Pairings for Backdoor Defense</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training pipelines.

Abstract: We present a novel multi-altitude camera pose estimation system, addressing the challenges of robust and accurate localization across varied altitudes when only considering sparse image input. The system effectively handles diverse environmental conditions and viewpoint variations by integrating the cross-view transformer, deep features, and structure-from-motion into a unified framework. To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly collected datasets specifically tailored for multi-altitude camera pose estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in both accuracy and robustness for multi-altitude sparse pose estimation tasks compared to existing solutions, making it well suited for real-world robotic applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated inspection.

<title>Self-Supervised YOLO: Leveraging Contrastive Learning for Label-Efficient Object Detection</title>

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders, employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance, especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8 achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2) Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&amp;A methods rely on explicit program execution, where the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly constructed motion Q\&amp;A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/LUNAProject22/IMoRe.

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

<title>Fast and Memory-efficient Non-line-of-sight Imaging with Quasi-Fresnel Transform</title>

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions, overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption, limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its applicability across a wider range of platforms.

<title>Devil is in the Detail: Towards Injecting Fine Details of Image Prompt in Image Generation via Conflict-free Guidance and Stratified Attention</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02004</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt. This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer, generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance. Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully reflecting the image prompt.

<title>Bench2ADVLM: A Closed-Loop Benchmark for Vision-language Models in Autonomous Driving</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02028</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience, and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design, heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution. Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop conditions.

<title>Protego: User-Centric Pose-Invariant Privacy Protection Against Face Recognition-Induced Digital Footprint Exposure</title>

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves. Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall, Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance and unsolicited identity tracing.

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming, trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases) and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs (MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further, we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2 model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

arXiv:2508.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency; fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on CLIC2020-mobile.

<title>StarPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language, complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized, high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness, physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities, including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction, showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized adapter integration.

<title>DeflareMamba: Hierarchical Vision Mamba for Contextually Consistent Lens Flare Removal</title>

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/BNU-ERC-ITEA/DeflareMamba.

<title>Beyond RGB and Events: Enhancing Object Detection under Adverse Lighting with Monocular Normal Maps</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02127</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features, and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by 7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

<title>VDEGaussian: Video Diffusion Enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Urban Scenes Modeling</title>

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses, and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view synthesis over baseline approaches.

<title>A Neural Quality Metric for BRDF Models</title>

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative for evaluating BRDF models.

<title>Free-MoRef: Instantly Multiplexing Context Perception Capabilities of Video-MLLMs within Single Inference</title>

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency. Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach \textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/wkfdb/Free-MoRef

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution, we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a 15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

<title>TrackletGait: A Robust Framework for Gait Recognition in the Wild</title>

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters. Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors affecting gait recognition in the wild.

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues, we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition. Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical utility across diverse generation scenarios.

arXiv:2508.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed, which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing, and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution image.

arXiv:2508.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image information.

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation. For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275, improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/Fischer-Tom/unified-detection-and-pose-estimation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters, making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix, \underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches. Our code is publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EST-LoRA-F318.

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform, white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts. Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts, such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion, primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive computational cost.

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance, the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency, achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are publicly available at \href{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}.

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research. Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information, like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes.

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning (WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks. The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics.

<title>Test-Time Model Adaptation for Quantized Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data. Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset.

<title>Failure Cases Are Better Learned But Boundary Says Sorry: Facilitating Smooth Perception Change for Accuracy-Robustness Trade-Off in Adversarial Training</title>

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) works.

<title>CMIC: Content-Adaptive Mamba for Learned Image Compression</title>

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However, vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.

<title>An Event-based Fast Intensity Reconstruction Scheme for UAV Real-time Perception</title>

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras. The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm. Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate, typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

<title>Forecasting When to Forecast: Accelerating Diffusion Models with Confidence-Gated Taylor</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections. This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task. When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%, 5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/ziyan-xiaoyu/I2CR/.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics. Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

<title>Patho-AgenticRAG: Towards Multimodal Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Pathology VLMs via Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases, limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search, enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the Patho-AgenticRAG repository: https://github.com/Wenchuan-Zhang/Patho-AgenticRAG.

<title>SplatSSC: Decoupled Depth-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Semantic Scene Completion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released upon acceptance.

<title>Semi-Supervised Dual-Threshold Contrastive Learning for Ultrasound Image Classification and Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover, segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning, where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy. However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network (SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers: SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy (0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance. However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities. In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw data only.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios. Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution, offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both. Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at https://github.com/mickeykang16/Ev-Stereo3D.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning, which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data. CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2 with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all datasets.

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention. However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools. We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for early personalized risk stratification.

<title>Is Uncertainty Quantification a Viable Alternative to Learned Deferral?</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift. Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2) Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives, empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Abstract: Volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image is crucial for a broad range of applications like autonomous driving and robotics. Recent volumetric reconstruction methods achieve impressive results, but generally require expensive 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision. We propose to leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models and depth prediction models to generate synthetic scene geometry from a single image. This can then be used to distill a feed-forward scene reconstruction model. Our experiments on the challenging KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines that use multi-view supervision, and offers unique advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection, filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering, evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result, Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical ($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors). Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset. "Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

<title>Learning Partially-Decorrelated Common Spaces for Ad-hoc Video Search</title>

arXiv:2508.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces, yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations: feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss. Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems. While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking face generation.

arXiv:2508.02363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9% improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation across diverse editing scenarios.

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text, and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions. For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID. Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics chains.

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose \textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation, human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts. Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation. However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities: visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral, and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories, instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image. We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models, but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

<title>Hydra: Accurate Multi-Modal Leaf Wetness Sensing with mm-Wave and Camera Fusion</title>

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images. Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables. Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables. After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.

<title>Modality Bias in LVLMs: Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination via Attention Lens</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02419</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs, generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens, balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions. Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting its generalizability and efficacy.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images, exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods. Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on segmentation.

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques. Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data. Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of 92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

<title>SAMPO: Visual Preference Optimization for Intent-Aware Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO (Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning. Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9 percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted preference learning.

<title>Multi-class Image Anomaly Detection for Practical Applications: Requirements and Robust Solutions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks, aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly, previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap. However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios, determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$) is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision, we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments. (2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

<title>Low-Frequency First: Eliminating Floating Artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02493</link>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS), which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion, effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of 1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our implementation will be released on GitHub.

<title>Rethinking Transparent Object Grasping: Depth Completion with Monocular Depth Estimation and Instance Mask</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02507</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth, expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values. However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this, we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization capability.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background. Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc., but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities. Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably, VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on short-form video engagement prediction.

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns, particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception models.

<title>Precision-Aware Video Compression for Reducing Bandwidth Requirements in Video Communication for Vehicle Detection-Based Applications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02533</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality. This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions, suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to 8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to 72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However, current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97% improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M.

<title>Evaluating Variance in Visual Question Answering Benchmarks</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements, the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates, overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism, model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability. Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages: 1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery: restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.

<title>Raw Data Matters: Enhancing Prompt Tuning by Internal Augmentation on Vision-Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach. Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically, AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues, limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i) a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness, particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

Abstract: Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts: FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency. Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and dataset can be accessible via link: https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/fairfedmed/.

<title>FRAM: Frobenius-Regularized Assignment Matching with Mixed-Precision Computing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However, these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4% (real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for precision harvesting.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice, observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes, forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

Abstract: This retrospective study evaluated five VLMs (Qwen2.5, Phi-4, Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Mistral3.1) using the MedFMC dataset. This dataset includes 22,349 images from 7,461 patients encompassing chest radiography (19 disease multi-label classifications), colon pathology (tumor detection), endoscopy (colorectal lesion identification), neonatal jaundice assessment (skin color-based treatment necessity), and retinal fundoscopy (5-point diabetic retinopathy grading). Diagnostic accuracy was compared in three experimental settings: visual input only, multimodal input, and chain-of-thought reasoning. Model accuracy was assessed against ground truth labels, with statistical comparisons using bootstrapped confidence intervals (p<.05). Qwen2.5 achieved the highest accuracy for chest radiographs (90.4%) and endoscopy images (84.2%), significantly outperforming the other models (p<.001). In colon pathology, Qwen2.5 (69.0%) and Phi-4 (69.6%) performed comparably (p=.41), both significantly exceeding other VLMs (p<.001). Similarly, for neonatal jaundice assessment, Qwen2.5 (58.3%) and Phi-4 (58.1%) showed comparable leading accuracies (p=.93) significantly exceeding their counterparts (p<.001). All models struggled with retinal fundoscopy; Qwen2.5 and Gemma3 achieved the highest, albeit modest, accuracies at 18.6% (comparable, p=.99), significantly better than other tested models (p<.001). Unexpectedly, multimodal input reduced accuracy for some models and modalities, and chain-of-thought reasoning prompts also failed to improve accuracy. The open-source VLMs demonstrated promising diagnostic capabilities, particularly in chest radiograph interpretation. However, performance in complex domains such as retinal fundoscopy was limited, underscoring the need for further development and domain-specific adaptation before widespread clinical application.

<title>ReCoSeg++:Extended Residual-Guided Cross-Modal Diffusion for Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset, outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU: $85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world, multi-center MRI datasets.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents. While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges, including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline. Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100% success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses.

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT) tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at https://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT.

<title>Point-wise Diffusion Models for Physical Systems with Shape Variations: Application to Spatio-temporal and Large-scale system</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to 200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+ samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies, significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding, highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

<title>CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to Amyloid PET Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.

<title>SWAN: Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network for Infrared Small Target Detection</title>

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is thus critical in both civilian and military applications. This study addresses the challenge of precisely IRSTD in complex backgrounds. Recent methods focus fundamental reliance on conventional convolution operations, which primarily capture local spatial patterns and struggle to distinguish the unique frequency-domain characteristics of small targets from intricate background clutter. To overcome these limitations, we proposed the Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network (SWAN), a novel framework designed to perceive targets from both spatial and frequency domains. SWAN leverages a Haar Wavelet Convolution (HWConv) for a deep, cross-domain fusion of the frequency energy and spatial details of small target. Furthermore, a Shifted Spatial Attention (SSA) mechanism efficiently models long-range spatial dependencies with linear computational complexity, enhancing contextual awareness. Finally, a Residual Dual-Channel Attention (RDCA) module adaptively calibrates channel-wise feature responses to suppress background interference while amplifying target-pertinent signals. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SWAN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness, particularly in complex challenging scenarios.

Abstract: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the interpretation of medical images. However, conventional CNNs typically demand extensive computational resources and large training datasets. To address these limitations, this study applied transfer learning to achieve strong classification performance using fewer training samples. Specifically, the study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

<title>Predicting EGFR Mutation in LUAD from Histopathological Whole-Slide Images Using Pretrained Foundation Model and Transfer Learning: An Indian Cohort Study</title>

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&amp;E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&amp;E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified 3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner. Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to category-specific methods.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community

Abstract: Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D) T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark (OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups. Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of the overall architecture.

Abstract: The parcellation of Cranial Nerves (CNs) serves as a crucial quantitative methodology for evaluating the morphological characteristics and anatomical pathways of specific CNs. Multi-modal CNs parcellation networks have achieved promising segmentation performance, which combine structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI. However, insufficient exploration of diffusion MRI information has led to low performance of existing multi-modal fusion. In this work, we propose a tractography-guided Dual-label Collaborative Learning Network (DCLNet) for multi-modal CNs parcellation. The key contribution of our DCLNet is the introduction of coarse labels of CNs obtained from fiber tractography through CN atlas, and collaborative learning with precise labels annotated by experts. Meanwhile, we introduce a Modality-adaptive Encoder Module (MEM) to achieve soft information swapping between structural MRI and diffusion MRI. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate performance improvements compared to single-label network. This systematic validation underscores the effectiveness of dual-label strategies in addressing inherent ambiguities in CNs parcellation tasks.

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance. Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art methods in in-betweening motion generation task.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Abstract: The ability to predict the attention of expert pathologists could lead to decision support systems for better pathology training. We developed methods to predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists' attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m (magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs, and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty, caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction. Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions. Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports, often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical decision support.

However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR, an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

<title>OccamVTS: Distilling Vision Models to 1% Parameters for Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach. Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from 124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA, CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C, convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters. Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH segmentation.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promis ing progress in lossless image compression. However, di rectly adopting existing paradigms for medical images suf fers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
  performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based
  compressors often overlook the security of the compres sion process, which is critical in modern medical scenarios.
  To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression
  and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing
  (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages
  into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this in sight, an adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first
  devised to partition the entire image into two segments, pro viding global and local modalities for subsequent dual-path
  lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we inno vatively propose a segmented message steganography algo rithm within the local modality path to ensure the security of
  the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatom ical priors-based low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning
  strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the su periority of our proposed method in terms of compression ra tios, efficiency, and security. The source code will be made
  publicly available.

Abstract: In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual objects interact with real objects. However, the lack of physicality of virtual objects leads to the absence of natural sonic interactions. When virtual and real objects collide, either no sound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory experience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality (VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback of pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that dynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual congruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in AR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer vision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's physical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to generate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis. In a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based sounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of non-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that material-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions. Material-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar materials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence. These findings show that context-aware, material-based sonic interactions in AR foster a stronger sense of realism and enhance our perception of real-world surroundings.

Abstract: Accurate breast tumor segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is important for downstream tasks such as pathological complete response (pCR) assessment. In this work, we address both segmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI dataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage training strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels using the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned features to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen validation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of 0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR classification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic features extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast DCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\%, and up to 75\% in some subgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive fields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on advanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further improve performance and generalization.

Abstract: For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks, they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene (navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent). Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e., without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found. Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs. informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but offering much greater flexibility

Abstract: This work presents the results of a methodological transfer from remote sensing to healthcare, adapting AMBER -- a transformer-based model originally designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

<title>ROVER: Recursive Reasoning Over Videos with Vision-Language Models for Embodied Tasks</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

Abstract: Audio-visual temporal deepfake localization under the content-driven partial manipulation remains a highly challenging task. In this scenario, the deepfake regions are usually only spanning a few frames, with the majority of the rest remaining identical to the original. To tackle this, we propose a Hierarchical Boundary Modeling Network (HBMNet), which includes three modules: an Audio-Visual Feature Encoder that extracts discriminative frame-level representations, a Coarse Proposal Generator that predicts candidate boundary regions, and a Fine-grained Probabilities Generator that refines these proposals using bidirectional boundary-content probabilities. From the modality perspective, we enhance audio-visual learning through dedicated encoding and fusion, reinforced by frame-level supervision to boost discriminability. From the temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional boundary-content relationships. Experiments show that encoding and fusion primarily improve precision, while frame-level supervision boosts recall. Each module (audio-visual fusion, temporal scales, bi-directionality) contributes complementary benefits, collectively enhancing localization performance. HBMNet outperforms BA-TFD and UMMAFormer and shows improved potential scalability with more training data.

Abstract: Reliable and interpretable tumor classification from clinical imaging remains a core challenge due to heterogeneous modality quality, limited annotations, and the lack of structured anatomical guidance. We introduce REACT-KD, a Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that transfers rich supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a lightweight CT-based student model. The framework uses a dual teacher design: one branch captures structure-function relationships using dual-tracer PET/CT, and the other models dose-aware features through synthetically degraded low-dose CT data. These branches jointly guide the student model through two complementary objectives. The first focuses on semantic alignment via logits distillation, while the second models anatomical topology using region graph distillation. A shared CBAM-3D module is employed to maintain consistent attention across modalities. To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD introduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial or noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is conducted as a case study. REACT-KD achieves an average AUC of 93.4% on an internal PET/CT cohort and maintains 76.6% to 81.5% AUC across varying dose levels in external CT testing. Decision curve analysis shows that REACT-KD consistently provides the highest clinical benefit across decision thresholds, supporting its potential in real-world diagnostics.

Abstract: Reversible image conversion (RIC) suffers from ill-posedness issues due to its forward conversion process being considered an underdetermined system. Despite employing invertible neural networks (INN), existing RIC methods intrinsically remain ill-posed as inevitably introducing uncertainty by incorporating randomly sampled variables. To tackle the ill-posedness dilemma, we focus on developing a reliable approximate left inverse for the underdetermined system by constructing an overdetermined system with a non-zero Gram determinant, thus ensuring a well-posed solution. Based on this principle, we propose a well-posed invertible $1\times1$ convolution (WIC), which eliminates the reliance on random variable sampling and enables the development of well-posed invertible networks. Furthermore, we design two innovative networks, WIN-Na\"ive and WIN, with the latter incorporating advanced skip-connections to enhance long-term memory. Our methods are evaluated across diverse RIC tasks, including reversible image hiding, image rescaling, and image decolorization, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to overcome the bottlenecks of existing RIC solutions and setting a new benchmark in the field. Codes are available in https://github.com/BNU-ERC-ITEA/WIN.

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However, existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot, text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

<title>Toward a reliable PWM-based light-emitting diode visual stimulus for improved SSVEP response with minimal visual fatigue</title>

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints. Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95% generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of SSVEP for practical applications.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise, particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error $\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper, we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for CT reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on the average gradient magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These results highlight the applicability of GR-Gaussian for accurate CT reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes. Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of 3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic testing.

<title>Uncertainty Estimation for Novel Views in Gaussian Splatting from Primitive-Based Representations of Error and Visibility</title>

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method, investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes, allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.

<title>Clinical Expert Uncertainty Guided Generalized Label Smoothing for Medical Noisy Label Learning</title>

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However, these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or ``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition (ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes. Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and accompanied by publicly released models and code. Models and code are available at https://www.github.com/adipiz99/lava-framework.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&amp;E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual IHC synthesis.

<title>RL-U$^2$Net: A Dual-Branch UNet with Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Multimodal Feature Fusion for Accurate 3D Whole-Heart Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal 3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

<title>Explainable AI Methods for Neuroimaging: Systematic Failures of Common Tools, the Need for Domain-Specific Validation, and a Proposal for Safe Application</title>

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad, which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Geometry-aware Neural Interpolation (Geo-NI) framework for light field rendering. Previous learning-based approaches either rely on the capability of neural networks to perform direct interpolation, which we dubbed Neural Interpolation (NI), or explore scene geometry for novel view synthesis, also known as Depth Image-Based Rendering (DIBR). Instead, we incorporate the ideas behind these two kinds of approaches by launching the NI with a novel DIBR pipeline. Specifically, the proposed Geo-NI first performs NI using input light field sheared by a set of depth hypotheses. Then the DIBR is implemented by assigning the sheared light fields with a novel reconstruction cost volume according to the reconstruction quality under different depth hypotheses. The reconstruction cost is interpreted as a blending weight to render the final output light field by blending the reconstructed light fields along the dimension of depth hypothesis. By combining the superiorities of NI and DIBR, the proposed Geo-NI is able to render views with large disparity with the help of scene geometry while also reconstruct non-Lambertian effect when depth is prone to be ambiguous. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed geometry-aware light field rendering framework.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, in which DNNs are misled to false outputs due to inputs containing imperceptible perturbations. Adversarial training, a reliable and effective method of defense, may significantly reduce the vulnerability of neural networks and becomes the de facto standard for robust learning. While many recent works practice the data-centric philosophy, such as how to generate better adversarial examples or use generative models to produce additional training data, we look back to the models themselves and revisit the adversarial robustness from the perspective of deep feature distribution as an insightful complementarity. In this paper, we propose \textit{Branch Orthogonality adveRsarial Training} (BORT) to obtain state-of-the-art performance with solely the original dataset for adversarial training. To practice our design idea of integrating multiple orthogonal solution spaces, we leverage a simple and straightforward multi-branch neural network that eclipses adversarial attacks with no increase in inference time. We heuristically propose a corresponding loss function, branch-orthogonal loss, to make each solution space of the multi-branch model orthogonal. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN against $\ell_{\infty}$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\epsilon = 8/255$, respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted to show that our method goes beyond all state-of-the-art methods without any tricks. Compared to all methods that do not use additional data for training, our models achieve 67.3\% and 41.5\% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (improving upon the state-of-the-art by +7.23\% and +9.07\%). We also outperform methods using a training set with a far larger scale than ours.

Abstract: Segmentation is a crucial analysis task in biomedical imaging. Given the diverse experimental settings in this field, the lack of generalization limits the use of deep learning in practice. Domain adaptation is a promising remedy: it involves training a model for a given task on a source dataset with labels and adapts it to a target dataset without additional labels. We introduce a probabilistic domain adaptation method, building on self-training approaches and the Probabilistic UNet. We use the latter to sample multiple segmentation hypotheses to implement better pseudo-label filtering. We further study joint and separate source-target training strategies and evaluate our method on three challenging domain adaptation tasks for biomedical segmentation. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/Probabilistic-Domain-Adaptation.

Abstract: Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA) is a challenging task due to its subjective nature and expensive manual annotations. Recent large-scale vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have shown their promising representation capability for various downstream tasks. However, the application of CLIP to resource-constrained and low-data IAA tasks remains limited. While few attempts to leverage CLIP in IAA have mainly focused on carefully designed prompts, we extend beyond this by allowing models from different domains and with different model sizes to acquire knowledge from CLIP. To achieve this, we propose a unified and flexible two-phase CLIP-based Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) paradigm, aiming to learn a lightweight IAA model while leveraging CLIP's strong generalization capability. Specifically, CSKD employs a feature alignment strategy to facilitate the distillation of heterogeneous CLIP teacher and IAA student models, effectively transferring valuable features from pre-trained visual representations to two lightweight IAA models, respectively. To efficiently adapt to downstream IAA tasks in a low-data regime, the two strong visual aesthetics learners then conduct distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge collaboratively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple widely used IAA benchmarks. Furthermore, analysis of attention distance and entropy before and after feature alignment shows the effective transfer of CLIP's feature representation to IAA models, which not only provides valuable guidance for the model initialization of IAA but also enhances the aesthetic feature representation of IAA models. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel multimodal food recognition framework that effectively combines visual and textual modalities to enhance classification accuracy and robustness. The proposed approach employs a dynamic multimodal fusion strategy that adaptively integrates features from unimodal visual inputs and complementary textual metadata. This fusion mechanism is designed to maximize the use of informative content, while mitigating the adverse impact of missing or inconsistent modality data. The framework was rigorously evaluated on the UPMC Food-101 dataset and achieved unimodal classification accuracies of 73.60% for images and 88.84% for text. When both modalities were fused, the model achieved an accuracy of 97.84%, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrated the robustness, adaptability, and computational efficiency of the proposed settings, highlighting its practical applicability to real-world multimodal food-recognition scenarios.

Abstract: A major source of endoscopic tissue tracking errors during deformations stems from wrong data association between observed sensor measurements with previously tracked scene. To mitigate this issue, we present a surgical perception framework, SuPerPM, that leverages learning-based non-rigid point cloud matching for data association, thus accommodating larger deformations than previous approaches which relied on Iterative Closest Point (ICP) for point associations. The learning models typically require training data with ground truth point cloud correspondences, which is challenging or even impractical to collect in surgical environments. Thus, for tuning the learning model, we gather endoscopic data of soft tissue being manipulated by a surgical robot and then establish correspondences between point clouds at different time points to serve as ground truth. This was achieved by employing a position-based dynamics (PBD) simulation to ensure that the correspondences adhered to physical constraints. The proposed framework is demonstrated on several challenging surgical datasets that are characterized by large deformations, achieving superior performance over advanced surgical scene tracking algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for joint grounded scene graph - image generation, a challenging task involving high-dimensional, multi-modal structured data. To effectively model this complex joint distribution, we adopt a factorized approach: first generating a grounded scene graph, followed by image generation conditioned on the generated grounded scene graph. While conditional image generation has been widely explored in the literature, our primary focus is on the generation of grounded scene graphs from noise, which provides efficient and interpretable control over the image generation process. This task requires generating plausible grounded scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for both nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), encompassing continuous attributes (e.g., object bounding boxes) and discrete attributes (e.g., object and relation categories). To address this challenge, we introduce DiffuseSG, a novel diffusion model that jointly models the heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore different encoding strategies to effectively handle the categorical data. Leveraging a graph transformer as the denoiser, DiffuseSG progressively refines grounded scene graph representations in a continuous space before discretizing them to generate structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce an IoU-based regularization term to enhance empirical performance. Our model outperforms existing methods in grounded scene graph generation on the VG and COCO-Stuff datasets, excelling in both standard and newly introduced metrics that more accurately capture the task's complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broader applicability of DiffuseSG in two important downstream tasks: 1) achieving superior results in a range of grounded scene graph completion tasks, and 2) enhancing grounded scene graph detection models by leveraging additional training samples generated by DiffuseSG.

Abstract: Generating dynamic 3D object from a single-view video is challenging due to the lack of 4D labeled data. An intuitive approach is to extend previous image-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling.However, this approach would be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to directly reconstruct the 4D content through a 4D Gaussian splatting model. Importantly, our method can achieve real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories. To enable robust reconstruction under sparse views, we introduce inconsistency-aware confidence-weighted loss design, along with a lightly weighted score distillation loss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis. For example, Efficient4D takes only 10 minutes to model a dynamic object, vs 120 minutes by the previous art model Consistent4D.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for video understanding are primarily fine-tuned with various videos scraped from online platforms. Existing datasets, such as ActivityNet, require considerable human labor for structuring and annotation before effectively utilized for tuning LVLMs. While current LVLMs are primarily trained on existing datasets in broad, general-purpose settings, adapting them to specific downstream scenarios remains challenging, as collecting and annotating task-specific videos is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage framework named DreamFrame for automatically generating style-consistent keyframes and corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs to support LVLM instruction tuning. DreamFrame generates datasets in a movie-like manner. First, we utilize an LLM to generate structured movie plots including movie prior information (like overview and style), frame descriptions and plot-related QA pairs, with a story expansion strategy to mitigate context length limitations.Then, to ensure visual consistency across generated frames, we design a Style Immobilization Process which maintains consistent style through an embedding learning strategy. Finally, frame descriptions and style embeddings are integrated to produce coherent keyframes. Using DreamFrame, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 1k stylized keyframe-like videos and 100k diverse QA pairs. Extensive fine-tuned experiments on various LVLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Furthermore, based on the proposed dataset, we fine-tune a new LVLM named DreamFrame-7B, which significantly surpasses the previous similar-sized LVLMs across different benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Part-Aware Point Grounded Description (PaPGD), a challenging task aimed at advancing 3D multimodal learning for fine-grained, part-aware segmentation grounding and detailed explanation of 3D objects. Existing 3D datasets largely focus on either vision-only part segmentation or vision-language scene segmentation, lacking the fine-grained multimodal segmentation needed for robotic navigation and interaction in real-world environments. To address this gap, we present the 3DCoMPaT Grounded Instructions (3DCoMPaT-GrIn) Dataset, a comprehensive resource that pairs rich point cloud descriptions with corresponding part-level segmentation masks. This dataset encompasses extensive samples designed for both PaPGD and fine-grained single-part grounding tasks. To tackle the inherent challenges of grounding objects and generating grounded descriptions at the part level, we propose Kestrel, a part-aware 3D multimodal large language model that integrates an advanced language model for nuanced language comprehension with multi-level point feature propagation and query refinement mechanism to enhance spatial reasoning at the part level. The extensive experiments demonstrate that Kestrel effectively bridges the gap between part-aware language understanding and 3D segmentation grounding, paving the way for more robust and interpretable 3D object comprehension that meets the demands of real-world robotic applications.

Although it has shown promise in image classification tasks, its extension to other visual tasks has been limited. This limitation arises primarily from two factors: 1) architectures designed specifically for classification are not readily adaptable to other tasks, which prevents the effective reuse of task-specific knowledge from architectures tailored to different problems; 2) these classification-focused architectures typically lack cross-scale feature communication, leading to degraded performance in tasks like object detection and super-resolution. To address these challenges, we propose the Feature Bank Augmented auxiliary network (FBA), which introduces a simplified design principle and incorporates a feature bank to enhance cross-task adaptability and communication. This work represents the first successful application of local learning methods beyond classification, demonstrating that FBA not only conserves GPU memory but also achieves performance on par with end-to-end approaches across multiple datasets for various visual tasks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Object Detection (OV-3DDet) addresses the detection of objects from an arbitrary list of novel categories in 3D scenes, which remains a very challenging problem. In this work, we propose CoDAv2, a unified framework designed to innovatively tackle both the localization and classification of novel 3D objects, under the condition of limited base categories. For localization, the proposed 3D Novel Object Discovery (3D-NOD) strategy utilizes 3D geometries and 2D open-vocabulary semantic priors to discover pseudo labels for novel objects during training. 3D-NOD is further extended with an Enrichment strategy that significantly enriches the novel object distribution in the training scenes, and then enhances the model's ability to localize more novel objects. The 3D-NOD with Enrichment is termed 3D-NODE. For classification, the Discovery-driven Cross-modal Alignment (DCMA) module aligns features from 3D point clouds and 2D/textual modalities, employing both class-agnostic and class-specific alignments that are iteratively refined to handle the expanding vocabulary of objects. Besides, 2D box guidance boosts the classification accuracy against complex background noises, which is coined as Box-DCMA. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of CoDAv2. CoDAv2 outperforms the best-performing method by a large margin (AP_Novel of 9.17 vs. 3.61 on SUN-RGBD and 9.12 vs. 3.74 on ScanNetv2). Source code and pre-trained models are available at the GitHub project page.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) present fundamental computational challenges due to their gigapixel-scale resolutions and sparse, irregularly distributed informative regions. Conventional patch-based methods inevitably distort spatial relationships or treat patches as independent samples, while traditional attention mechanisms, designed for dense, uniformly distributed data, are computationally impractical for WSIs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse-native computational framework that preserves exact spatial relationships, unlocking advanced modeling techniques and bridging a long-standing gap between WSI analysis and general vision. Based on this framework, we develop Sparse Pyramid Attention Networks (SPAN), incorporating a hierarchical sparse pyramid attention architecture with shifted windows that efficiently directs computational resources to informative regions. SPAN comprises two key modules: Spatial-Adaptive Feature Condensation, which progressively builds multi-scale representations from a single-scale input through sparse downsampling, and Context-Aware Feature Refinement, which captures long-range dependencies via shifted windows and global tokens. Evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate SPAN's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating both our framework's effectiveness and SPAN's specific advantages in capturing contextual and hierachical representations that existing methods fundamentally cannot model. Our work establishes a new paradigm for WSI analysis that overcomes long-standing computational barriers. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to develop agents capable of navigating in realistic environments. While recent cross-modal training approaches have significantly improved navigation performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, aerial navigation over real-world cities remains underexplored primarily due to limited datasets and the difficulty of integrating visual and geographic information. To fill this gap, we introduce CityNav, the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial VLN. Our dataset consists of 32,637 human demonstration trajectories, each paired with a natural language description, covering 4.65 km$^2$ across two real cities: Cambridge and Birmingham. In contrast to existing datasets composed of synthetic scenes such as AerialVLN, our dataset presents a unique challenge because agents must interpret spatial relationships between real-world landmarks and the navigation destination, making CityNav an essential benchmark for advancing aerial VLN. Furthermore, as an initial step toward addressing this challenge, we provide a methodology of creating geographic semantic maps that can be used as an auxiliary modality input during navigation. In our experiments, we compare performance of three representative aerial VLN agents (Seq2seq, CMA and AerialVLN models) and demonstrate that the semantic map representation significantly improves their navigation performance.

Abstract: Comprehending natural language instructions is a charming property for both 2D and 3D layout synthesis systems. Existing methods implicitly model object joint distributions and express object relations, hindering generation's controllability. We introduce InstructLayout, a novel generative framework that integrates a semantic graph prior and a layout decoder to improve controllability and fidelity for 2D and 3D layout synthesis. The proposed semantic graph prior learns layout appearances and object distributions simultaneously, demonstrating versatility across various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. To facilitate the benchmarking for text-driven 2D and 3D scene synthesis, we respectively curate two high-quality datasets of layout-instruction pairs from public Internet resources with large language and multimodal models. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in both 2D and 3D layout synthesis tasks. Thorough ablation studies confirm the efficacy of crucial design components.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently shown notable success in various visual tasks. However, in terms of discriminability, SSL is still not on par with supervised learning (SL). This paper identifies a key issue, the ``crowding problem," where features from different classes are not well-separated, and there is high intra-class variance. In contrast, SL ensures clear class separation. Our analysis reveals that SSL objectives do not adequately constrain the relationships between samples and their augmentations, leading to poorer performance in complex tasks. We further establish a theoretical framework that connects SSL objectives to cross-entropy risk bounds, explaining how reducing intra-class variance and increasing inter-class separation can improve generalization. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Semantic Adjuster (DSA), a learnable regulator that enhances feature aggregation and separation while being robust to outliers. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets validate that DSA leads to substantial gains in SSL performance, narrowing the performance gap with SL.

Abstract: The fine-tuning of large vision-language foundation models remains an underexplored area, particularly regarding its impact on learning gains and catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the significance of modality gaps in contrastive dual-encoders, we introduce the Inter-Intra Modal Measure (IIMM) - a predictive metric that quantifies the relationship between intra-modal image embedding similarity and inter-modal misalignment. Through extensive empirical analysis across four state-of-the-art vision-language models and five fine-tuning techniques, we establish a strong linear relationship: tasks with higher IIMM scores yield greater in-domain performance improvements but suffer from more pronounced out-of-domain degradation, with some parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods exhibiting severe forgetting. Compared to existing transferability measures, the IIMM demonstrates significantly stronger predictive power for accuracy changes post fine-tuning in dual-encoder models. Moreover, we provide a theoretical bound, proving that changes in IIMM are limited by the Wasserstein distance between pre- and post-fine-tuning embedding distributions, ensuring its stability and robustness as a predictive measure. With only a single forward pass of the target data, practitioners can leverage this key insight to evaluate the degree to which a model can be expected to improve following fine-tuning. When combined with prior knowledge of a model's performance across diverse tasks, the IIMM further enhances transferability predictions for novel tasks, offering a lightweight yet effective tool for guiding model adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as an effective representation for photorealistic rendering, but the underlying geometry, material, and lighting remain entangled, hindering scene editing. Existing GS-based methods struggle to disentangle these components under non-Lambertian conditions, especially in the presence of specularities and shadows. We propose \textbf{GS-ID}, an end-to-end framework for illumination decomposition that integrates adaptive light aggregation with diffusion-based material priors. In addition to a learnable environment map for ambient illumination, we model spatially-varying local lighting using anisotropic spherical Gaussian mixtures (SGMs) that are jointly optimized with scene content. To better capture cast shadows, we associate each splat with a learnable unit vector that encodes shadow directions from multiple light sources, further improving material and lighting estimation. By combining SGMs with intrinsic priors from diffusion models, GS-ID significantly reduces ambiguity in light-material-geometry interactions and achieves state-of-the-art performance on inverse rendering and relighting benchmarks. Experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-ID for downstream applications such as relighting and scene composition.

Abstract: Real-time high-accuracy optical flow estimation is critical for a variety of real-world robotic applications. However, current learning-based methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: methods that achieve high accuracy typically demand substantial processing power, while faster approaches tend to sacrifice precision. These fast approaches specifically falter in their generalization capabilities and do not perform well across diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we revisit the limitations of the SOTA methods and present NeuFlow-V2, a novel method that offers both - high accuracy in real-world datasets coupled with low computational overhead. In particular, we introduce a novel light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module to keep computational demands tractable while delivering accurate optical flow. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuFlow-V2 provides similar accuracy to SOTA methods while achieving 10x-70x speedups. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/neufieldrobotics/NeuFlow_v2.

Abstract: It has been widely substantiated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible and vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing studies mainly focus on performing attacks by corrupting targeted objects (physical attack) or images (digital attack), which is intuitively acceptable and understandable in terms of the attack's effectiveness. In contrast, our focus lies in conducting background adversarial attacks in both digital and physical domains, without causing any disruptions to the targeted objects themselves. Specifically, an effective background adversarial attack framework is proposed to attack anything, by which the attack efficacy generalizes well between diverse objects, models, and tasks. Technically, we approach the background adversarial attack as an iterative optimization problem, analogous to the process of DNN learning. Besides, we offer a theoretical demonstration of its convergence under a set of mild but sufficient conditions. To strengthen the attack efficacy and transferability, we propose a new ensemble strategy tailored for adversarial perturbations and introduce an improved smooth constraint for the seamless connection of integrated perturbations. We conduct comprehensive and rigorous experiments in both digital and physical domains across various objects, models, and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of attacking anything of the proposed method. The findings of this research substantiate the significant discrepancy between human and machine vision on the value of background variations, which play a far more critical role than previously recognized, necessitating a reevaluation of the robustness and reliability of DNNs. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/JiaweiLian/Attack_Anything

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale video-language models have shown significant potential for real-time planning and detailed interactions. However, their high computational demands and the scarcity of annotated datasets limit their practicality for academic researchers. In this work, we introduce VideoLLaMB, a novel and efficient framework for long video understanding that leverages recurrent memory bridges and temporal memory tokens to enable seamless encoding of entire video sequences with preserved semantic continuity. Central to our approach is a SceneTiling algorithm that segments videos into coherent semantic units, facilitating robust understanding across tasks without requiring additional training. VideoLLaMB achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing models by 4.2 points on four VideoQA benchmarks and by 2.06 points on egocentric planning tasks. Notably, it maintains strong performance under extreme video length scaling (up to 8 times) and excels at fine-grained frame retrieval on our proposed Needle in a Video Haystack (NIAVH) benchmark. With linear GPU memory scaling, VideoLLaMB processes up to 320 frames using a single Nvidia A100 GPU, despite being trained on only 16 frames-offering an unprecedented balance of accuracy, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This makes it highly accessible and practical for the academic community.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) emerges as a pivotal and highly promising branch in the field of computer vision. Classical closed-vocabulary MOT (CV-MOT) methods aim to track objects of predefined categories. Recently, some open-vocabulary MOT (OV-MOT) methods have successfully addressed the problem of tracking unknown categories. However, we found that the CV-MOT and OV-MOT methods each struggle to excel in the tasks of the other. In this paper, we present a unified framework, Associate Everything Detected (AED), that simultaneously tackles CV-MOT and OV-MOT by integrating with any off-the-shelf detector and supports unknown categories. Different from existing tracking-by-detection MOT methods, AED gets rid of prior knowledge (e.g. motion cues) and relies solely on highly robust feature learning to handle complex trajectories in OV-MOT tasks while keeping excellent performance in CV-MOT tasks. Specifically, we model the association task as a similarity decoding problem and propose a sim-decoder with an association-centric learning mechanism. The sim-decoder calculates similarities in three aspects: spatial, temporal, and cross-clip. Subsequently, association-centric learning leverages these threefold similarities to ensure that the extracted features are appropriate for continuous tracking and robust enough to generalize to unknown categories. Compared with existing powerful OV-MOT and CV-MOT methods, AED achieves superior performance on TAO, SportsMOT, and DanceTrack without any prior knowledge. Our code is available at https://github.com/balabooooo/AED.

Abstract: Perception systems play a crucial role in autonomous driving, incorporating multiple sensors and corresponding computer vision algorithms. 3D LiDAR sensors are widely used to capture sparse point clouds of the vehicle's surroundings. However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements, aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance for SSC, surpassing most existing methods.

Abstract: Radiologists play a crucial role in translating medical images into actionable reports. However, the field faces staffing shortages and increasing workloads. While automated approaches using vision-language models (VLMs) show promise as assistants, they require exceptionally high accuracy. Most current VLMs in radiology rely solely on supervised fine-tuning. Meanwhile, additional preference fine-tuning in the post-training pipeline has become standard practice in the general domain. The challenge in radiology lies in the prohibitive cost of obtaining radiologist feedback at scale. To address this challenge, we propose an automated pipeline for preference feedback, focusing on chest X-ray radiology report generation (RRG). Specifically, our method leverages publicly available datasets containing pairs of images and radiologist-written reference reports with reference-based metrics, or Judges, eliminating the need for additional radiologist feedback. We investigate reward overoptimization via length exploitation in this setting and introduce a length-controlled version of the GREEN score. Our best-performing setup achieves state-of-the-art CheXbert scores on the MIMIC-CXR dataset for the RRG task while on average maintaining robust performance across six additional image perception and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Animation data is often obtained through optical motion capture systems, which utilize a multitude of cameras to establish the position of optical markers. However, system errors or occlusions can result in missing markers, the manual cleaning of which can be time-consuming. This has sparked interest in machine learning-based solutions for missing marker reconstruction in the academic community. Most academic papers utilize a simplistic mean square error as the main metric. In this paper, we show that this metric does not correlate with subjective perception of the fill quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate a set of better-correlated metrics that can drive progress in the field.

Abstract: Previous methods utilize the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for panoptic lifting, while their training and rendering speed are unsatisfactory. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent technique due to its rapid training and rendering speed. However, unlike NeRF, the conventional 3DGS may not satisfy the basic smoothness assumption as it does not rely on any parameterized structures to render (e.g., MLPs). Consequently, the conventional 3DGS is, in nature, more susceptible to noisy 2D mask supervision. In this paper, we propose a new method called PLGS that enables 3DGS to generate consistent panoptic segmentation masks from noisy 2D segmentation masks while maintaining superior efficiency compared to NeRF-based methods. Specifically, we build a panoptic-aware structured 3D Gaussian model to introduce smoothness and design effective noise reduction strategies. For the semantic field, instead of initialization with structure from motion, we construct reliable semantic anchor points to initialize the 3D Gaussians. We then use these anchor points as smooth regularization during training. Additionally, we present a self-training approach using pseudo labels generated by merging the rendered masks with the noisy masks to enhance the robustness of PLGS. For the instance field, we project the 2D instance masks into 3D space and match them with oriented bounding boxes to generate cross-view consistent instance masks for supervision. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both segmentation quality and speed.

Abstract: Text logo design heavily relies on the creativity and expertise of professional designers, in which arranging element layouts is one of the most important procedures. However, this specific task has received limited attention, often overshadowed by broader layout generation tasks such as document or poster design. In this paper, we propose a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that generates content-aware text logo layouts by integrating multi-modal inputs with user-defined constraints, enabling more flexible and robust layout generation for real-world applications. We introduce two model techniques that reduce the computational cost for processing multiple glyph images simultaneously, without compromising performance. To support instruction tuning of our model, we construct two extensive text logo datasets that are five times larger than existing public datasets. In addition to geometric annotations (\textit{e.g.}, text masks and character recognition), our datasets include detailed layout descriptions in natural language, enabling the model to reason more effectively in handling complex designs and custom user inputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and datasets, outperforming existing methods on various benchmarks that assess geometric aesthetics and human preferences.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal mathematical reasoning by incorporating the notion of ``slow thinking'' into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our core idea is that models can learn to adaptively use different levels of reasoning to tackle questions of different complexity. We propose a novel paradigm of Self-structured Chain of Thought (SCoT), which comprises of minimal semantic atomic steps. Different from existing methods that rely on structured templates or free-form paradigms, our method can not only generate cognitive CoT structures for various complex tasks but also mitigates the phenomena of overthinking for easier tasks. To introduce structured reasoning into visual cognition, we further design a novel AtomThink framework with four key modules, including (i) a data engine to generate high-quality multimodal reasoning paths; (ii) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process with serialized inference data; (iii) a policy-guided multi-turn inference method; and (iv) an atomic capability metric to evaluate the single step utilization rate. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving more than 10\% average accuracy gains on MathVista and MathVerse. Compared to state-of-the-art structured CoT approaches, our method not only achieves higher accuracy but also improves data utilization by 5 times and boosts inference efficiency by 85.3\%. Our code is now public available in https://github.com/Quinn777/AtomThink.

Abstract: The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.

Abstract: The shared topology of human skeletons motivated the recent investigation of graph convolutional network (GCN) solutions for action recognition. However, most of the existing GCNs rely on the binary connection of two neighboring vertices (joints) formed by an edge (bone), overlooking the potential of constructing multi-vertex convolution structures. Although some studies have attempted to utilize hyper-graphs to represent the topology, they rely on a fixed construction strategy, which limits their adaptivity in uncovering the intricate latent relationships within the action. In this paper, we address this oversight and explore the merits of an adaptive hyper-graph convolutional network (Hyper-GCN) to achieve the aggregation of rich semantic information conveyed by skeleton vertices. In particular, our Hyper-GCN adaptively optimises the hyper-graphs during training, revealing the action-driven multi-vertex relations. Besides, virtual connections are often designed to support efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of dependencies within the skeleton. By injecting virtual connections into hyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be highlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Current human motion synthesis frameworks rely on global action descriptions, creating a modality gap that limits both motion understanding and generation capabilities. A single coarse description, such as run, fails to capture details such as variations in speed, limb positioning, and kinematic dynamics, leading to ambiguities between text and motion modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce KinMo, a unified framework built on a hierarchical describable motion representation that extends beyond global actions by incorporating kinematic group movements and their interactions. We design an automated annotation pipeline to generate high-quality, fine-grained descriptions for this decomposition, resulting in the KinMo dataset and offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution for dataset enrichment. To leverage these structured descriptions, we propose Hierarchical Text-Motion Alignment that progressively integrates additional motion details, thereby improving semantic motion understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a coarse-to-fine motion generation procedure to leverage enhanced spatial understanding to improve motion synthesis. Experimental results show that KinMo significantly improves motion understanding, demonstrated by enhanced text-motion retrieval performance and enabling more fine-grained motion generation and editing capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality images with a strong focus on realism and textual fidelity. Yet, large-scale text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, struggle to generate images where foreground objects are placed over a chroma key background, limiting their ability to separate foreground and background elements without fine-tuning. To address this limitation, we present a novel Training-Free Chroma Key Content Generation Diffusion Model (TKG-DM), which optimizes the initial random noise to produce images with foreground objects on a specifiable color background. Our proposed method is the first to explore the manipulation of the color aspects in initial noise for controlled background generation, enabling precise separation of foreground and background without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, matching or surpassing fine-tuned models. Finally, we successfully extend it to other tasks (e.g., consistency models and text-to-video), highlighting its transformative potential across various generative applications where independent control of foreground and background is crucial.

Abstract: We study $\textit{how}$ rich visual semantic information is represented within various layers and denoising timesteps of different diffusion architectures. We uncover monosemantic interpretable features by leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAE). We substantiate our mechanistic interpretations via transfer learning using light-weight classifiers on off-the-shelf diffusion models' features. On $4$ datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion features for representation learning. We provide an in-depth analysis of how different diffusion architectures, pre-training datasets, and language model conditioning impacts visual representation granularity, inductive biases, and transfer learning capabilities. Our work is a critical step towards deepening interpretability of black-box diffusion models. Code and visualizations available at: https://github.com/revelio-diffusion/revelio

Abstract: The emergence of neural rendering has significantly advanced the rendering quality of 3D human avatars, with the recently popular 3DGS technique enabling real-time performance. However, SMPL-driven 3DGS human avatars still struggle to capture fine appearance details due to the complex mapping from pose to appearance during fitting. In this paper, we propose SeqAvatar, which excavates the explicit 3DGS representation to better model human avatars based on a hierarchical motion context. Specifically, we utilize a coarse-to-fine motion conditions that incorporate both the overall human skeleton and fine-grained vertex motions for non-rigid deformation. To enhance the robustness of the proposed motion conditions, we adopt a spatio-temporal multi-scale sampling strategy to hierarchically integrate more motion clues to model human avatars. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms 3DGS-based approaches and renders human avatars orders of magnitude faster than the latest NeRF-based models that incorporate temporal context, all while delivering performance that is at least comparable or even superior.

<title>Individual Content and Motion Dynamics Preserved Pruning for Video Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to deploying Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). To overcome this, we introduce a new Video Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion dynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe that deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of \textbf{motion dynamics} (\textit{e.g.,} coherence of the entire video), while shallower layers are more focused on \textbf{individual content} (\textit{e.g.,} individual frames). Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from the shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a lightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Moreover, we propose an \textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain comparable generation performance as larger VDM to VDMini. In particular, we first use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to preserve the consistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and student models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss to enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This method significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\times$, 1.4 $\times$, and 1.25 $\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V, the T2V method T2V-Turbo-v2, and the T2V method HunyuanVideo, while maintaining the quality of the generated videos on several benchmarks including UCF101, VBench-T2V, and VBench-I2V.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated notable success in large-scale scene reconstruction, but challenges persist due to high training memory consumption and storage overhead. Hybrid representations that integrate implicit and explicit features offer a way to mitigate these limitations. However, when applied in parallelized block-wise training, two critical issues arise since reconstruction accuracy deteriorates due to reduced data diversity when training each block independently, and parallel training restricts the number of divided blocks to the available number of GPUs. To address these issues, we propose Momentum-GS, a novel approach that leverages momentum-based self-distillation to promote consistency and accuracy across the blocks while decoupling the number of blocks from the physical GPU count. Our method maintains a teacher Gaussian decoder updated with momentum, ensuring a stable reference during training. This teacher provides each block with global guidance in a self-distillation manner, promoting spatial consistency in reconstruction. To further ensure consistency across the blocks, we incorporate block weighting, dynamically adjusting each block's weight according to its reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 12.8% improvement in LPIPS over CityGaussian with much fewer divided blocks and establishing a new state of the art.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible (IR-VIS) methods inherit the general representations of Pre-trained Visual Models (PVMs) to facilitate complementary learning. However, our analysis indicates that under the full fine-tuning paradigm, the feature space becomes highly constrained and low-ranked, which has been proven to seriously impair generalization. One solution is freezing parameters to preserve pre-trained knowledge and thus maintain diversity of the feature space. To this end, we propose IV-tuning, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various IR-VIS downstream tasks, including salient object detection, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Compared with the full fine-tuning baselines and existing IR-VIS methods, IV-tuning facilitates the learning of complementary information between infrared and visible modalities with less than 3% of the backbone parameters, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem. The code is available in https://github.com/Yummy198913/IV-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce GausSim, a novel neural network-based simulator designed to capture the dynamic behaviors of real-world elastic objects represented through Gaussian kernels. We leverage continuum mechanics and treat each kernel as a Center of Mass System (CMS) that represents continuous piece of matter, accounting for realistic deformations without idealized assumptions. To improve computational efficiency and fidelity, we employ a hierarchical structure that further organizes kernels into CMSs with explicit formulations, enabling a coarse-to-fine simulation approach. This structure significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving detailed dynamics. In addition, GausSim incorporates explicit physics constraints, such as mass and momentum conservation, ensuring interpretable results and robust, physically plausible simulations. To validate our approach, we present a new dataset, READY, containing multi-view videos of real-world elastic deformations. Experimental results demonstrate that GausSim achieves superior performance compared to existing physics-driven baselines, offering a practical and accurate solution for simulating complex dynamic behaviors. Code and model are available at our project page: https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/gausim/index.html .

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has achieved remarkable success by integrating information from various modalities, achieving superior performance in tasks like recognition and retrieval compared to uni-modal approaches. However, real-world scenarios often present novel modalities that are unseen during training due to resource and privacy constraints, a challenge current methods struggle to address. This paper introduces Modality Generalization (MG), which focuses on enabling models to generalize to unseen modalities. We define two cases: Weak MG, where both seen and unseen modalities can be mapped into a joint embedding space via existing perceptors, and Strong MG, where no such mappings exist. To facilitate progress, we propose a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-modal algorithms and adapt existing methods that focus on generalization. Extensive experiments highlight the complexity of MG, exposing the limitations of existing methods and identifying key directions for future research. Our work provides a foundation for advancing robust and adaptable multi-modal models, enabling them to handle unseen modalities in realistic scenarios.

<title>Scendi Score: Prompt-Aware Diversity Evaluation via Schur Complement of CLIP Embeddings</title>

Abstract: The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the fidelity of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the alignment of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which are responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts, which we refer to as prompt-aware diversity. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the Schur Complement ENtopy DIversity (Scendi) score, as a measure of the prompt-aware diversity for prompt-guided generative models. Additionally, we discuss the application of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt on the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of the embedded vectors on specific objects. We present several numerical results that apply our proposed Scendi score to evaluate text-to-image and LLM (text-to-text) models. Our numerical results indicate the success of the Scendi score in capturing the intrinsic diversity of prompt-guided generative models. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/scendi-score.

Abstract: Balancing content fidelity and artistic style is a pivotal challenge in image generation. While traditional style transfer methods and modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) strive to achieve this balance, they often struggle to do so without sacrificing either style, content, or sometimes both. This work addresses this challenge by analyzing the ability of DDPMs to maintain content and style equilibrium. We introduce a novel method to identify sensitivities within the DDPM attention layers, identifying specific layers that correspond to different stylistic aspects. By directing conditional inputs only to these sensitive layers, our approach enables fine-grained control over style and content, significantly reducing issues arising from over-constrained inputs. Our findings demonstrate that this method enhances recent stylization techniques by better aligning style and content, ultimately improving the quality of generated visual content.

<title>From Age Estimation to Age-Invariant Face Recognition: Generalized Age Feature Extraction Using Order-Enhanced Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Generalized age feature extraction is crucial for age-related facial analysis tasks, such as age estimation and age-invariant face recognition (AIFR). Despite the recent successes of models in homogeneous-dataset experiments, their performance drops significantly in cross-dataset evaluations. Most of these models fail to extract generalized age features as they only attempt to map extracted features with training age labels directly without explicitly modeling the natural ordinal progression of aging. In this paper, we propose Order-Enhanced Contrastive Learning (OrdCon), a novel contrastive learning framework designed explicitly for ordinal attributes like age. Specifically, to extract generalized features, OrdCon aligns the direction vector of two features with either the natural aging direction or its reverse to model the ordinal process of aging. To further enhance generalizability, OrdCon leverages a novel soft proxy matching loss as a second contrastive objective, ensuring that features are positioned around the center of each age cluster with minimal intra-class variance and proportionally away from other clusters. By modeling the ageing process, the framework can enhance generalizability by improving the alignment of samples from the same class and reducing the divergence of direction vectors. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets in homogeneous-dataset evaluations for both age estimation and AIFR. In cross-dataset experiments, OrdCon outperforms other methods by reducing the mean absolute error by approximately 1.38 on average for the age estimation task and boosts the average accuracy for AIFR by 1.87%.

Abstract: Video tokenizers are essential for latent video diffusion models, converting raw video data into spatiotemporally compressed latent spaces for efficient training. However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a temporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses significant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to directly training the full model. Furthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video diffusion model for high-quality video generation with a significantly reduced token budget.

Abstract: Image tokenizers form the foundation of modern text-to-image generative models but are notoriously difficult to train. Furthermore, most existing text-to-image models rely on large-scale, high-quality private datasets, making them challenging to replicate. In this work, we introduce Text-Aware Transformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TA-TiTok), an efficient and powerful image tokenizer that can utilize either discrete or continuous 1-dimensional tokens. TA-TiTok uniquely integrates textual information during the tokenizer decoding stage (i.e., de-tokenization), accelerating convergence and enhancing performance. TA-TiTok also benefits from a simplified, yet effective, one-stage training process, eliminating the need for the complex two-stage distillation used in previous 1-dimensional tokenizers. This design allows for seamless scalability to large datasets. Building on this, we introduce a family of text-to-image Masked Generative Models (MaskGen), trained exclusively on open data while achieving comparable performance to models trained on private data. We aim to release both the efficient, strong TA-TiTok tokenizers and the open-data, open-weight MaskGen models to promote broader access and democratize the field of text-to-image masked generative models.

Abstract: Even though an Under-Display Camera (UDC) is an advanced imaging system, the display panel significantly degrades captured images or videos, introducing low transmittance, blur, noise, and flare issues. Tackling such issues is challenging because of the complex degradation of UDCs, including diverse flare patterns. However, no dataset contains videos of real-world UDC degradation. In this paper, we propose a real-world UDC video dataset called UDC-VIT. Unlike existing datasets, UDC-VIT exclusively includes human motions for facial recognition. We propose a video-capturing system to acquire clean and UDC-degraded videos of the same scene simultaneously. Then, we align a pair of captured videos frame by frame, using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We compare UDC-VIT with six representative UDC still image datasets and two existing UDC video datasets. Using six deep-learning models, we compare UDC-VIT and an existing synthetic UDC video dataset. The results indicate the ineffectiveness of models trained on earlier synthetic UDC video datasets, as they do not reflect the actual characteristics of UDC-degraded videos. We also demonstrate the importance of effective UDC restoration by evaluating face recognition accuracy concerning PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores. UDC-VIT is available at our official GitHub repository.

Abstract: Generating full-body human gestures based on speech signals remains challenges on quality and speed. Existing approaches model different body regions such as body, legs and hands separately, which fail to capture the spatial interactions between them and result in unnatural and disjointed movements. Additionally, their autoregressive/diffusion-based pipelines show slow generation speed due to dozens of inference steps. To address these two challenges, we propose GestureLSM, a flow-matching-based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. Our method i) explicitly model the interaction of tokenized body regions through spatial and temporal attention, for generating coherent full-body gestures. ii) introduce the flow matching to enable more efficient sampling by explicitly modeling the latent velocity space. To overcome the suboptimal performance of flow matching baseline, we propose latent shortcut learning and beta distribution time stamp sampling during training to enhance gesture synthesis quality and accelerate inference. Combining the spatial-temporal modeling and improved flow matching-based framework, GestureLSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BEAT2 while significantly reducing inference time compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing digital humans and embodied agents in real-world applications.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has advanced significantly, while existing methods still struggle with accurately rendering detailed body parts like hands and faces, especially in long sequences and intricate motions. Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality 3D semantic occupancy from raw sensor data remains an essential yet challenging task, often requiring extensive manual labeling. In this work, we propose AutoOcc, a vision-centric automated pipeline for open-ended semantic occupancy annotation that integrates differentiable Gaussian splatting guided by vision-language models. We formulate the open-ended semantic 3D occupancy reconstruction task to automatically generate scene occupancy by combining attention maps from vision-language models and foundation vision models. We devise semantic-aware Gaussians as intermediate geometric descriptors and propose a cumulative Gaussian-to-voxel splatting algorithm that enables effective and efficient occupancy annotation. Our framework outperforms existing automated occupancy annotation methods without human labels. AutoOcc also enables open-ended semantic occupancy auto-labeling, achieving robust performance in both static and dynamically complex scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have made text-guided image inpainting - adding, removing, or altering image regions using textual prompts - widely accessible. However, generating semantically correct photorealistic imagery, typically requires carefully-crafted prompts and iterative refinement by evaluating the realism of the generated content - tasks commonly performed by humans. To automate the generative process, we propose Semantically Aligned and Uncertainty Guided AI Image Inpainting (SAGI), a model-agnostic pipeline, to sample prompts from a distribution that closely aligns with human perception and to evaluate the generated content and discard instances that deviate from such a distribution, which we approximate using pretrained large language models and vision-language models. By applying this pipeline on multiple state-of-the-art inpainting models, we create the SAGI Dataset (SAGI-D), currently the largest and most diverse dataset of AI-generated inpaintings, comprising over 95k inpainted images and a human-evaluated subset. Our experiments show that semantic alignment significantly improves image quality and aesthetics, while uncertainty guidance effectively identifies realistic manipulations - human ability to distinguish inpainted images from real ones drops from 74% to 35% in terms of accuracy, after applying our pipeline. Moreover, using SAGI-D for training several image forensic approaches increases in-domain detection performance on average by 37.4% and out-of-domain generalization by 26.1% in terms of IoU, also demonstrating its utility in countering malicious exploitation of generative AI.

Abstract: We present a unified and generalizable framework for synthesizing view-consistent and temporally coherent avatars from a single image, addressing the challenging task of single-image avatar generation. Existing diffusion-based methods often condition on sparse human templates (e.g., depth or normal maps), which leads to multi-view and temporal inconsistencies due to the mismatch between these signals and the true appearance of the subject. Our approach bridges this gap by combining the reconstruction power of regression-based 3D human reconstruction with the generative capabilities of a diffusion model. In a first step, an initial 3D reconstructed human through a generalized NeRF provides comprehensive conditioning, ensuring high-quality synthesis faithful to the reference appearance and structure. Subsequently, the derived geometry and appearance from the generalized NeRF serve as input to a video-based diffusion model. This strategic integration is pivotal for enforcing both multi-view and temporal consistency throughout the avatar's generation. Empirical results underscore the superior generalization ability of our proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse in-domain and out-of-domain in-the-wild datasets.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is crucial for creating lifelike avatars and enhancing human-computer interactions by synchronizing gestures with speech. Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle with accurately identifying the rhythmic or semantic triggers from audio for generating contextualized gesture patterns and achieving pixel-level realism. To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Contextual Gesture not only produces realistic and speech-aligned gesture videos but also supports long-sequence generation and video gesture editing applications, shown in Fig.1.

Abstract: Neural synchrony is hypothesized to play a crucial role in how the brain organizes visual scenes into structured representations, enabling the robust encoding of multiple objects within a scene. However, current deep learning models often struggle with object binding, limiting their ability to represent multiple objects effectively. Inspired by neuroscience, we investigate whether synchrony-based mechanisms can enhance object encoding in artificial models trained for visual categorization. Specifically, we combine complex-valued representations with Kuramoto dynamics to promote phase alignment, facilitating the grouping of features belonging to the same object. We evaluate two architectures employing synchrony: a feedforward model and a recurrent model with feedback connections to refine phase synchronization using top-down information. Both models outperform their real-valued counterparts and complex-valued models without Kuramoto synchronization on tasks involving multi-object images, such as overlapping handwritten digits, noisy inputs, and out-of-distribution transformations. Our findings highlight the potential of synchrony-driven mechanisms to enhance deep learning models, improving their performance, robustness, and generalization in complex visual categorization tasks.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression at fine-grained spatial resolution, offering insights into tissue molecular landscapes. Previous methods for spatial gene expression prediction typically crop spots of interest from histopathology slide images, and train models to map each spot to a corresponding gene expression profile. However, these methods inherently lose the spatial resolution in gene expression: 1) each spot often contains multiple cells with distinct gene expression profiles; 2) spots are typically defined at fixed spatial resolutions, limiting the ability to predict gene expression at varying scales. To address these limitations, this paper presents PixNet, a dense prediction network capable of predicting spatially resolved gene expression across spots of varying sizes and scales directly from histopathology slide images. Different from previous methods that map individual spots to gene expression values, we generate a spatially dense continuous gene expression map from the histopathology slide image, and aggregate values within spots of interest to predict the gene expression. Our PixNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four common ST datasets in multiple spatial scales. The source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Infrared Small-Target Detection (IRSTD) algorithms on edge devices necessitates the exploration of model compression techniques. Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are distinguished by their exceptional efficiency in model compression. However, the small size of infrared targets introduces stringent precision requirements for the IRSTD task, while the inherent precision loss during binarization presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose the Binarized Infrared Small-Target Detection Network (BiisNet), which preserves the core operations of binarized convolutions while integrating full-precision features into the network's information flow. Specifically, we propose the Dot Binary Convolution, which retains fine-grained semantic information in feature maps while still leveraging the binarized convolution operations. In addition, we introduce a smooth and adaptive Dynamic Softsign function, which provides more comprehensive and progressively finer gradient during backpropagation, enhancing model stability and promoting an optimal weight distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that BiisNet not only significantly outperforms other binary architectures but also has strong competitiveness among state-of-the-art full-precision models.

Abstract: Accurate geometric reconstruction of deformable tissues in monocular endoscopic video remains a fundamental challenge in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. Although recent volumetric and point primitive methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian primitives have efficiently rendered surgical scenes, they still struggle with handling artifact-free tool occlusions and preserving fine anatomical details. These limitations stem from unrestricted Gaussian scaling and insufficient surface alignment constraints during reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce Surgical Gaussian Surfels (SGS), which transform anisotropic point primitives into surface-aligned elliptical splats by constraining the scale component of the Gaussian covariance matrix along the view-aligned axis. We also introduce the Fully Fused Deformation Multilayer Perceptron (FFD-MLP), a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts accurate surfel motion fields up to 5x faster than a standard MLP. This is coupled with locality constraints to handle complex tissue deformations. We use homodirectional view-space positional gradients to capture fine image details by splitting Gaussian Surfels in over-reconstructed regions. In addition, we define surface normals as the direction of the steepest density change within each Gaussian surfel primitive, enabling accurate normal estimation without requiring monocular normal priors. We evaluate our method on two in-vivo surgical datasets, where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in surface geometry, normal map quality, and rendering efficiency, while remaining competitive in real-time rendering performance. We make our code available at https://github.com/aloma85/SurgicalGaussianSurfels

Abstract: Weakly supervised monocular 3D detection, while less annotation-intensive, often struggles to capture the global context required for reliable 3D reasoning. Conventional label-efficient methods focus on object-centric features, neglecting contextual semantic relationships that are critical in complex scenes. In this work, we propose a Context-Aware Weak Supervision for Monocular 3D object detection, namely CA-W3D, to address this limitation in a two-stage training paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a pre-training stage employing Region-wise Object Contrastive Matching (ROCM), which aligns regional object embeddings derived from a trainable monocular 3D encoder and a frozen open-vocabulary 2D visual grounding model. This alignment encourages the monocular encoder to discriminate scene-specific attributes and acquire richer contextual knowledge. In the second stage, we incorporate a pseudo-label training process with a Dual-to-One Distillation (D2OD) mechanism, which effectively transfers contextual priors into the monocular encoder while preserving spatial fidelity and maintaining computational efficiency during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on the public KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing the SoTA method over all metrics, highlighting the importance of contextual-aware knowledge in weakly-supervised monocular 3D detection.

<title>RedDiffuser: Red Teaming Vision-Language Models for Toxic Continuation via Reinforced Stable Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries bypass safety mechanisms to elicit harmful outputs. In this work, we examine an insidious variant of this threat: toxic continuation. Unlike standard jailbreaks that rely solely on malicious instructions, toxic continuation arises when the model is given a malicious input alongside a partial toxic output, resulting in harmful completions. This vulnerability poses a unique challenge in multimodal settings, where even subtle image variations can disproportionately affect the model's response. To this end, we propose RedDiffuser (RedDiff), the first red teaming framework that uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune diffusion models into generating natural-looking adversarial images that induce toxic continuations. RedDiffuser integrates a greedy search procedure for selecting candidate image prompts with reinforcement fine-tuning that jointly promotes toxic output and semantic coherence. Experiments demonstrate that RedDiffuser significantly increases the toxicity rate in LLaVA outputs by 10.69% and 8.91% on the original and hold-out sets, respectively. It also exhibits strong transferability, increasing toxicity rates on Gemini by 5.1% and on LLaMA-Vision by 26.83%. These findings uncover a cross-modal toxicity amplification vulnerability in current VLM alignment, highlighting the need for robust multimodal red teaming. We will release the RedDiffuser codebase to support future research.

Abstract: Language-guided 3D scene understanding is important for advancing applications in robotics, AR/VR, and human-computer interaction, enabling models to comprehend and interact with 3D environments through natural language. While 2D vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in 2D VQA tasks, progress in the 3D domain has been significantly slower due to the complexity of 3D data and the high cost of manual annotations. In this work, we introduce SplatTalk, a novel method that uses a generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework to produce 3D tokens suitable for direct input into a pretrained LLM, enabling effective zero-shot 3D visual question answering (3D VQA) for scenes with only posed images. During experiments on multiple benchmarks, our approach outperforms both 3D models trained specifically for the task and previous 2D-LMM-based models utilizing only images (our setting), while achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art 3D LMMs that additionally utilize 3D inputs.

Abstract: Generating coherent long-form video sequences from discrete input using only text prompts is a critical task in content creation. While diffusion-based models excel at short video synthesis, long-form storytelling from text remains largely unexplored and a challenge due to challenges pertaining to temporal coherency, preserving semantic meaning and action continuity across the video. We introduce a novel AI-empowered storytelling framework to enable seamless video generation with natural action transitions and structured narratives. We first present a bidirectional time-weighted latent blending strategy to ensure temporal consistency between segments of the long-form video being generated. We then introduce a dynamics-informed prompt weighting (DIPW) mechanism that adaptively adjusts the influence of scene and action prompts at each diffusion timestep by jointly considering CLIP-based alignment, narrative continuity, and temporal smoothness. To further enhance motion continuity, we propose a semantic action representation to encode high-level action semantics into the blending process, dynamically adjusting transitions based on action similarity, ensuring smooth yet adaptable motion changes. Latent space blending maintains spatial coherence between objects in a scene, while time-weighted blending enforces bidirectional constraints for temporal consistency. The resulting integrative system prevents abrupt transitions while ensuring fluid storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, achieving temporally consistent and visually compelling video narratives without any additional training. This approach bridges the gap between short clips and extended video to establish a new paradigm in GenAI-driven video synthesis from text.

Abstract: Adversarial training significantly enhances adversarial robustness, yet superior performance is predominantly achieved on balanced datasets. Addressing adversarial robustness in the context of unbalanced or long-tailed distributions is considerably more challenging, mainly due to the scarcity of tail data instances. Previous research on adversarial robustness within long-tailed distributions has primarily focused on combining traditional long-tailed natural training with existing adversarial robustness methods.In this study, we provide an in-depth analysis for the challenge that adversarial training struggles to achieve high performance on tail classes in long-tailed distributions. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective solution to advance adversarial robustness on long-tailed distributions through a novel self-distillation technique. Specifically, this approach leverages a balanced self-teacher model, which is trained using a balanced dataset sampled from the original long-tailed dataset. Our extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both clean and robust accuracy for long-tailed adversarial robustness, with significant improvements in tail class performance on various datasets. We improve the accuracy against PGD attacks for tail classes by 20.3, 7.1, and 3.8 percentage points on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively, while achieving the highest robust accuracy.

<title>SSVQ: Unleashing the Potential of Vector Quantization with Sign-Splitting</title>

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has emerged as a prominent weight compression technique, showcasing substantially lower quantization errors than uniform quantization across diverse models, particularly in extreme compression scenarios. However, its efficacy during fine-tuning is limited by the constraint of the compression format, where weight vectors assigned to the same codeword are restricted to updates in the same direction. Consequently, many quantized weights are compelled to move in directions contrary to their local gradient information. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel VQ paradigm, Sign-Splitting VQ (SSVQ), which decouples the sign bit of weights from the codebook. Our approach involves extracting the sign bits of uncompressed weights and performing clustering and compression on all-positive weights. We then introduce latent variables for the sign bit and jointly optimize both the signs and the codebook. Additionally, we implement a progressive freezing strategy for the learnable sign to ensure training stability. Extensive experiments on various modern models and tasks demonstrate that SSVQ achieves a significantly superior compression-accuracy trade-off compared to conventional VQ. Furthermore, we validate our algorithm on a hardware accelerator, showing that SSVQ achieves a 3$\times$ speedup over the 8-bit compressed model by reducing memory access. Our code is available at https://github.com/list0830/SSVQ.

Abstract: Conventional production workflow of high-precision mesh assets necessitates a cumbersome and laborious process of manual sculpting by specialized 3D artists/modelers. The recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in AI-empowered 3D content creation for generating plausible structures and intricate appearances from images or text prompts. However, synthesizing realistic surface details still poses great challenges, and enhancing the geometry fidelity of existing lower-quality 3D meshes (instead of image/text-to-3D generation) remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce SuperCarver, a 3D geometry super-resolution pipeline for supplementing texture-consistent surface details onto a given coarse mesh. We start by rendering the original textured mesh into the image domain from multiple viewpoints. To achieve detail boosting, we construct a deterministic prior-guided normal diffusion model, which is fine-tuned on a carefully curated dataset of paired detail-lacking and detail-rich normal map renderings. To update mesh surfaces from potentially imperfect normal map predictions, we design a noise-resistant inverse rendering scheme through deformable distance field. Experiments demonstrate that our SuperCarver is capable of generating realistic and expressive surface details depicted by the actual texture appearance, making it a powerful tool to both upgrade historical low-quality 3D assets and reduce the workload of sculpting high-poly meshes.

Abstract: Humans can infer complete shapes and appearances of objects from limited visual cues, relying on extensive prior knowledge of the physical world. However, completing partially observable objects while ensuring consistency across video frames remains challenging for existing models, especially for unstructured, in-the-wild videos. This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal Completion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently throughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest. Leveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video diffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that repurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust generalization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing occlusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive fine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually advances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide range of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen datasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to various downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation, highlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable success in medical image analysis, but its reliance on large volumes of high-quality labeled data limits its applicability. While noisy labeled data are easier to obtain, directly incorporating them into training can degrade model performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Mean Teacher-based Adaptive Label Correction (ALC) self-ensemble framework for robust medical image segmentation with noisy labels. The framework leverages the Mean Teacher architecture to ensure consistent learning under noise perturbations. It includes an adaptive label refinement mechanism that dynamically captures and weights differences across multiple disturbance versions to enhance the quality of noisy labels. Additionally, a sample-level uncertainty-based label selection algorithm is introduced to prioritize high-confidence samples for network updates, mitigating the impact of noisy annotations. Consistency learning is integrated to align the predictions of the student and teacher networks, further enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in segmentation performance. By fully exploiting the strengths of the Mean Teacher structure, the ALC framework effectively processes noisy labels, adapts to challenging scenarios, and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Compact and efficient 6DoF object pose estimation is crucial in applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and space autonomous navigation systems, where lightweight models are critical for real-time accurate performance. This paper introduces a novel uncertainty-aware end-to-end Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework focused on keypoint-based 6DoF pose estimation. Keypoints predicted by a large teacher model exhibit varying levels of uncertainty that can be exploited within the distillation process to enhance the accuracy of the student model while ensuring its compactness. To this end, we propose a distillation strategy that aligns the student and teacher predictions by adjusting the knowledge transfer based on the uncertainty associated with each teacher keypoint prediction. Additionally, the proposed KD leverages this uncertainty-aware alignment of keypoints to transfer the knowledge at key locations of their respective feature maps. Experiments on the widely-used LINEMOD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving superior 6DoF object pose estimation with lightweight models compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further validation on the SPEED+ dataset for spacecraft pose estimation highlights the robustness of our approach under diverse 6DoF pose estimation scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g. CLIP, LLaVA) are trained on large-scale, lightly curated web datasets, leading them to learn unintended correlations between semantic concepts and unrelated visual signals. These associations degrade model accuracy by causing predictions to rely on incidental patterns rather than genuine visual understanding. Prior work has weaponized these correlations as an attack vector to manipulate model predictions, such as inserting a deceiving class text onto the image in a "typographic" attack. These attacks succeed due to VLMs' text-heavy bias-a result of captions that echo visible words rather than describing content. However, this attack has focused solely on text that matches the target class exactly, overlooking a broader range of correlations, including non-matching text and graphical symbols, which arise from the abundance of branding content in web-scale data. To address this gap, we introduce "artifact-based" attacks: a novel class of manipulations that mislead models using both non-matching text and graphical elements. Unlike typographic attacks, these artifacts are not predefined, making them simultaneously harder to defend against and more challenging to find. We address this by framing artifact attacks as a search problem and demonstrate their effectiveness across five datasets, with some artifacts reinforcing each other to reach 100% attack success rates. These attacks transfer across models with up to 90% effectiveness, making it possible to attack unseen models. To defend against these attacks, we extend prior work's artifact aware prompting to the graphical setting. We see a moderate reduction of success rates of up to 15% relative to standard prompts, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by satellites. Therefore, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated using Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by +6.77% on average and retrieval performance by +4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral vision-language learning. The image-caption dataset, code, and model weights are available at https://github.com/IBM/MS-CLIP.

Abstract: We formulate the motor system of an interactive avatar as a generative motion model that can drive the body to move through 3D space in a perpetual, realistic, controllable, and responsive manner. Although human motion generation has been extensively studied, many existing methods lack the responsiveness and realism of real human movements. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, we propose PRIMAL, which is learned with a two-stage paradigm. In the pretraining stage, the model learns body movements from a large number of sub-second motion segments, providing a generative foundation from which more complex motions are built. This training is fully unsupervised without annotations. Given a single-frame initial state during inference, the pretrained model not only generates unbounded, realistic, and controllable motion, but also enables the avatar to be responsive to induced impulses in real time. In the adaptation phase, we employ a novel ControlNet-like adaptor to fine-tune the base model efficiently, adapting it to new tasks such as few-shot personalized action generation and spatial target reaching. Evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We leverage the model to create a real-time character animation system in Unreal Engine that feels highly responsive and natural.

<title>StableGS: A Floater-Free Framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions are plagued by stubborn ``floater" artifacts that degrade their geometric and visual fidelity. We are the first to reveal the root cause: a fundamental conflict in the 3DGS optimization process where the opacity gradients of floaters vanish when their blended color reaches a pseudo-equilibrium of canceling errors against the background, trapping them in a spurious local minimum. To resolve this, we propose StableGS, a novel framework that decouples geometric regularization from final appearance rendering. Its core is a Dual Opacity architecture that creates two separate rendering paths: a ``Geometric Regularization Path" to bear strong depth-based constraints for structural correctness, and an ``Appearance Refinement Path" to generate high-fidelity details upon this stable foundation. We complement this with a synergistic set of geometric constraints: a self-supervised depth consistency loss and an external geometric prior enabled by our efficient global scale optimization algorithm. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show StableGS not only eliminates floaters but also resolves the common blur-artifact trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art geometric accuracy and visual quality.

Abstract: Sketch animation, which brings static sketches to life by generating dynamic video sequences, has found widespread applications in GIF design, cartoon production, and daily entertainment. While current methods for sketch animation perform well in single-object sketch animation, they struggle in multi-object scenarios. By analyzing their failures, we identify two major challenges of transitioning from single-object to multi-object sketch animation: object-aware motion modeling and complex motion optimization. For multi-object sketch animation, we propose MoSketch based on iterative optimization through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and thus animating a multi-object sketch in a training-data free manner. To tackle the two challenges in a divide-and-conquer strategy, MoSketch has four novel modules, i.e., LLM-based scene decomposition, LLM-based motion planning, multi-grained motion refinement, and compositional SDS. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing sketch animation approaches. MoSketch takes a pioneering step towards multi-object sketch animation, opening new avenues for future research and applications.

Abstract: Traditional open-access datasets focusing on surgical procedures are often limited by their small size, typically consisting of fewer than 100 videos and less than 30 hours of footage, which leads to poor model generalization. To address this constraint, a new dataset called LEMON has been compiled using a novel aggregation pipeline that collects high-resolution videos from online sources. Featuring an extensive collection of over 4K surgical videos totaling 938 hours (85 million frames) of high-quality footage across multiple procedure types, LEMON offers a comprehensive resource surpassing existing alternatives in size and scope, including two novel downstream tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this diverse dataset, we introduce LemonFM, a foundation model pretrained on LEMON using a novel self-supervised augmented knowledge distillation approach. LemonFM consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models across four downstream tasks and six datasets, achieving significant gains in surgical phase recognition (+9.5pp, +9.4pp, and +8.4pp of Jaccard in AutoLaparo, M2CAI16, and Cholec80), surgical action recognition (+4.4pp of mAP in CholecT50), surgical tool presence detection (+5.3pp and +10.2pp of mAP in Cholec80 and GraSP), and surgical semantic segmentation (+8.3pp of mDice in CholecSeg8k). LEMON and LemonFM will serve as foundational resources for the research community and industry, accelerating progress in developing autonomous robotic surgery systems and ultimately contributing to safer and more accessible surgical care worldwide.

<title>Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution</title>

Abstract: High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, PS3 and VILA-HD outperform previous vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP2 and Perception Encoder) and MLLMs (e.g., NVILA and Qwen2.5-VL) respectively across multiple benchmarks and achieve better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 16.1% improvement over GPT-4o and a 7.5% improvement and 1.67x speedup over Qwen2.5-VL.

Abstract: The differences between images belonging to fine-grained categories are often subtle and highly localized, and existing explainability techniques for deep learning models are often too diffuse to provide useful and interpretable explanations. We propose a new explainability method (PAIR-X) that leverages both intermediate model activations and backpropagated relevance scores to generate fine-grained, highly-localized pairwise visual explanations. We use animal and building re-identification (re-ID) as a primary case study of our method, and we demonstrate qualitatively improved results over a diverse set of explainability baselines on 35 public re-ID datasets. In interviews, animal re-ID experts found PAIR-X to be a meaningful improvement over existing baselines for deep model explainability, and suggested that its visualizations would be directly applicable to their work. We also propose a novel quantitative evaluation metric for our method, and demonstrate that PAIR-X visualizations appear more plausible for correct image matches than incorrect ones even when the model similarity score for the pairs is the same. By improving interpretability, PAIR-X enables humans to better distinguish correct and incorrect matches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/pairx-explains/pairx

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/JarvisUSTC/DiffPure-RobustVLM.

<title>Efficient Autoregressive Shape Generation via Octree-Based Adaptive Tokenization</title>

Abstract: Many 3D generative models rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to learn compact shape representations. However, existing methods encode all shapes into a fixed-size token, disregarding the inherent variations in scale and complexity across 3D data. This leads to inefficient latent representations that can compromise downstream generation. We address this challenge by introducing Octree-based Adaptive Tokenization, a novel framework that adjusts the dimension of latent representations according to shape complexity. Our approach constructs an adaptive octree structure guided by a quadric-error-based subdivision criterion and allocates a shape latent vector to each octree cell using a query-based transformer. Building upon this tokenization, we develop an octree-based autoregressive generative model that effectively leverages these variable-sized representations in shape generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces token counts by 50% compared to fixed-size methods while maintaining comparable visual quality. When using a similar token length, our method produces significantly higher-quality shapes. When incorporated with our downstream generative model, our method creates more detailed and diverse 3D content than existing approaches.

Abstract: Building general-purpose models that can effectively perceive the world through multimodal signals has been a long-standing goal. Current approaches involve integrating separately pre-trained components, such as connecting vision encoders to LLMs and continuing multimodal training. While such approaches exhibit remarkable sample efficiency, it remains an open question whether such late-fusion architectures are inherently superior. In this work, we revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)-those trained from the ground up on all modalities-and conduct an extensive scaling laws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and training mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to late-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image encoders or tokenizers. On the contrary, early-fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower parameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy. Motivated by the strong performance of the early-fusion architectures, we show that incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoEs) allows models to learn modality-specific weights, significantly benefiting performance.

Abstract: Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints. While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.

Abstract: Reconstructing transparent surfaces is essential for tasks such as robotic manipulation in labs, yet it poses a significant challenge for 3D reconstruction techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). These methods often encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of photorealistic rendering through standard $\alpha$-blending undermines geometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for transparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface Gaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning from appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on geometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces. In the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular modeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric accuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth extraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\alpha$-blending weights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust weighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task under realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex transparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that TSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of transparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework. Specifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a 37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score compared to the top baseline. The code and dataset are available at https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TSGS/.

Abstract: Currently, industrial anomaly detection suffers from two bottlenecks: (i) the rarity of real-world defect images and (ii) the opacity of sample quality when synthetic data are used. Existing synthetic strategies (e.g., cut-and-paste) overlook the underlying physical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies that hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this paper, we introduce a novel and lightweight pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through Math-Phys model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and employs a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality Estimator (SQE). By combining physical modeling of the three most typical physics-driven defect mechanisms: Fracture Line (FL), Pitting Loss (PL), and Plastic Warpage (PW), our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently enhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency to achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage (npcF++) further improves local fidelity. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that high-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To validate our method, we conduct experiments on three anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD. Across these datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in both image- and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of our MaPhC2F dataset and BiSQAD method. All code will be released.

Abstract: Efficiently transferring Learned Image Compression (LIC) model from human perception to machine perception is an emerging challenge in vision-centric representation learning. Existing approaches typically adapt LIC to downstream tasks in a single-task manner, which is inefficient, lacks task interaction, and results in multiple task-specific bitstreams. In this paper, we propose a multi-task adaptation framework that enables transferring a pre-trained base codec to multiple machine vision tasks through a unified model and a single training process. To achieve this, we design an asymmetric adaptation architecture consisting of a task-agnostic encoder adaptation and task-specific decoder adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce two feature propagation modules to facilitate inter-task and inter-scale feature represenation learning. Experiments on PASCAL-Context and NYUD-V2 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms both Fully Fine-Tuned and other Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuned (PEFT) baselines. Code will be released.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.

Abstract: Personalized image generation has emerged as a promising direction in multimodal content creation. It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.
  To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.

Abstract: Audiovisual emotion recognition (AVER) aims to infer human emotions from nonverbal visual-audio (VA) cues, offering modality-complementary and language-agnostic advantages. However, AVER remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of emotional expressions, cross-modal expressive disparities, and the scarcity of reliably annotated data. Recent self-supervised AVER approaches have introduced strong multimodal representations, yet they predominantly rely on modality-specific encoders and coarse content-level alignment, limiting fine-grained emotional semantic modeling. To address these issues, we propose VAEmo, an efficient two-stage framework for emotion-centric joint VA representation learning with external knowledge injection. In Stage~1, a unified and lightweight representation network is pre-trained on large-scale speaker-centric VA corpora via masked reconstruction and contrastive objectives, mitigating the modality gap and learning expressive, complementary representations without emotion labels. In Stage~2, multimodal large language models automatically generate detailed affective descriptions according to our well-designed chain-of-thought prompting for only a small subset of VA samples; these rich textual semantics are then injected by aligning their corresponding embeddings with VA representations through dual-path contrastive learning, further bridging the emotion gap.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative models-particularly diffusion models and rectified flows-have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReels-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released.

Abstract: Compact models can be effectively trained through Knowledge Distillation (KD), a technique that transfers knowledge from larger, high-performing teacher models. Two key challenges in Knowledge Distillation (KD) are: 1) balancing learning from the teacher's guidance and the task objective, and 2) handling the disparity in knowledge representation between teacher and student models. To address these, we propose Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation (MoKD). MoKD tackles two main gradient issues: a) Gradient Conflicts, where task-specific and distillation gradients are misaligned, and b) Gradient Dominance, where one objective's gradient dominates, causing imbalance. MoKD reformulates KD as a multi-objective optimization problem, enabling better balance between objectives. Additionally, it introduces a subspace learning framework to project feature representations into a high-dimensional space, improving knowledge transfer. Our MoKD is demonstrated to outperform existing methods through extensive experiments on image classification using the ImageNet-1K dataset and object detection using the COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, MoKD models also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to models trained from scratch.

Abstract: System2 reasoning is developing rapidly these days with the emergence of Deep- Thinking Models and chain-of-thought technology, which has become a centralized discussion point in the AI community. However, there is a relative gap in the research on complex video reasoning at present. In this work, we propose CoT-Vid, a novel training-free paradigm for the video domain with a multistage complex reasoning design. Distinguishing from existing video LLMs, which rely heavily on perceptual abilities, it achieved surprising performance gain with explicit reasoning mechanism. The paradigm consists of three main components: dynamic inference path routing, problem decoupling strategy, and video self-consistency verification. In addition, we propose a new standard for categorization of video questions. CoT- Vid showed outstanding results on a wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema and 5.6% on VideoEspresso, rivalling or even surpassing larger and proprietary models, such as GPT-4V, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-flash. Our codebase will be publicly available soon.

Abstract: Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models. Code will be available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo.

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

<title>Action2Dialogue: Generating Character-Centric Narratives from Scene-Level Prompts</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior. While a story generation model such as Text2Story produces the corresponding visual scene, we focus on generating expressive, character-consistent utterances grounded in both the prompts and the scene image. A pretrained vision-language encoder extracts high-level semantic features from a representative frame, capturing salient visual context. These features are then integrated with structured prompts to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural dialogue. To ensure contextual and emotional consistency across scenes, we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank -- a speaker-aware, temporally structured memory that recursively accumulates each character's dialogue history. Inspired by Script Theory in cognitive psychology, this design enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals, social context, and narrative roles throughout the story. Finally, we render each utterance as expressive, character-conditioned speech, resulting in fully-voiced, multimodal video narratives. Our training-free framework generalizes across diverse story settings -- from fantasy adventures to slice-of-life episodes -- offering a scalable solution for coherent, character-grounded audiovisual storytelling.

Abstract: 1) Biological collections house millions of specimens with digital images increasingly available through open-access platforms. However, most imaging protocols were developed for human interpretation without considering automated analysis requirements. As computer vision applications revolutionize taxonomic identification and trait extraction, a critical gap exists between current digitization practices and computational analysis needs. This review provides the first comprehensive practical framework for optimizing biological specimen imaging for computer vision applications. 2) Through interdisciplinary collaboration between taxonomists, collection managers, ecologists, and computer scientists, we synthesized evidence-based recommendations addressing fundamental computer vision concepts and practical imaging considerations. We provide immediately actionable implementation guidance while identifying critical areas requiring community standards development. 3) Our framework encompasses ten interconnected considerations for optimizing image capture for computer vision-powered taxonomic identification and trait extraction. We translate these into practical implementation checklists, equipment selection guidelines, and a roadmap for community standards development including filename conventions, pixel density requirements, and cross-institutional protocols. 4)By bridging biological and computational disciplines, this approach unlocks automated analysis potential for millions of existing specimens and guides future digitization efforts toward unprecedented analytical capabilities.

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive. However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores, introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of perceptual realness assessment.

<title>UltraVSR: Achieving Ultra-Realistic Video Super-Resolution with Efficient One-Step Diffusion Space</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. Previous methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by incorporating motion information and temporal layers. However, unreliable motion estimation from low-resolution videos and costly multiple sampling steps with deep temporal layers limit them to short sequences. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporally-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Reconstruction Scheduling (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms the iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, including an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, it enables effective propagation, fusion, and alignment across frames without explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporally coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step. Code is available at https://github.com/yongliuy/UltraVSR.

Abstract: Livestreaming often involves interactions between streamers and objects, which is critical for understanding and regulating web content. While human-object interaction (HOI) detection has made some progress in general-purpose video downstream tasks, when applied to recognize the interaction behaviors between a streamer and different objects in livestreaming, it tends to focuses too much on the objects and neglects their interactions with the streamer, which leads to object bias. To solve this issue, we propose a prototype embedding optimization for human-object interaction detection (PeO-HOI). First, the livestreaming is preprocessed using object detection and tracking techniques to extract features of the human-object (HO) pairs. Then, prototype embedding optimization is adopted to mitigate the effect of object bias on HOI. Finally, after modelling the spatio-temporal context between HO pairs, the HOI detection results are obtained by the prediction head. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed PeO-HOI method has detection accuracies of 37.19%@full, 51.42%@non-rare, 26.20%@rare on the publicly available dataset VidHOI, 45.13%@full, 62.78%@non-rare and 30.37%@rare on the self-built dataset BJUT-HOI, which effectively improves the HOI detection performance in livestreaming.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) typically pair a modestly sized vision encoder with a large language model (LLM), e.g., Llama-70B, making the decoder the primary computational burden during training. To reduce costs, a potential promising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language model before transferring it to the large one. We construct small "surrogate models" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the large target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders trained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model, a process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the full-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair and, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with the target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall VLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder. The code is at https://github.com/facebookresearch/zero.

Abstract: Accurate 3D fruit counting in orchards is challenging due to heavy occlusion, semantic ambiguity between fruits and surrounding structures, and the high computational cost of volumetric reconstruction. Existing pipelines often rely on multi-view 2D segmentation and dense volumetric sampling, which lead to accumulated fusion errors and slow inference. We introduce FruitLangGS, a language-guided 3D fruit counting framework that reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization, enabling scalable 3D representation. During inference, compressed CLIP-aligned semantic vectors embedded in each Gaussian are filtered via a dual-threshold cosine similarity mechanism, retrieving Gaussians relevant to target prompts while suppressing common distractors (e.g., foliage), without requiring retraining or image-space masks. The selected Gaussians are then sampled into dense point clouds and clustered geometrically to estimate fruit instances, remaining robust under severe occlusion and viewpoint variation. Experiments on nine different orchard-scale datasets demonstrate that FruitLangGS consistently outperforms existing pipelines in instance counting recall, avoiding multi-view segmentation fusion errors and achieving up to 99.2\% recall on Fuji-SfM orchard dataset. Ablation studies further confirm that language-conditioned semantic embedding and dual-threshold prompt filtering are essential for suppressing distractors and improving counting accuracy under heavy occlusion. Beyond fruit counting, the same framework enables prompt-driven 3D semantic retrieval without retraining, highlighting the potential of language-guided 3D perception for scalable agricultural scene understanding.

Abstract: With the growing application of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has become essential for tasks such as crop health monitoring and pest detection. However, significant domain shifts caused by environmental variations, different crop types, and diverse data acquisition methods hinder model generalization across regions, seasons, and complex agricultural settings. This paper investigates how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges by improving cross-domain transferability in agricultural image analysis. Given the limited availability of labeled data, weak model adaptability, and dynamic field conditions, DA has emerged as a promising solution. The review systematically summarizes recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, focusing on applications such as crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, where DA methods have improved performance in diverse domains. DA approaches are categorized into shallow and deep learning methods, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised strategies, with particular attention to adversarial learning-based techniques that have demonstrated strong potential in complex scenarios. In addition,the paper reviews key public agricultural image datasets, evaluating their strengths and limitations in DA research. In general, this work offers a comprehensive framework and critical insights to guide future research and development of domain adaptation in agricultural vision tasks.

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates, propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train jointly on optical flow datasets and point tracking datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe, making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are available at https://alltracker.github.io

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery. However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises 1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms, ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition, with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of architectural culture.

Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions. Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes, establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors. Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05). High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity. It comprises 960 long videos (with an average duration of 1.6 hours), along with 8,243 human-labeled multi-step question-answering pairs and 25,106 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 19 VLMs on VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: The challenge in WiFi-based cross-domain Behavior Recognition lies in the significant interference of domain-specific signals on gesture variation. However, previous methods alleviate this interference by mapping the phase from multiple domains into a common feature space. If the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) signal is used to dynamically supplement the phase features to achieve better generalization, enabling model to not only explore a wider feature space but also avoid potential degradation of gesture semantic information. Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR}, which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations, while extracting spatial features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features, and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavior characteristics. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets (Widar3.0 and XRF55) demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status, thereby potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes and shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement, where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes) unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, and Asian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background) during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes, thereby maintaining the original model's output distribution and generative capacity.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. We re-examined the DETR-inspired detection head and found substantial redundancy in its self-attention module. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header inspired by human visual perception: when observing an object, we always concentrate on one site, perceive the surrounding environment, and glance around the object. This mechanism enables each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature dimensions and scale information from different patterns. CSDN provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-trained weights can significantly improve the detection accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios, inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9 hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and effective solution for improving dense representations.

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume. Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing: single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points) for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes, texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts at boundaries of target regions due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

<title>Rethinking Visual Token Reduction in LVLMs under Cross-modal Misalignment</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to or within the large language models (LLMs). However, most in-LLM reduction approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy, we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent improvements over existing approaches, despite requiring no additional training or complex modifications. Notably, when integrated with LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VisionDrop achieves a 2.7x reduction in inference latency and 6x in FLOPs, while retaining 95.71% of the original performance.

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot video classification for extremely fine-grained actions (e.g., Windmill Dunk in basketball), where no video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen classes. While image-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition, they lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose ActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video classification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization strength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language model (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with video frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions across multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer parameters. Our approach is model-agnostic and domain-general, demonstrating that structured language priors combined with classical alignment methods can unlock the open-set recognition potential of image-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of a subjective camera to reconstruct meaningful moments that physical cameras fail to capture. We propose Subjective Camera 0.1, a framework for reconstructing real-world scenes from readily accessible subjective readouts, i.e., textual descriptions and progressively drawn rough sketches. Built on optimization-based alignment of diffusion models, our approach avoids large-scale paired training data and mitigates generalization issues. To address the challenge of integrating multiple abstract concepts in real-world scenarios, we design a Sequence-Aware Sketch-Guided Diffusion framework with three loss terms for concept-wise sequential optimization, following the natural order of subjective readouts. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality as well as spatial and semantic alignment with target scenes. User studies with 40 participants further confirm that our approach is consistently preferred.Our project page is at: subjective-camera.github.io

Abstract: Personalization, while extensively studied in conventional autonomous driving pipelines, has been largely overlooked in the context of end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), despite its critical role in fostering user trust, safety perception, and real-world adoption. A primary bottleneck is the absence of large-scale real-world datasets that systematically capture driving preferences, severely limiting the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale real-world dataset explicitly curated for personalized E2EAD, integrating comprehensive scene topology with rich dynamic context derived from agent dynamics and semantics inferred via a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines behavioral analysis, rule-and-distribution-based heuristics, and subjective semantic modeling guided by VLM reasoning, with final refinement through human-in-the-loop verification. Building upon this dataset, we introduce the first standardized benchmark for systematically evaluating personalized E2EAD models. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art architectures demonstrate that incorporating personalized driving preferences significantly improves behavioral alignment with human demonstrations.

Abstract: As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and countermeasures.

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result, these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene, i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Recent work on human animation usually incorporates large-scale video models, thereby achieving more vivid performance. However, the practical use of such methods is hindered by the slow inference speed and high computational demands. Moreover, traditional work typically employs separate models for each animation task, increasing costs in multi-task scenarios and worsening the dilemma. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoMimicV3, an efficient framework that unifies multi-task and multi-modal human animation. At the core of EchoMimicV3 lies a threefold design: a Soup-of-Tasks paradigm, a Soup-of-Modals paradigm, and a novel training and inference strategy. The Soup-of-Tasks leverages multi-task mask inputs and a counter-intuitive task allocation strategy to achieve multi-task gains without multi-model pains. Meanwhile, the Soup-of-Modals introduces a Coupled-Decoupled Multi-Modal Cross Attention module to inject multi-modal conditions, complemented by a Multi-Modal Timestep Phase-aware Dynamical Allocation mechanism to modulate multi-modal mixtures. Besides, we propose Negative Direct Preference Optimization, Phase-aware Negative Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), and Long Video CFG, which ensure stable training and inference. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that EchoMimicV3, with a minimal model size of 1.3 billion parameters, achieves competitive performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. We are committed to open-sourcing our code for community use.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation, and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA), supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and 0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/hieuphamha19/CSDS.

Abstract: The problem of generating a perpetual dynamic scene from a single view is an important problem with widespread applications in augmented and virtual reality, and robotics. However, since dynamic scenes regularly change over time, a key challenge is to ensure that different generated views be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. Prior work learns such consistency by training on multiple views, but the generated scene regions often interpolate between training views and fail to generate perpetual views. To address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager, which reformulates dynamic scene generation as a scene outpainting problem with new dynamic content. As 2D outpainting models struggle at generating 3D consistent motions from a single 2D view, we enrich 2D pixels with information from their 3D rays that facilitates learning of 3D motion consistency. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to a dynamic point cloud using the estimated video depths. We then render a partial video of the point cloud from a novel view and outpaint the missing regions using ray information (e.g., the distance from a ray to the point cloud) to generate 3D consistent motions. Next, we use the outpainted video to update the point cloud, which is used for outpainting the scene from future novel views. Moreover, we can control the generated content with the input text prompt. Experiments show that our model can generate perpetual scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras.

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation, and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes, and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

<title>$I^{2}$-World: Intra-Inter Tokenization for Efficient Dynamic 4D Scene Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key observation: the energy of predicted noisy samples in the reverse process continuously declines compared to perturbed samples in the forward process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and high-frequency subbands; 2) The subband energy of reverse-process reconstructed samples is consistently lower than that of forward-process ones, and both are lower than the original data samples. Based on the first finding, we introduce a dynamic frequency regulation mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we derive the rigorous mathematical form of exposure bias. It is worth noting that, our method is training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality of various diffusion models and frameworks with negligible computational cost.

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling, particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements. Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

While traditional methods rely on visual data, issues like poor lighting, occlusion, and suboptimal angles often hinder performance. To address these challenges, we introduce WhoFi, a novel pipeline that utilizes Wi-Fi signals for person re-identification. Biometric features are extracted from Channel State Information (CSI) and processed through a modular Deep Neural Network (DNN) featuring a Transformer-based encoder. The network is trained using an in-batch negative loss function to learn robust and generalizable biometric signatures. Experiments on the NTU-Fi dataset show that our approach achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its effectiveness in identifying individuals via Wi-Fi signals.

Abstract: Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset. Polymorph is open source at https://github.com/inference-serving/polymorph/.

Abstract: Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights. These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes. Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

Abstract: Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations. The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments. Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However, the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor, which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical properties throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space. Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness in both phases to form a learnable 3D shape context facilitated with point-wise, point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and learning-based sampling/upsampling/recovery algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling and recovery methods.

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes. It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for scalable auto-labeling. Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/

Abstract: In high-energy physics, anti-neutrons ($\bar{n}$) are fundamental particles that frequently appear as final-state particles, and the reconstruction of their kinematic properties provides an important probe for understanding the governing principles. However, this confronts significant challenges instrumentally with the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), a typical experimental sensor but recovering the information of incident $\bar{n}$ insufficiently. In this study, we introduce Vision Calorimeter (ViC), a baseline method for anti-neutron reconstruction that leverages deep learning detectors to analyze the implicit relationships between EMC responses and incident $\bar{n}$ characteristics. Our motivation lies in that energy distributions of $\bar{n}$ samples deposited in the EMC cell arrays embody rich contextual information. Converted to 2-D images, such contextual energy distributions can be used to predict the status of $\bar{n}$ ($i.e.$, incident position and momentum) through a deep learning detector along with pseudo bounding boxes and a specified training objective. Experimental results demonstrate that ViC substantially outperforms the conventional reconstruction approach, reducing the prediction error of incident position by 42.81% (from 17.31$^{\circ}$ to 9.90$^{\circ}$). More importantly, this study for the first time realizes the measurement of incident $\bar{n}$ momentum, underscoring the potential of deep learning detectors for particle reconstruction.

Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, similar to ultrasound, with wide-ranging medical applications. Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images for ring array PACT systems. To solve this semi-blind inverse problem, we parametrize the SOS using either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF) and update it directly by backpropagating the gradients through a differentiable imaging forward model. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in vivo data. Our code and synthetic numerical phantoms are available on our project page: https://lukeli0425.github.io/Coord-SoS-PACT/.

Abstract: To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. However, existing research often neglects visual content beyond memes, and in addition lacks methods to compare topic models across modalities. Our study addresses these gaps by applying multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. We use BERTopic with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data in a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories. Through this dataset, we provide insights into unimodal and multimodal topic models by analyzing symmetry and intersections of topics across modalities. We demonstrate the variety of textual and visual content shared in the channels discovered through the topic modeling, and propose a conceptual framework for the analysis of textual and visual discursive strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories. We apply the framework in a case study of the topic group Israel Gaza.

Abstract: Efficient acquisition of real-world embodied data has been increasingly critical. However, large-scale demonstrations captured by remote operation tend to take extremely high costs and fail to scale up the data size in an efficient manner. Sampling the episodes under a simulated environment is a promising way for large-scale collection while existing simulators fail to high-fidelity modeling on texture and physics. To address these limitations, we introduce the RoboGSim, a real2sim2real robotic simulator, powered by 3D Gaussian Splatting and the physics engine. RoboGSim mainly includes four parts: Gaussian Reconstructor, Digital Twins Builder, Scene Composer, and Interactive Engine. It can synthesize the simulated data with novel views, objects, trajectories, and scenes. RoboGSim also provides an online, reproducible, and safe evaluation for different manipulation policies. The real2sim and sim2real transfer experiments show a high consistency in the texture and physics. We compared the test results of RoboGSim data and real robot data on both RoboGSim and real robot platforms. The experimental results show that the RoboGSim data model can achieve zero-shot performance on the real robot, with results comparable to real robot data. Additionally, in experiments with novel perspectives and novel scenes, the RoboGSim data model performed even better on the real robot than the real robot data model. This not only helps reduce the sim2real gap but also addresses the limitations of real robot data collection, such as its single-source and high cost. We hope RoboGSim serves as a closed-loop simulator for fair comparison on policy learning. More information can be found on our project page https://robogsim.github.io/.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of brain tumors in intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) images could facilitate localization of tumor tissue during resection surgery. The lack of large annotated datasets limits the current models performances. In this paper, we investigated the use of tumor annotations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are more accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated MRI scans with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training the nnU-Net model with different configurations of the data and label origins. The results showed no significant difference in Dice score for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors compared to models trained with only iUS annotations and both, and to expert annotations, indicating that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for iUS tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in iUS images. The best model obtained an average Dice score of $0.62\pm0.31$, compared to $0.67\pm0.25$ for an expert neurosurgeon, where the performance on larger tumors were similar, but lower for the models on smaller tumors. In addition, the results showed that removing smaller tumors from the training sets improved the results.

<title>3D-CDRGP: Towards Cross-Device Robotic Grasping Policy in 3D Open World</title>

Abstract: Given the diversity of devices and the product upgrades, cross-device research has become an urgent issue that needs to be tackled. To this end, we pioneer in probing the cross-device (cameras & robotics) grasping policy in the 3D open world. Specifically, we construct two real-world grasping setups, employing robotic arms and cameras from completely different manufacturers. To minimize domain differences in point clouds from diverse cameras, we adopt clustering methods to generate 3D object proposals. However, existing clustering methods are limited to closed-set scenarios, which confines the robotic graspable object categories and ossifies the deployment scenarios. To extend these methods to open-world settings, we introduce the SSGC-Seg module that enables category-agnostic 3D object detection. The proposed module transforms the original multi-class semantic information into binary semantic cues-foreground and background by analyzing the SoftMax value of each point, and then clusters the foreground points based on geometric information to form initial object proposals. Furthermore, ScoreNet{\ddag} is designed to score each detection result, and the robotic arm prioritizes grasping the object with the highest confidence score. Experiments on two different types of setups highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our policy for cross-device robotics grasping research. Our code is provided in the supplementary and will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), a central challenge is distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural images. Despite the impressive capabilities of advanced AI generative models in producing visually compelling content, significant discrepancies remain when compared to natural images. To systematically investigate and quantify these differences, we construct a large-scale multimodal dataset named DANI, comprising 5,000 natural images and over 440,000 AI-generated image (AIGI) samples produced by nine representative models using both unimodal and multimodal prompts, including Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text and Image-to-Image (TI2I). We then introduce D-Judge, a benchmark designed to answer the critical question: how far are AI-generated images from truly realistic images? Our fine-grained evaluation framework assesses DANI across five key dimensions: naive visual quality, semantic alignment, aesthetic appeal, downstream task applicability, and coordinated human validation. Extensive experiments reveal substantial discrepancies across these dimensions, highlighting the importance of aligning quantitative metrics with human judgment to achieve a comprehensive understanding of AI-generated image quality. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/ryliu68/DJudge and https://huggingface.co/datasets/Renyang/DANI.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-powered Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.

<title>A novel approach to navigate the taxonomic hierarchy to address the Open-World Scenarios in Medicinal Plant Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17289</link>

Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel approach for plant hierarchical taxonomy classification by posing the problem as an open class problem. It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed model size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods making it easily deploy able in real world application.

<title>Style Content Decomposition-based Data Augmentation for Domain Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20619</link>

arXiv:2502.20619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to domain shifts across diverse medical imaging modalities, learned segmentation models often suffer significant performance degradation during deployment. These domain shifts, typically caused by variations in imaging systems, generally comprise two principal components: 1) \textbf{"style" shifts}, referring to global disparities in image properties such as illumination, contrast, and color; and 2) \textbf{"content" shifts}, which involve local discrepancies in anatomical structures. To address domain shifts in medical image segmentation, a core challenge arises: how can we decouple the factors within images that determine their "style" and "content" components? To this end, we first propose a linear style-content decomposition method that factorizes an image into style codes and content maps, explicitly modeling the "style" and "content" components. Building on this, we introduce a \textbf{Sty}le-\textbf{Con}tent decomposition-based data \textbf{a}ugmentation algorithm (StyCona), which leverages this decomposition strategy to guide augmentation of both the global style and local content of source-domain images, enabling the training of a well-generalized model for domain-generalizable medical image segmentation. StyCona is a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that substantially improves model generalization without requiring additional training parameters or modifications to segmentation model architectures. Experiments on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and fundus photography segmentation tasks, with single and multiple target domains respectively, demonstrate the effectiveness of StyCona and its superiority over state-of-the-art domain generalization methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/Senyh/StyCona.

Abstract: We explore how scalable robot data can address real-world challenges for generalized robotic manipulation. Introducing AgiBot World, a large-scale platform comprising over 1 million trajectories across 217 tasks in five deployment scenarios, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in data scale compared to existing datasets. Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution. It is extensible from grippers to dexterous hands and visuo-tactile sensors for fine-grained skill acquisition. Building on top of data, we introduce Genie Operator-1 (GO-1), a novel generalist policy that leverages latent action representations to maximize data utilization, demonstrating predictable performance scaling with increased data volume. Policies pre-trained on our dataset achieve an average performance improvement of 30% over those trained on Open X-Embodiment, both in in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. GO-1 exhibits exceptional capability in real-world dexterous and long-horizon tasks, achieving over 60% success rate on complex tasks and outperforming prior RDT approach by 32%. By open-sourcing the dataset, tools, and models, we aim to democratize access to large-scale, high-quality robot data, advancing the pursuit of scalable and general-purpose intelligence.

<title>SEAL: Semantic Aware Image Watermarking</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.12172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have rapidly evolved to generate realistic outputs. However, their synthetic outputs increasingly challenge the clear distinction between natural and AI-generated content, necessitating robust watermarking techniques. Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the target image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication onto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent watermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise. Yet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely on searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection.
  In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic information about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a distortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of key patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic embedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore, conditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves robustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two largely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial noise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker inserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image, possibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's increased robustness to these attacks. Taken together, our results suggest that content-aware watermarks can mitigate risks arising from image-generative models.

<title>Dynamic-Dark SLAM: RGB-Thermal Cooperative Robot Vision Strategy for Multi-Person Tracking in Both Well-Lit and Low-Light Scenes</title>

Abstract: In robot vision, thermal cameras hold great potential for recognizing humans even in complete darkness. However, their application to multi-person tracking (MPT) has been limited due to data scarcity and the inherent difficulty of distinguishing individuals. In this study, we propose a cooperative MPT system that utilizes co-located RGB and thermal cameras, where pseudo-annotations (bounding boxes and person IDs) are used to train both RGB and thermal trackers. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the thermal tracker performs robustly in both bright and dark environments. Moreover, the results suggest that a tracker-switching strategy -- guided by a binary brightness classifier -- is more effective for information integration than a tracker-fusion approach. As an application example, we present an image change pattern recognition (ICPR) method, the ``human-as-landmark,'' which combines two key properties: the thermal recognizability of humans in dark environments and the rich landmark characteristics -- appearance, geometry, and semantics -- of static objects (occluders). Whereas conventional SLAM focuses on mapping static landmarks in well-lit environments, the present study takes a first step toward a new Human-Only SLAM paradigm, ``Dynamic-Dark SLAM,'' which aims to map even dynamic landmarks in complete darkness. Additionally, this study demonstrates that knowledge transfer between thermal and depth modalities enables reliable person tracking using low-resolution 3D LiDAR data without RGB input, contributing an important advance toward cross-robot SLAM systems.

Abstract: Recent studies generally enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities via supervised fine-tuning on high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning data, which often leads models to merely imitate successful reasoning paths without understanding what the wrong reasoning paths are. In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.

Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology has recently achieved photorealistic mapping capabilities thanks to the real-time, high-fidelity rendering enabled by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, due to the static representation of scenes, current 3DGS-based SLAM encounters issues with pose drift and failure to reconstruct accurate maps in dynamic environments. To address this problem, we present D4DGS-SLAM, the first SLAM method based on 4DGS map representation for dynamic environments. By incorporating the temporal dimension into scene representation, D4DGS-SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction of dynamic scenes. Utilizing the dynamics-aware InfoModule, we can obtain the dynamics, visibility, and reliability of scene points, and filter out unstable dynamic points for tracking accordingly. When optimizing Gaussian points, we apply different isotropic regularization terms to Gaussians with varying dynamic characteristics. Experimental results on real-world dynamic scene datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both camera pose tracking and map quality.

arXiv:2505.03510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.

Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their coordinate along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial coordinates from dual-focal-plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization precision of 40 nanometers-six times better than traditional single-focal-plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current challenges in token compression research and outline promising future directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI community's advancement.

Abstract: Accurate placental segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of the placenta. However, this task is particularly challenging in T2*-weighted placental imaging due to: (1) weak and inconsistent boundary contrast across individual echoes; (2) the absence of manual ground truth annotations for all echo times; and (3) motion artifacts across echoes caused by fetal and maternal movement. In this work, we propose a contrast-augmented segmentation framework that leverages complementary information across multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI to learn robust, contrast-invariant representations. Our method integrates: (i) masked autoencoding (MAE) for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled multi-echo slices; (ii) masked pseudo-labeling (MPL) for unsupervised domain adaptation across echo times; and (iii) global-local collaboration to align fine-grained features with global anatomical context. We further introduce a semantic matching loss to encourage representation consistency across echoes of the same subject. Experiments on a clinical multi-echo placental MRI dataset demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively across echo times and outperforms both single-echo and naive fusion baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically exploit multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for placental segmentation.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

arXiv:2507.02668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to recalibrate semantic features. The key novelties of MEGANet-W include a two-level Haar wavelet head for multi-orientation edge extraction; and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (W-EGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with boundary and input branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANet-W consistently outperforms existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while introducing no additional learnable parameters. This approach improves reliability in difficult cases and offers a robust solution for medical image segmentation tasks requiring precise boundary detection.

Summary:
CounterNet is introduced to accurately count objects in large-scale point cloud data, addressing the limitations of existing detection models. The network focuses on detecting object presence by finding object centers, improving counting accuracy. A feature map partitioning strategy with overlapping regions enables better handling of objects in complex traffic scenes. A per-frame dynamic model selection strategy adapts to varying frame characteristics, selecting the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories. This enhancement results in more reliable query outcomes for three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, essential for tasks such as collision detection, traffic analysis, and congestion monitoring. <div>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data, state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework, Quality-guided Mixture of score-fusion Experts (QME), aimed at improving whole-body biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). This approach addresses the limitations of traditional unimodal systems by integrating multiple biometric modalities such as face, gait, and body.

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems. Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g., weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion \textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

Summary:
Multimodal models struggle more with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones. The bias-free Syn-TA dataset proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing greater performance drops in controlled settings. Larger models improve transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization. The study explores how disentangling coarse and fine motions can enhance recognition in temporally challenging datasets. This research introduces a crucial benchmark for evaluating motion transferability in action recognition. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2) Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization. We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action recognition. Datasets and relevant code: https://github.com/raiyaan-abdullah/Motion-Transfer.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Monado SLAM dataset aimed at addressing the limitations of existing tracking systems for head-mounted sensors in humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets. While advancements in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have improved tracking, challenges such as high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, and adverse lighting conditions still pose difficulties. Existing datasets may not adequately cover these real-world issues, prompting the creation of the Monado SLAM dataset. Real sequences from multiple virtual reality headsets are included in the dataset, released under a permissive CC BY 4.0 license to drive further research and development in VIO/SLAM technology. This dataset aims to facilitate progress in tackling challenging scenarios like long tracking sessions and low-textured areas, which are vital for enhancing the performance of head-mounted tracking systems. <div>

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0 license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields, including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising. Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters (7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical application in domains such as security and surveillance.

<div> evaluation metric, generative video models, World Consistency Score, internal world consistency, video coherence<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new evaluation metric called World Consistency Score (WCS) for generative video models. WCS focuses on internal world consistency in generated videos by incorporating four sub-components: object permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty. These components measure various aspects of temporal and physical coherence in videos. WCS combines these submetrics through a learned weighted formula to produce a single consistency score aligned with human judgments. The article details the motivation for WCS, the computation of each submetric using open-source tools, and the training of weights using human preference data. An experimental validation plan is outlined, which involves testing WCS's correlation with human evaluations, sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against established metrics like FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, and FVMD. The proposed WCS offers a comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation models based on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing gaps in existing metrics. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video. These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics, formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools (trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces GeoExplorer, an agent for Active Geo-localization (AGL) that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards. Unlike traditional methods that rely on distance-based rewards, GeoExplorer's goal-agnostic approach enables robust and diverse exploration in various environments. By effectively modeling the environment, GeoExplorer demonstrates improved generalization and robustness in localizing unfamiliar targets. The agent's capabilities are validated through experiments on four AGL benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in various settings. By emphasizing curiosity-driven exploration, GeoExplorer offers a more reliable exploration strategy and enhances the agent's ability to localize goals accurately. This innovative approach has the potential to address challenges in distance estimation and improve performance in challenging AGL tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text), within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward. They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards. Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic, enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings, particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

<div> Keywords: LiDAR, 3D sensors, point clouds, uncertainty, 3D object detection

Summary: 
Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC) is proposed as a novel 3D scene representation, enhancing each point with a probability attribute to capture measurement uncertainty. By incorporating the uncertainty information from raw LiDAR measurements into the point cloud construction, PPC improves robustness in downstream perception models. Inference approaches using PPC for 3D object detection demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional methods. These methods are lightweight and adaptable for integration into existing 3D processing pipelines. Simulations and real-world captures validate the effectiveness of PPC-based 3D inference methods in challenging scenarios like long-distance, low-albedo objects, and strong ambient light. The project webpage provides additional details on PPC and its applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects, producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

Summary:
The study introduces Selective Modality Shifting (SMS) to quantify biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in binary classification tasks using medical imaging datasets. It assesses six VLMs, revealing a reliance on text input over visual cues, even when complementary visual information is available. The study finds a marked dependency on text details, overshadowing image content, highlighting the need for genuinely integrated multimodal medical models. The perturbation-based approach exposes modality-specific biases, showing a disparity between model performance and calibration in both unperturbed and perturbed settings. Qualitative attention-based analysis further confirms the dominance of text information over visual cues. The findings emphasize the significance of designing and evaluating medical models that truly integrate visual and textual inputs.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray) and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings, we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

Summary: 
Structured graph "lineages" are defined, growing hierarchically with exponential increases in vertices and edges. Bipartite graphs connect levels and constrain matrices, while prolongation maps create distance measures between levels. A category of graded graphs allows for skeletal variants of algebraic operations. Skeletal binary operators exhibit algebraic and category-theoretic properties similar to standard operators. Graph lineages and skeletal constructors can approach continuum limit objects. Unary operators for graded graphs—thickening and escalation—are derived for creating multiscale graphs and search frontiers. This algebraic type theory for graded graphs and hierarchies is well-suited for defining hierarchical model architectures and local algorithms, demonstrated for deep neural networks and multigrid methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2) bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product, disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers (useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal" functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and (hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces) and to multigrid numerical methods.

<div> Keywords: real personality recognition, expressive behaviours, cognitive simulation, graph neural network, end-to-end strategy

Summary: <br /><br />Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to assess human real personality traits based on their expressive behaviours. Existing solutions often struggle to accurately infer real personalities from these behaviours, leading to subpar recognition performance. To address this issue, a novel approach is proposed that simulates personalized internal cognition from easily accessible external audio-visual behaviours of the target individual. This simulated cognition is represented as a graph structure using a 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) for personality trait inference. An end-to-end strategy is employed to jointly train the cognition simulation, graph construction, and personality recognition modules. By focusing on the association between real personality and internal cognition, this approach offers a more efficient and accurate way to recognize real personalities from expressive behaviours. <div>

However, most existing solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions, is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

<div> Keywords: SAM-PTx, segmentation, text prompts, semantic guidance, adapter design<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach that utilizes frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings for semantic guidance in segmentation tasks. The Parallel-Text adapter design injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enhancing segmentation performance while keeping the original architecture mostly frozen. By modifying the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, the adapter preserves the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Experimental results on the COD10K dataset and subsets of COCO and ADE20K demonstrate improved segmentation performance when incorporating fixed text embeddings as input. This work represents the first instance of using text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset, indicating the effectiveness of integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

Summary:
In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification where there is minimal data, dealing with image ambiguities caused by multiple objects or complex backgrounds can lead to performance degradation. This study demonstrates that incorporating information about the local positioning of objects in an image can significantly improve classification accuracy on standard benchmarks. Utilizing the Segment Anything Model or unsupervised foreground object extraction methods can achieve a notable portion of this improvement by simply highlighting a single pixel of the object of interest. By leveraging these techniques, classification performance can be enhanced even with limited training data, offering a promising avenue for improving few-shot image classification tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

<div> Keywords: depth map super-resolution, convolutional neural network, transformer, multi-scale fusion, state space modeling

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel depth map super-resolution model, MSF-UM, that combines the efficiency of Mamba's state-space modeling with a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color image. By integrating a residual dense channel attention block and the Mamba state space module, the model can capture both local features and long-distance dependencies in depth maps. A multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy is employed to utilize high-frequency texture information from the color image for guiding the super-resolution process. The proposed MSF-UM outperforms existing methods by reducing the number of model parameters and achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness and superior generalization ability, especially in large-scale depth map super-resolution tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba (MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute, and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to 31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency. To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus, inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework for continual learning in generative vision-language models. It addresses the issue of neglecting language instructions in favor of visual inputs by proposing a mixture of visual projectors specialized in translating visual information based on instruction context. An expert recommendation strategy is utilized to reuse experts for similar tasks, and expert pruning is implemented to reduce interference from previous tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in generating instruction-following responses. <div>

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models (VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches by generating instruction-following responses.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated. In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14 distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness, but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3) The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and real-world benchmarks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However, detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to better extract key facial features and improve detection performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and reliable drowsiness detection.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (TITAN-Guide), a new approach to training-free conditioning for diffusion models. Unlike existing methods, TITAN-Guide effectively manages memory requirements and provides more optimal control in the guidance process. By optimizing diffusion latents without backpropagation from a guiding model, the approach improves T2V performance across various diffusion guidance benchmarks. The study focuses on forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks with different directional directives. TITAN-Guide demonstrates the ability to significantly enhance T2V performance while minimizing memory requirements, making it a valuable tool for tasks that require intense computation. The code, models, and demo for TITAN-Guide are available on their website for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2508.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks. Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However, the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues, and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model. In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces AniMer+, an extension of the AniMer framework, which uses a high-capacity Vision Transformer (ViT) with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design to reconstruct mammals and birds. The model partitions network layers into species-specific and shared components, allowing for efficient learning of anatomical features. To address the lack of 3D training data for birds, a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline was introduced, creating the CtrlAni3D and CtrlAVES3D synthetic datasets. Trained on a mixture of real and synthetic data, AniMer+ outperformed existing methods, including on the challenging Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the novel network architecture and synthetic datasets in improving performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer (ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves) and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism, spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new approach for enhancing low-light images captured by event cameras. It decouples the enhancement pipeline into two stages: visibility restoration and structure refinement. The visibility restoration network incorporates amplitude-phase entanglement to improve image visibility. A fusion strategy is employed to refine image structure by aligning information from the frame and event data. Spatial-frequency interpolation is used to generate diverse negative samples for training, contributing to the development of a contrastive loss function that aids in learning discriminative representations. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing models. <div>
arXiv:2508.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency, provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution, capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance. Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for mathematical formula is essential for the intelligent analysis of scientific literature. However, both task-specific and general vision-language models often struggle to handle the structural diversity, complexity, and real-world variability inherent in mathematical content. In this work, we present DocTron-Formula, a unified framework built upon general vision-language models, thereby eliminating the need for specialized architectures. Furthermore, we introduce CSFormula, a large-scale and challenging dataset that encompasses multidisciplinary and structurally complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Sumutan/GV-VAD.git.

<div> Personalizing, text-to-image, diffusion models, fine-tuning, guidance<br />
Summary:<br />
Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting pre-trained models to specific target concepts. However, fine-tuning with few images can create a trade-off between aligning with the target distribution and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model. Existing sampling guidance methods have limitations in effectively guiding output towards a well-balanced space. To address these limitations, the proposed personalization guidance method leverages an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. This method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model through weight interpolation during inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which solely depend on guidance scales, this method explicitly steers outputs towards a balanced latent space without additional computational overhead. Experimental results show improved text alignment and target distribution fidelity, seamlessly integrating with various fine-tuning strategies.<br />  <div>

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover, our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Summary: 
This paper presents a novel calibration method for camera spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. The accurate calibration of camera spectral sensitivity is essential for tasks such as color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis in computer vision. Unlike existing methods that rely on specialized filters or reference targets with known spectral reflectances, the proposed method utilizes an uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet that is easily accessible. By capturing images of direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through the grating sheet, the method can estimate both camera spectral sensitivity and diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form solution.

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks, including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis. Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional reference target-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning. Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude 3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13% accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

<div> Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter, Multi-object tracking, ego-vehicle, dynamic scenarios, MotionScaleNet <br />
<br />Summary: 
The paper addresses the limitations of traditional tracking-by-detection methods in dynamic scenarios by introducing the Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF). SG-LKF takes into account ego-vehicle speed variations to improve tracking stability and accuracy. The model incorporates MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a network that predicts key parameters for SG-LKF. A self-supervised trajectory consistency loss is introduced to enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity. Experimental results show that SG-LKF achieves top performance on KITTI 2D MOT and KITTI 3D MOT datasets, as well as outperforming SimpleTrack on nuScenes 3D MOT. The proposed approach significantly improves tracking performance in highly dynamic scenarios by dynamically adapting uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed. <div>
arXiv:2508.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction, behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes, which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on nuScenes 3D MOT.

<div> Keywords: collaborative perception, spatio-temporal space, feature fusion, efficiency, accuracy

Summary: 
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) is introduced as an efficient approach for aggregating observations from multiple agents and different time instances into a unified spatio-temporal space simultaneously. By integrating multi-agent fusion and multi-time fusion into a unified spatial-temporal aggregation, CoST offers benefits of efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. This new method eliminates the need for re-transmitting object features multiple times, as each static object only requires transmission once in the spatial-temporal space. The holistic perspective provided by the unified space enhances perception performance in challenging scenarios. CoST is compatible with various existing methods and enhances their accuracy while reducing transmission bandwidth. Overall, CoST improves efficiency and accuracy in collaborative perception tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits, i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods, enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction, and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset. Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for hyperspectral instance-based classification.

<br />
Summary:<br />
SparseRecon is a new neural implicit reconstruction method designed for reconstructing 3D shapes or scenes from sparse RGB images. The method addresses issues faced by current methods, such as poor generalization and limited reconstruction quality due to insufficient geometry clues. SparseRecon utilizes a volume rendering-based feature consistency approach to ensure completeness and smoothness in the reconstruction results. Additionally, an uncertainty-guided depth constraint is employed to recover geometry details in areas with occlusion and insignificant features, leading to improved reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseRecon outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios with small overlapping views. The method's project page provides further information and demonstrates the superiority of SparseRecon in producing high-quality geometry from sparse-view inputs. <div>
arXiv:2508.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint. Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with small overlapping views.

Summary: 
Representation Shift introduces a training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the extent of change in a token's representation. This metric seamlessly integrates token compression techniques with FlashAttention, a fused attention kernel that reduces memory overhead by eliminating the need for attention map construction. The method is applicable to Transformers, CNNs, and state space models, enabling effective token compression without attention maps or retraining. Experimental results demonstrate significant speedups of up to 5.5% and 4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA tasks, respectively. The proposed approach provides a solution to the increasing computation cost of self-attention in complex tasks, offering a practical method to enhance efficiency in various models. The code implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration and utilization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language, and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and 4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively.

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.

The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model. Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

arXiv:2508.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights. Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA) framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals. Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.

Summary: <br />
Spatial transcriptomics enables precision oncology by revealing gene expression patterns in tissue context. Predicting spatial gene expression from histopathology images is a cost-effective alternative, but current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology using Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones fall short of clinical standards. To address this, a new hybrid backbone architecture, $MV_{Hybrid}$, combining state space models with ViT is proposed. Pretrained on colorectal cancer datasets using self-supervised learning, $MV_{Hybrid}$ outperforms ViT in gene expression prediction, showing superior performance and robustness. It also exhibits promising results in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks, positioning it as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. The code for $MV_{Hybrid}$ is publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a collaborative multi-agent system, Cued-Agent, for Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR). The system integrates four specialized sub-agents to decode hand movements and lip features, dynamically integrate hand prompts with lip features, and enable post-processing for phoneme-to-word conversion. The system was tested on a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects, including both normal and hearing-impaired cuers. Experimental results show that Cued-Agent outperforms existing methods in both scenarios. The implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration. This work addresses the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements in CS communication, leveraging multi-agent systems and expanding the Mandarin CS dataset for better training and evaluation. The proposed collaborative approach shows promising capabilities for effective ACSR in real-world applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.

<div> Keywords: Prompt tuning, visual-language models, information asymmetry, decouple-before-align, few-shot learning

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper introduces DAPT, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to address information asymmetry issues in vision-language models. By decoupling the visual modality into foreground and background representations and aligning them with corresponding textual prompts, DAPT ensures unbiased attention and strengthens modal alignment. Additionally, a visual pull-push regularization mechanism is proposed to enhance visual concentration on the region-of-interest object. The effectiveness of DAPT is demonstrated through improved performance in few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient learning tasks across various benchmarks. The DAPT framework is architecture-free and outperforms existing methods in enhancing task-specific transferability of vision-language models.

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm, has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality. Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the visual modality into the foreground and background representation via exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns, directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel detection framework for identifying forged videos generated by advanced diffusion-based models. The proposed approach combines RGB appearance features with optical flow residuals to effectively detect both appearance-level artifacts and subtle motion anomalies. By utilizing a dual-branch architecture, the model can capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies often present in AI-generated videos with high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate the robustness and generalization ability of the method, making it capable of detecting a wide range of forged videos.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong generalization ability of the proposed approach.

<div> Keywords: Vision-language models, industrial environments, iSafetyBench, hazardous activities, multimodal models

Summary: 
Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown success in diverse video understanding tasks, but their performance in industrial environments, where recognizing routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is crucial, is limited. To address this gap, a new benchmark called iSafetyBench has been introduced, specifically designed for evaluating model performance in industrial settings. The benchmark consists of 1,100 video clips from real-world industrial contexts, annotated with action tags covering routine and hazardous actions. Multiple-choice questions are provided for evaluating single-label and multi-label scenarios, revealing performance gaps in existing VLMs, particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label contexts. This highlights the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. The iSafetyBench dataset is available for further research and development in this area.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction.

Summary:
The article introduces a Dynamic Efficiency Index (DEI) to quantify video dynamic intensity in varying turbulence conditions and creates a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. A Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration (PMR) framework is proposed, consisting of de-tilting for geometric stabilization, motion segmentation enhancement for dynamic region refinement, and de-blurring for quality restoration.

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization, \textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and \textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code and datasets openly available.

arXiv:2508.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders designed for high-resolution diffusion models. It addresses the issue of slow convergence in diffusion models when increasing the latent channel number, which can lead to a trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality. DC-AE 1.5 introduces two key innovations to overcome this challenge: Structured Latent Space, which imposes a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space for better object structure and image detail capture, and Augmented Diffusion Training, a strategy that enhances convergence by adding diffusion training objectives on object latent channels. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 achieves faster convergence and improved diffusion scaling results compared to its predecessor, DC-AE. In experiments on ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE 1.5 outperforms DC-AE in image generation quality while also being four times faster. <div>

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality. However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code: https://github.com/dc-ai-projects/DC-Gen.

<div> object flow learning, video outpainting, inpainting models, discriminator designs, adversarial training

Summary:
This paper introduces a method for enhancing video outpainting by utilizing object flow learning from inpainting models. The traditional fine-tuning approach for inpainting models in outpainting tasks often results in blurry outputs. The key improvement proposed is the use of a hierarchical discriminator that focuses on both global and local objectives in assessing outpainted areas. A specialized outpainting loss function leverages features from the discriminator to enhance the generator's ability to create visually appealing and globally coherent outpainted scenes. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. The supplementary materials, including a demo video and code, are available for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

<div> Mamba, Underwater Instance Segmentation, Dynamic Tree Scan, Hidden State Weaken, UIS-Mamba <br />
Summary:
Mamba is a state space model that can be adapted for underwater instance segmentation. A new model, UIS-Mamba, is proposed with innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), designed to address challenges in underwater scene segmentation. The DTS module maintains internal feature continuity by dynamically offsetting and scaling patches, while the HSW module suppresses complex background interference. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on UIIS and USIS10K datasets with low parameters and computational complexity. The code for UIS-Mamba is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Maricalce/UIS-Mamba. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However, due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity.

Summary: <br /><br />Researchers have introduced a novel approach to improve amodal completion in dynamic human-object interaction scenarios. By leveraging physical prior knowledge and a specialized multi-regional inpainting technique, the model identifies primary and secondary regions for occlusion handling. Customized denoising strategies are applied within a diffusion model to enhance completion accuracy and realism in shape and detail. The proposed method surpasses existing techniques in generating plausible completions, advancing machine perception towards human-like understanding of dynamic environments. Moreover, the approach demonstrates robustness even without ground-truth contact annotations, extending its utility to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis. <div>
arXiv:2508.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions: the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

Summary:
A new approach is proposed for addressing challenges in training machine learning models for aerial inspection of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants using drones. A synthetic dataset called AerialCSP is introduced to simulate real-world conditions and facilitate model pretraining. The dataset provides annotated data for object detection and image segmentation tasks, and multiple models are benchmarked on AerialCSP to establish a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks. Pretraining on AerialCSP is shown to improve real-world fault detection, especially for rare and small defects, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. The AerialCSP dataset is made publicly available, offering a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment, significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling.

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications, such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2 improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation (TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS models.

Summary: 
Recent advances in interactive matting have been successful in capturing main object regions but struggle with fine details in edge regions. This study introduces SDMatte, a diffusion-driven interactive matting model. It leverages diffusion models' data distribution modeling and text-driven interaction capabilities to enable interactive matting. By incorporating visual prompts and opacity embeddings into a U-Net architecture, SDMatte improves sensitivity to spatial and opacity information. Additionally, a masked self-attention mechanism focuses the model on specified areas, enhancing performance. Extensive experiments across various datasets confirm the effectiveness of SDMatte in interactive matting tasks. The code and model for SDMatte are publicly available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information. Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

Summary:
AutoDebias is a novel framework designed to automatically detect and mitigate social biases present in Text-to-Image (T2I) models. It addresses both subtle and overlapping biases, which existing methods struggle with. The framework leverages vision-language models to identify biased visual patterns and create fairness guides by generating inclusive alternative prompts. These guides drive a training process guided by CLIP, resulting in fairer outputs while maintaining image quality and diversity. In evaluations covering over 25 bias scenarios, AutoDebias achieved a 91.6% accuracy in detecting harmful patterns and reduced biased outputs significantly. The framework successfully tackled challenging cases involving multiple interacting biases, effectively lowering biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels. <div>
arXiv:2508.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes, even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods, AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25 bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the visual fidelity of the original model.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research. Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs, highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological monitoring applications.

<title>PIF-Net: Ill-Posed Prior Guided Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion via Invertible Mamba and Fusion-Aware LoRA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba architecture that maintains information consistency during feature transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods while maintaining model efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex video super-resolution tasks.

<title>HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2) Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale accordingly. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/Suchenl/LAMIC.

Abstract: We present SAMSA 2.0, an interactive segmentation framework for hyperspectral medical imaging that introduces spectral angle prompting to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM) using spectral similarity alongside spatial cues.

arXiv:2508.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation, they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening, detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA) block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans; and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5% in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening.

arXiv:2508.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work, we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be formed within the encoding space.

<title>Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Grounding on Egocentric Videos</title>

arXiv:2508.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored, despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask, the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-, medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets. Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/EgoMask .

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network (EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed, while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

<title>Video Color Grading via Look-Up Table Generation</title>

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc. Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

<title>Your other Left! Vision-Language Models Fail to Identify Relative Positions in Medical Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite. Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o, Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset, designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative positions in medical images.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising, severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time adversarial purification.

arXiv:2508.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue, they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3% tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Danielement321/HiPrune.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS. Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance. However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity. The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP, as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when combined with other OVSS methods.

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs. Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects. We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is limited.

<title>CoProU-VO: Combining Projected Uncertainty for End-to-End Unsupervised Monocular Visual Odometry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty. Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language. Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval, when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

<title>A Novel Modeling Framework and Data Product for Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light Image Reconstruction (1986-2024)</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00590</link>

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities. Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details. Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the $\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99. Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource for the research community and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

<title>Wukong Framework for Not Safe For Work Detection in Text-to-Image systems</title>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.

<title>GeoMoE: Divide-and-Conquer Motion Field Modeling with Mixture-of-Experts for Two-View Geometry</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00592</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00592</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias. Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/JiajunLe/GeoMoE.

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for whole-body human pose prior modeling.

Abstract: Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture images under varying conditions,such as inconsistent lighting, or diverse face poses. These challenges require including a Face Detection module that regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment. This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face Detection, dubbed Face Generation Attacks, and demonstrates for the first time a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs. However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of explainable models in medical image analysis.

<title>Revisiting Adversarial Patch Defenses on Object Detectors: Unified Evaluation, Large-Scale Dataset, and New Insights</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3) Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust. We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new attacks/defenses.

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our approach.

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video, VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo, D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

<title>MIHBench: Benchmarking and Mitigating Multi-Image Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2508.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the 'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

<title>Rethinking Backbone Design for Lightweight 3D Object Detection in LiDAR</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29% reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2% drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

arXiv:2508.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g., left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2% faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively. Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature learning.

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

arXiv:2508.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN, segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion. However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples, demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods, whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2) a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data. Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and localization under domain shift.

<title>Cross-Dataset Semantic Segmentation Performance Analysis: Unifying NIST Point Cloud City Datasets for 3D Deep Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00822</link>

arXiv:2508.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability: geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

<title>IGL-Nav: Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization for Image-goal Navigation</title>

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian (3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to capture goal image at arbitrary pose.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of anatomical structures in volumetric CT scans is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. While AI has advanced automated segmentation, current approaches typically target individual structures, creating a fragmented landscape of incompatible models with varying performance and disparate evaluation protocols. Foundational segmentation models address these limitations by providing a holistic anatomical view through a single model. Yet, robust clinical deployment demands comprehensive training data, which is lacking in existing whole-body approaches, both in terms of data heterogeneity and, more importantly, anatomical coverage. In this work, rather than pursuing incremental optimizations in model architecture, we present CADS, an open-source framework that prioritizes the systematic integration, standardization, and labeling of heterogeneous data sources for whole-body CT segmentation. At its core is a large-scale dataset of 22,022 CT volumes with complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures, representing a significant advancement in both scale and coverage, with 18 times more scans than existing collections and 60% more distinct anatomical targets. Building on this diverse dataset, we develop the CADS-model using established architectures for accessible and automated full-body CT segmentation. Through comprehensive evaluation across 18 public datasets and an independent real-world hospital cohort, we demonstrate advantages over SoTA approaches. Notably, thorough testing of the model's performance in segmentation tasks from radiation oncology validates its direct utility for clinical interventions. By making our large-scale dataset, our segmentation models, and our clinical software tool publicly available, we aim to advance robust AI solutions in radiology and make comprehensive anatomical analysis accessible to clinicians and researchers alike.

Abstract: This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic) Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers, and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance, averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics. We provide the implementation and dataset at https://github.com/tomek1911/GEPAR3D.

<title>Towards Higher Effective Rank in Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning using Khatri--Rao Product</title>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties. Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks. To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune billion-scale parameter models.

<title>Weakly Supervised Intracranial Aneurysm Detection and Segmentation in MR angiography via Multi-task UNet with Vesselness Prior</title>

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate = 1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).

Abstract: This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion models for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark, gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents. We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based diffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in computational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for High Energy Physics (HEP) research.

<title>UAV-ON: A Benchmark for Open-World Object Goal Navigation with Aerial Agents</title>

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality, marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan, a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion, producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an average accuracy of 83%. Interactive videos of Omni-Scan 3DGS models can be found at https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/omni-scan/

<title>CoRGI: Verified Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Visual Grounding</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose \textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module (VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual evidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great performance gap compared to floating-point Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow this gap. However, these designs often span multiple deep layers, resulting in costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding (TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF).Extensive experiments show that STF consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K, under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF enhances the diversity of the spike patterns, which is key to performance gain. Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<title>Occlusion-robust Stylization for Drawing-based 3D Animation</title>

Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts, leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a `stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions. To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow, ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving 2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.

Abstract: Coronary stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic heart events leading to increased mortality, and medical treatments for this condition require meticulous, labor-intensive analysis. Coronary angiography provides critical visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable decision support.

Abstract: In neural-decoding studies, recordings of participants' responses to stimuli are used to train models. In recent years, there has been an explosion of publications detailing applications of innovations from deep-learning research to neural-decoding studies. The data-hungry models used in these experiments have resulted in a demand for increasingly large datasets. Consequently, in some studies, the same stimuli are presented multiple times to each participant to increase the number of trials available for use in model training. However, when a decoding model is trained and subsequently evaluated on responses to the same stimuli, stimulus identity becomes a confounder for accuracy. We term this the repeated-stimulus confound. We identify a susceptible dataset, and 16 publications which report model performance based on evaluation procedures affected by the confound. We conducted experiments using models from the affected studies to investigate the likely extent to which results in the literature have been misreported. Our findings suggest that the decoding accuracies of these models were overestimated by between 4.46-7.42%. Our analysis also indicates that per 1% increase in accuracy under the confound, the magnitude of the overestimation increases by 0.26%. The confound not only results in optimistic estimates of decoding performance, but undermines the validity of several claims made within the affected publications. We conducted further experiments to investigate the implications of the confound in alternative contexts. We found that the same methodology used within the affected studies could also be used to justify an array of pseudoscientific claims, such as the existence of extrasensory perception.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8 seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and generality.

Abstract: The growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) presents serious challenges to space sustainability, primarily due to the increased risk of in-orbit collisions. Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard, vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness and contribute to long-term space sustainability.

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-based person retrieval seeks to retrieve images of a target person using textual descriptions, without relying on identity annotations and is more challenging and practical. The primary challenge is the intra-class differences, encompassing intra-modal feature variations and cross-modal semantic gaps. Prior works have focused on instance-level samples and ignored prototypical features of each person which are intrinsic and invariant. Toward this, we propose a Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning (CPCL) method. In practice, the CPCL introduces the CLIP model to weakly supervised text-based person retrieval to map visual and textual instances into a shared latent space. Subsequently, the proposed Prototypical Multi-modal Memory (PMM) module captures associations between heterogeneous modalities of image-text pairs belonging to the same person through the Hybrid Cross-modal Matching (HCM) module in a many-to-many mapping fashion. Moreover, the Outlier Pseudo Label Mining (OPLM) module further distinguishes valuable outlier samples from each modality, enhancing the creation of more reliable clusters by mining implicit relationships between image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks of weakly supervised text-based person retrieval, which validate the effectiveness, generalizability of CPCL.

Abstract: We introduce Gaga, a framework that reconstructs and segments open-world 3D scenes by leveraging inconsistent 2D masks predicted by zero-shot class-agnostic segmentation models. Contrasted to prior 3D scene segmentation approaches that rely on video object tracking or contrastive learning methods, Gaga utilizes spatial information and effectively associates object masks across diverse camera poses through a novel 3D-aware memory bank. By eliminating the assumption of continuous view changes in training images, Gaga demonstrates robustness to variations in camera poses, particularly beneficial for sparsely sampled images, ensuring precise mask label consistency. Furthermore, Gaga accommodates 2D segmentation masks from diverse sources and demonstrates robust performance with different open-world zero-shot class-agnostic segmentation models, significantly enhancing its versatility. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that Gaga performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing its potential for real-world applications such as 3D scene understanding and manipulation.

Abstract: Transfer-based attacks craft adversarial examples on white-box surrogate models and directly deploy them against black-box target models, offering model-agnostic and query-free threat scenarios. While flatness-enhanced methods have recently emerged to improve transferability by enhancing the loss surface flatness of adversarial examples, their divergent flatness definitions and heuristic attack designs suffer from unexamined optimization limitations and missing theoretical foundation, thus constraining their effectiveness and efficiency. This work exposes the severely imbalanced exploitation-exploration dynamics in flatness optimization, establishing the first theoretical foundation for flatness-based transferability and proposing a principled framework to overcome these optimization pitfalls. Specifically, we systematically unify fragmented flatness definitions across existing methods, revealing their imbalanced optimization limitations in over-exploration of sensitivity peaks or over-exploitation of local plateaus. To resolve these issues, we rigorously formalize average-case flatness and transferability gaps, proving that enhancing zeroth-order average-case flatness minimizes cross-model discrepancies. Building on this theory, we design a Maximin Expected Flatness (MEF) attack that enhances zeroth-order average-case flatness while balancing flatness exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations across 22 models and 24 current transfer-based attacks demonstrate MEF's superiority: it surpasses the state-of-the-art PGN attack by 4% in attack success rate at half the computational cost and achieves 8% higher success rate under the same budget. When combined with input augmentation, MEF attains 15% additional gains against defense-equipped models, establishing new robustness benchmarks.

<title>Accurate Cross-modal Reconstruction of Vehicle Target from Sparse-aspect Multi-baseline SAR data</title>

Abstract: Multi-aspect multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging is a critical remote sensing technique, promising in urban mapping and monitoring. However, sparse observation due to constrained flight trajectories degrade imaging quality, particularly for anisotropic small targets like vehicles and aircraft. In the past, compressive sensing (CS) was the mainstream approach for sparse 3D SAR reconstruction. More recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful alternative, markedly boosting reconstruction quality and efficiency through strong data-driven representations capabilities and fast inference characteristics. However, existing DL methods typically train deep neural networks (DNNs) using only high-resolution radar images. This unimodal learning paradigm precludes the incorporation of complementary information from other data sources, thereby limiting potential improvements in reconstruction performance. In this paper, we introduce cross-modal learning and propose a Cross-Modal 3D-SAR Reconstruction Network (CMAR-Net) that enhances sparse 3D SAR reconstruction by fusing heterogeneous information. Leveraging cross-modal supervision from 2D optical images and error propagation guaranteed by differentiable rendering, CMAR-Net achieves efficient training and reconstructs highly sparse-aspect multi-baseline SAR image into visually structured and accurate 3D images, particularly for vehicle targets. Trained solely on simulated data, CMAR-Net exhibits strong generalization across extensive real-world evaluations on parking lot measurements containing numerous civilian vehicles, outperforming state-of-the-art CS and DL methods in structural accuracy. Our work highlights the potential of cross-modal learning for 3D SAR reconstruction and introduces a novel framework for radar imaging research.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) navigation agents can enhance user experience in communication, entertainment, and productivity by streamlining workflows and reducing manual intervention. However, prior GUI agents often trained with datasets comprising tasks that can be completed within a single app, leading to poor performance in cross-app navigation. To address this problem, we present GUIOdyssey, a comprehensive dataset for cross-app mobile GUI navigation. GUIOdyssey comprises 8,334 episodes with an average of 15.3 steps per episode, covering 6 mobile devices, 212 distinct apps, and 1,357 app combinations. Each step is enriched with detailed semantic reasoning annotations, which aid the model in building cognitive processes and enhancing its reasoning abilities for complex cross-app tasks. Building on GUIOdyssey, we develop OdysseyAgent, an exploratory multimodal agent for long-step cross-app navigation equipped with a history resampler module that efficiently attends to historical screenshot tokens, balancing performance and inference speed. Extensive experiments conducted in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios validate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that historial information involving actions, screenshots and context in our dataset can significantly enhances OdysseyAgent's performance on complex cross-app tasks.

<title>A Physical Model-Guided Framework for Underwater Image Enhancement and Depth Estimation</title>

Abstract: Due to the selective absorption and scattering of light by diverse aquatic media, underwater images usually suffer from various visual degradations. Existing underwater image enhancement (UIE) approaches that combine underwater physical imaging models with neural networks often fail to accurately estimate imaging model parameters such as depth and veiling light, resulting in poor performance in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a physical model-guided framework for jointly training a Deep Degradation Model (DDM) with any advanced UIE model. DDM includes three well-designed sub-networks to accurately estimate various imaging parameters: a veiling light estimation sub-network, a factors estimation sub-network, and a depth estimation sub-network. Based on the estimated parameters and the underwater physical imaging model, we impose physical constraints on the enhancement process by modeling the relationship between underwater images and desired clean images, i.e., outputs of the UIE model. Moreover, while our framework is compatible with any UIE model, we design a simple yet effective fully convolutional UIE model, termed UIEConv. UIEConv utilizes both global and local features for image enhancement through a dual-branch structure. UIEConv trained within our framework achieves remarkable enhancement results across diverse underwater scenes. Furthermore, as a byproduct of UIE, the trained depth estimation sub-network enables accurate underwater scene depth estimation. Extensive experiments conducted in various real underwater imaging scenarios, including deep-sea environments with artificial light sources, validate the effectiveness of our framework and the UIEConv model.

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) typically necessitates extensive computational costs of deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract multi-modal representations. In this paper, we propose an intriguing question: May we learn from multiple modalities only during training to avoid multi-modal input in the inference phase? To answer it, we propose \textbf{YOLOO}, a novel multi-modal 3D MOT paradigm: You Only Learn from Others Once. YOLOO empowers the point cloud encoder to learn a unified tri-modal representation (UTR) from point clouds and other modalities, such as images and textual cues, all at once. Leveraging this UTR, YOLOO achieves efficient tracking solely using the point cloud encoder without compromising its performance, fundamentally obviating the need for computationally intensive DNNs. Specifically, YOLOO includes two core components: a unified tri-modal encoder (UTEnc) and a flexible geometric constraint (F-GC) module. UTEnc integrates a point cloud encoder with image and text encoders adapted from pre-trained CLIP. It seamlessly fuses point cloud information with rich visual-textual knowledge from CLIP into the point cloud encoder, yielding highly discriminative UTRs that facilitate the association between trajectories and detections. Additionally, F-GC filters out mismatched associations with similar representations but significant positional discrepancies. It further enhances the robustness of UTRs without requiring any scene-specific tuning, addressing a key limitation of customized geometric constraints (e.g., 3D IoU). Lastly, high-quality 3D trajectories are generated by a traditional data association component. By integrating these advancements into a multi-modal 3D MOT scheme, our YOLOO achieves substantial gains in both robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce AttnMod, a training-free technique that modulates cross-attention in pre-trained diffusion models to generate novel, unpromptable art styles. The method is inspired by how a human artist might reinterpret a generated image, for example by emphasizing certain features, dispersing color, twisting silhouettes, or materializing unseen elements. AttnMod simulates this intent by altering how the text prompt conditions the image through attention during denoising. These targeted modulations enable diverse stylistic transformations without changing the prompt or retraining the model, and they expand the expressive capacity of text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Event cameras, known for their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous changes, have gained significant attention for their potential in feature tracking, especially in challenging conditions. However, event cameras lack the fine-grained texture information that conventional cameras provide, leading to error accumulation in tracking. To address this, we propose a novel framework, BlinkTrack, which integrates event data with grayscale images for high-frequency feature tracking. Our method extends the traditional Kalman filter into a learning-based framework, utilizing differentiable Kalman filters in both event and image branches. This approach improves single-modality tracking and effectively solves the data association and fusion from asynchronous event and image data. We also introduce new synthetic and augmented datasets to better evaluate our model. Experimental results indicate that BlinkTrack significantly outperforms existing methods, exceeding 80 FPS with multi-modality data and 100 FPS with preprocessed event data. Codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/ColieShen/BlinkTrack.

Abstract: The development of video large multimodal models (LMMs) has been hindered by the difficulty of curating large amounts of high-quality raw data from the web. To address this, we propose an alternative approach by creating a high-quality synthetic dataset specifically for video instruction-following, namely LLaVA-Video-178K. This dataset includes key tasks such as detailed captioning, open-ended question-answering (QA), and multiple-choice QA. By training on this dataset, in combination with existing visual instruction tuning data, we introduce LLaVA-Video, a new video LMM. Our experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-Video achieves strong performance across various video benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset. We plan to release the dataset, its generation pipeline, and the model checkpoints.

Abstract: We propose Long-LRM, a feed-forward 3D Gaussian reconstruction model for instant, high-resolution, 360{\deg} wide-coverage, scene-level reconstruction. Specifically, it takes in 32 input images at a resolution of 960x540 and produces the Gaussian reconstruction in just 1 second on a single A100 GPU. To handle the long sequence of 250K tokens brought by the large input size, Long-LRM features a mixture of the recent Mamba2 blocks and the classical transformer blocks, enhanced by a light-weight token merging module and Gaussian pruning steps that balance between quality and efficiency. We evaluate Long-LRM on the large-scale DL3DV benchmark and Tanks&amp;Temples, demonstrating reconstruction quality comparable to the optimization-based methods while achieving an 800x speedup w.r.t. the optimization-based approaches and an input size at least 60x larger than the previous feed-forward approaches. We conduct extensive ablation studies on our model design choices for both rendering quality and computation efficiency. We also explore Long-LRM's compatibility with other Gaussian variants such as 2D GS, which enhances Long-LRM's ability in geometry reconstruction.

Abstract: Image shadow removal is a common low-level vision problem. Shadows cause sudden brightness changes in some areas, which can affect the accuracy of downstream tasks. Currently, Transformer-based shadow removal methods improve computational efficiency by using a window mechanism. However, this approach reduces the effective receptive field and weakens the ability to model long-range dependencies in shadow images. Recently, Mamba has achieved significant success in computer vision by modeling long-sequence information globally with linear complexity. However, when applied to shadow removal, its original scanning mechanism overlooks the semantic continuity along shadow boundaries, and the coherence within each region. To solve this issue, we propose a new boundary-region selective scanning mechanism that scans shadow, boundary, and non-shadow regions separately, making pixels of the same type closer in the sequence. This increases semantic continuity and helps the model understand local details better. Incorporating this idea, we design the first Mamba-based lightweight shadow removal model, called ShadowMamba. It uses a hierarchical combination U-Net structure, which effectively reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity. Shallow layers rely on our boundary-region selective scanning to capture local details, while deeper layers use global cross-scanning to learn global brightness features. Extensive experiments show that ShadowMamba outperforms current state-of-the-art models on ISTD+, ISTD, and SRD datasets, and it also requires fewer parameters and less computational cost. (Code will be made available upon paper acceptance.)

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks. Codes are available at: https://github.com/zdk258/CorrCLIP.

Abstract: Panoramic Image Generation (PIG) aims to create coherent images of arbitrary lengths. Most existing methods fall in the joint diffusion paradigm, but their complex and heuristic crop connection designs often limit their ability to achieve multilevel coherence. By deconstructing this challenge into its core components, we find it naturally aligns with next-token prediction, leading us to adopt an autoregressive (AR) paradigm for PIG modeling. However, existing visual AR (VAR) models are limited to fixed-size generation, lacking the capability to produce panoramic images. In this paper, we propose PanoLlama, a novel framework that achieves endless and coherent panorama generation with the autoregressive paradigm. Our approach develops a training-free strategy that utilizes token redirection to overcome the size limitations of existing VAR models, enabling next-crop prediction in both horizontal and vertical directions. This refreshes the PIG pipeline while achieving SOTA performance in coherence (47.50%), fidelity(28.16%), and aesthetics (15%). Additionally, PanoLlama supports applications other PIG methods cannot achieve, including mask-free layout control, multi-scale and multi-guidance synthesis. To facilitate standardized evaluation, we also establish a dataset with 1,000 prompts spanning 100+ themes, providing a new testing benchmark for PIG research. The code is available at https://github.com/0606zt/PanoLlama.

Abstract: Domain randomization through synthesis is a powerful strategy to train networks that are unbiased with respect to the domain of the input images. Randomization allows networks to see a virtually infinite range of intensities and artifacts during training, thereby minimizing overfitting to appearance and maximizing generalization to unseen data. Although powerful, this approach relies on the accurate tuning of a large set of hyperparameters that govern the probabilistic distribution of the synthesized images. Instead of manually tuning these parameters, we introduce Learn2Synth, a novel procedure in which synthesis parameters are learned using a small set of real labeled data. Unlike methods that impose constraints to align synthetic data with real data (e.g., contrastive or adversarial techniques), which risk misaligning the image and its label map, we tune an augmentation engine such that a segmentation network trained on synthetic data has optimal accuracy when applied to real data. This approach allows the training procedure to benefit from real labeled examples, without ever using these real examples to train the segmentation network, which avoids biasing the network towards the properties of the training set. Specifically, we develop parametric and nonparametric strategies to enhance synthetic images in a way that improves the performance of the segmentation network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this learning strategy on synthetic and real-world brain scans. Code is available at: https://github.com/HuXiaoling/Learn2Synth.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Human pose estimation methods work well on isolated people but struggle with multiple-bodies-in-proximity scenarios. Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models. Code and models are available on https://MiraPurkrabek.github.io/BBox-Mask-Pose.

Abstract: Although open-vocabulary classification models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have demonstrated strong zero-shot learning capabilities, their robustness to common image corruptions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments, we show that zero-shot CLIP lacks robustness to common image corruptions during test-time, necessitating the adaptation of CLIP to unlabeled corrupted images using test-time adaptation (TTA). However, we found that existing TTA methods have severe limitations in adapting CLIP due to their unimodal nature. To address these limitations, we propose $\texttt{BATCLIP}$, a bimodal $\textbf{online}$ TTA method designed to improve CLIP's robustness to common image corruptions. The key insight of our approach is not only to adapt the visual encoders for improving image features but also to strengthen the alignment between image and text features by promoting a stronger association between the image class prototype, computed using pseudo-labels, and the corresponding text feature. We evaluate our approach on benchmark image corruption datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in online TTA for CLIP. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed TTA approach on various domain generalization datasets to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce NoiseQuery as a novel method for enhanced noise initialization in versatile goal-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation. Specifically, we propose to leverage an aligned Gaussian noise as implicit guidance to complement explicit user-defined inputs, such as text prompts, for better generation quality and controllability. Unlike existing noise optimization methods designed for specific models, our approach is grounded in a fundamental examination of the generic finite-step noise scheduler design in diffusion formulation, allowing better generalization across different diffusion-based architectures in a tuning-free manner. This model-agnostic nature allows us to construct a reusable noise library compatible with multiple T2I models and enhancement techniques, serving as a foundational layer for more effective generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NoiseQuery enables fine-grained control and yields significant performance boosts not only over high-level semantics but also over low-level visual attributes, which are typically difficult to specify through text alone, with seamless integration into current workflows with minimal computational overhead.

<title>Feather the Throttle: Revisiting Visual Token Pruning for Vision-Language Model Acceleration</title>

Abstract: Recent works on accelerating Vision-Language Models achieve strong performance across a variety of vision-language tasks despite highly compressing visual information. In this work, we examine the popular acceleration approach of early pruning of visual tokens inside the language model. Surprisingly, we find that while strong performance is maintained across many tasks, it exhibits drastically different behavior for a subset of vision-centric tasks such as localization. Upon further investigation, we uncover a core issue with the acceleration approach where most tokens towards the top of the image are pruned away. Yet, on many benchmarks aiming to evaluate vision-centric capabilities, strong performance persists with the flawed pruning strategy, highlighting these benchmarks' limited ability to assess fine-grained visual capabilities. Based on these findings, we propose FEATHER (Fast and Effective Acceleration wiTH Ensemble cRiteria), a straightforward approach that resolves the discovered early-layer pruning issue and further enhances the preservation of relevant tokens via multistage pruning with early uniform sampling to ensure broad image coverage. With comparable computational savings, we find that FEATHER achieves more than 5x performance improvement on the vision-centric localization benchmarks compared to the original acceleration approach.

<title>FaceLift: Learning Generalizable Single Image 3D Face Reconstruction from Synthetic Heads</title>

Abstract: We present FaceLift, a novel feed-forward approach for generalizable high-quality 360-degree 3D head reconstruction from a single image. Our pipeline first employs a multi-view latent diffusion model to generate consistent side and back views from a single facial input, which then feeds into a transformer-based reconstructor that produces a comprehensive 3D Gaussian splats representation. Previous methods for monocular 3D face reconstruction often lack full view coverage or view consistency due to insufficient multi-view supervision. We address this by creating a high-quality synthetic head dataset that enables consistent supervision across viewpoints. To bridge the domain gap between synthetic training data and real-world images, we propose a simple yet effective technique that ensures the view generation process maintains fidelity to the input by learning to reconstruct the input image alongside the view generation. Despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, our method demonstrates remarkable generalization to real-world images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that FaceLift outperforms state-of-the-art 3D face reconstruction methods on identity preservation, detail recovery, and rendering quality.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved notable progress in aligning visual inputs with text. However, their ability to deeply understand the unique physical properties of non-RGB vision sensor images remains limited. In this paper, we revisit and analyze these limitations and introduce a novel, cost-efficient paradigm that significantly advances sensor image understanding-without requiring extensive training data or any modifications to the existing VLM architectures. Specifically, we propose Sensor-Aware Attributes Fine-Tuning (SAFT) with the Diverse Negative Attributes (DNA) optimization, which leverages minimal sensor-specific data to enable robust learning of non-RGB characteristics and overcome RGB-centric biases inherent in current VLMs. In addition, we present VS-TDX-the first comprehensive, public benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate VLMs' sensor-specific understanding across diverse and realistic scenarios. Through extensive experiments on VLMs and various sensor modalities, we validate that our method consistently delivers superior performance and generalization under resource-constrained and architecture-invariant settings. Our approach provides a practical advance towards scalable deployment of VLMs in increasingly sensor-diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Generative videos have the potential to revolutionize game development by autonomously creating new content. In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework for action-controlled scene-generalizable game video generation. We first address the fundamental challenge of action controllability by introducing GF-Minecraft, an action-annotated game video dataset without human bias, and developing an action control module that enables precise control over both keyboard and mouse inputs. We further extend to support autoregressive generation for unlimited-length interactive videos. More importantly, GameFactory tackles the critical challenge of scene-generalizable action control, which most existing methods fail to address. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games beyond fixed styles and scenes, we leverage the open-domain generative priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets, we propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples game style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action control learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving scene-generalizable action control. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation.

Abstract: Calibrating large-scale camera arrays, such as those in dome-based setups, is time-intensive and typically requires dedicated captures of known patterns. While extrinsics in such arrays are fixed due to the physical setup, intrinsics often vary across sessions due to factors like lens adjustments or temperature changes. In this paper, we propose a dense-feature-driven multi-frame calibration method that refines intrinsics directly from scene data, eliminating the necessity for additional calibration captures. Our approach enhances traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines by introducing an extrinsics regularization term to progressively align estimated extrinsics with ground-truth values, a dense feature reprojection term to reduce keypoint errors by minimizing reprojection loss in the feature space, and an intrinsics variance term for joint optimization across multiple frames. Experiments on the Multiface dataset show that our method achieves nearly the same precision as dedicated calibration processes, and significantly enhances intrinsics and 3D reconstruction accuracy. Fully compatible with existing SfM pipelines, our method provides an efficient and practical plug-and-play solution for large-scale camera setups.

Abstract: Multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) synthesizes multiple, differently exposed images of the same scene into a single, well-exposed composite. Retinex theory, which separates image illumination from scene reflectance, provides a natural framework to ensure consistent scene representation and effective information fusion across varied exposure levels. However, the conventional pixel-wise multiplication of illumination and reflectance inadequately models the glare effect induced by overexposure. To address this limitation, we introduce an unsupervised and controllable method termed Retinex-MEF. Specifically, our method decomposes multi-exposure images into separate illumination components with a shared reflectance component, and effectively models the glare induced by overexposure. The shared reflectance is learned via a bidirectional loss, which enables our approach to effectively mitigate the glare effect. Furthermore, we introduce a controllable exposure fusion criterion, enabling global exposure adjustments while preserving contrast, thus overcoming the constraints of a fixed exposure level. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including underexposure-overexposure fusion, exposure controlled fusion, and homogeneous extreme exposure fusion, demonstrate the effective decomposition and flexible fusion capability of our model.

Abstract: Advances in Earth observation (EO) foundation models have unlocked the potential of big satellite data to learn generic representations from space, benefiting a wide range of downstream applications crucial to our planet. However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research. Codes, datasets and models are available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/Copernicus-FM.

Abstract: Event cameras are emerging vision sensors whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras are often designed in isolation and thus consider other tasks, such as motion estimation, separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the one-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while demonstrating effectiveness across motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks. Our approach advances event-data denoising theory and expands practical denoising use-cases via open-source code. Project page: https://github.com/tub-rip/ESMD

Abstract: Verifying the authenticity of identity documents (IDs) has become a critical challenge for real-life applications such as digital banking, crypto-exchanges, renting, etc. This study focuses on the topic of fake ID detection, covering several limitations in the field. In particular, there are no publicly available data from real IDs for proper research in this area, and most published studies rely on proprietary internal databases that are not available for privacy reasons. In order to advance this critical challenge of real data scarcity that makes it so difficult to advance the technology of machine learning-based fake ID detection, we introduce a new patch-based methodology that trades off privacy and performance, and propose a novel patch-wise approach for privacy-aware fake ID detection: FakeIDet. In our experiments, we explore: i) two levels of anonymization for an ID (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii) different patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data visible in the patch image. State-of-the-art methods, such as vision transformers and foundation models, are considered as backbones. Our results show that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our proposal for fake ID detection achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at the patch and the whole ID level, showing a good generalization to other databases. In addition to the path-based methodology introduced and the new FakeIDet method based on it, another key contribution of our article is the release of the first publicly available database that contains 48,400 patches from real and fake IDs, called FakeIDet-db, together with the experimental framework.

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have enabled effortless image editing via text prompts, raising concerns about image security. Attackers with access to user images can exploit these tools for malicious edits. Recent defenses attempt to protect images by adding a limited noise in the pixel space to disrupt the functioning of diffusion-based editing models. However, the adversarial noise added by previous methods is easily noticeable to the human eye. Moreover, most of these methods are not robust to purification techniques like JPEG compression under a feasible pixel budget. We propose a novel optimization approach that introduces adversarial perturbations directly in the frequency domain by modifying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of the input image. By leveraging the JPEG pipeline, our method generates adversarial images that effectively prevent malicious image editing. Extensive experiments across a variety of tasks and datasets demonstrate that our approach introduces fewer visual artifacts while maintaining similar levels of edit protection and robustness to noise purification techniques.

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of remotely sensed data and the potential of such data to inform large-scale decision-making has driven the development of deep learning models for many Earth Observation tasks. Traditionally, such models must be trained on large datasets. However, the common assumption that broadly larger datasets lead to better outcomes tends to overlook the complexities of the data distribution, the potential for introducing biases and noise, and the computational resources required for processing and storing vast datasets. Therefore, effective solutions should consider both the quantity and quality of data. In this paper, we propose six novel core-set selection methods for selecting important subsets of samples from remote sensing image segmentation datasets that rely on imagery only, labels only, and a combination of each. We benchmark these approaches against a random-selection baseline on three commonly used land cover classification datasets: DFC2022, Vaihingen, and Potsdam. In each of the datasets, we demonstrate that training on a subset of samples outperforms the random baseline, and some approaches outperform training on all available data. This result shows the importance and potential of data-centric learning for the remote sensing domain. The code is available at https://github.com/keillernogueira/data-centric-rs-classification/.

Abstract: Reconstructing a high-quality, animatable 3D human avatar with expressive facial and hand motions from a single image has gained significant attention due to its broad application potential. 3D human avatar reconstruction typically requires multi-view or monocular videos and training on individual IDs, which is both complex and time-consuming. Furthermore, limited by SMPLX's expressiveness, these methods often focus on body motion but struggle with facial expressions. To address these challenges, we first introduce an expressive human model (EHM) to enhance facial expression capabilities and develop an accurate tracking method. Based on this template model, we propose GUAVA, the first framework for fast animatable upper-body 3D Gaussian avatar reconstruction. We leverage inverse texture mapping and projection sampling techniques to infer Ubody (upper-body) Gaussians from a single image. The rendered images are refined through a neural refiner. Experimental results demonstrate that GUAVA significantly outperforms previous methods in rendering quality and offers significant speed improvements, with reconstruction times in the sub-second range (0.1s), and supports real-time animation and rendering.

Abstract: Bilingual text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from bilingual text inputs, holds immense potential for cross-linguistic applications in gaming, film, and robotics. However, this task faces critical challenges: the absence of bilingual motion-language datasets and the misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, leading to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address these challenges, we propose BiHumanML3D, a novel bilingual human motion dataset, which establishes a crucial benchmark for bilingual text-to-motion generation models. Furthermore, we propose a Bilingual Motion Diffusion model (BiMD), which leverages cross-lingual aligned representations to capture semantics, thereby achieving a unified bilingual model. Building upon this, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign) method, comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Assessing human skill levels in complex activities is a challenging problem with applications in sports, rehabilitation, and training. In this work, we present SkillFormer, a parameter-efficient architecture for unified multi-view proficiency estimation from egocentric and exocentric videos. Building on the TimeSformer backbone, SkillFormer introduces a CrossViewFusion module that fuses view-specific features using multi-head cross-attention, learnable gating, and adaptive self-calibration. We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune only a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing training costs. In fact, when evaluated on the EgoExo4D dataset, SkillFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in multi-view settings while demonstrating remarkable computational efficiency, using 4.5x fewer parameters and requiring 3.75x fewer training epochs than prior baselines. It excels in multiple structured tasks, confirming the value of multi-view integration for fine-grained skill assessment.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have been widely tested on tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and grounding, but lack rigorous evaluation for alignment with human-centered (HC) values such as fairness, ethics, and inclusivity. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HumaniBench}, a novel benchmark of 32,000 real-world image-question pairs and an evaluation suite. Labels are generated via an AI-assisted pipeline and validated by experts. HumaniBench assesses LMMs across seven key alignment principles: fairness, ethics, empathy, inclusivity, reasoning, robustness, and multilinguality, through diverse open-ended and closed-ended VQA tasks. Grounded in AI ethics and real-world needs, these principles provide a holistic lens for societal impact. Benchmarking results on different LMM shows that proprietary models generally lead in reasoning, fairness, and multilinguality, while open-source models excel in robustness and grounding. Most models struggle to balance accuracy with ethical and inclusive behavior. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time scaling improve alignment. As the first benchmark tailored for HC alignment, HumaniBench offers a rigorous testbed to diagnose limitations, and promote responsible LMM development. All data and code are publicly available for reproducibility.
  Keywords: HumaniBench, vision-language models, responsible AI benchmark, AI alignment evaluation, AI ethics assessment, fairness in AI models, visual question answering (VQA) benchmark, image captioning evaluation, visual grounding tasks, trustworthy AI models, Chain-of-Thought prompting, test-time scaling, ethical AI development tools.

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-source remote sensing data has propelled the development of deep learning for dense prediction, yet significant challenges in data and task unification persist. Current deep learning architectures for remote sensing are fundamentally rigid. They are engineered for fixed input-output configurations, restricting their adaptability to the heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions inherent in real-world data. Furthermore, these models neglect the intrinsic correlations among semantic segmentation, binary change detection, and semantic change detection, necessitating the development of distinct models or task-specific decoders. This paradigm is also constrained to a predefined set of output semantic classes, where any change to the classes requires costly retraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Unified Network (STSUN) for unified modeling. STSUN can adapt to input and output data with arbitrary spatial sizes, temporal lengths, and spectral bands by leveraging their metadata for a unified representation. Moreover, STSUN unifies disparate dense prediction tasks within a single architecture by conditioning the model on trainable task embeddings. Similarly, STSUN facilitates flexible prediction across multiple set of semantic categories by integrating trainable category embeddings as metadata. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse Spatial-Temporal-Spectral configurations in multiple scenarios demonstrate that a single STSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous inputs and outputs, unifying various dense prediction tasks and diverse semantic class predictions. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces an end-to-end pipeline for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on Urdu newspapers, addressing challenges posed by complex multi-column layouts, low-resolution scans, and the stylistic variability of the Nastaliq script. Our system comprises four modules: (1) article segmentation, (2) image super-resolution, (3) column segmentation, and (4) text recognition. We fine-tune YOLOv11x for segmentation, achieving 0.963 precision for articles and 0.970 for columns. A SwinIR-based super-resolution model boosts LLM text recognition accuracy by 25-70%. We also introduce the Urdu Newspaper Benchmark (UNB), a manually annotated dataset for Urdu OCR. Using UNB and the OpenITI corpus, we compare traditional CNN+RNN-based OCR models with modern LLMs. Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best performance with a WER of 0.133. We further analyze LLM outputs via insertion, deletion, and substitution error breakdowns, as well as character-level confusion analysis. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on just 500 samples yields a 6.13% WER improvement, highlighting the adaptability of LLMs for Urdu OCR.

Abstract: Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the standard architecture in computer vision, their massive sizes lead to significant computational overhead. Token compression techniques have attracted considerable attention to address this issue, but they often suffer from severe information loss, requiring extensive additional training to achieve practical performance. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Token Merging (ATM), a novel method that ensures lossless token merging, eliminating the need for fine-tuning while maintaining competitive performance. ATM adaptively reduces tokens across layers and batches by carefully adjusting layer-specific similarity thresholds, thereby preventing the undesirable merging of less similar tokens with respect to each layer. Furthermore, ATM introduces a novel token matching technique that considers not only similarity but also merging sizes, particularly for the final layers, to minimize the information loss incurred from each merging operation. We empirically validate our method across a wide range of pretrained models, demonstrating that ATM not only outperforms all existing training-free methods but also surpasses most training-intensive approaches, even without additional training. Remarkably, training-free ATM achieves over a 30% reduction in FLOPs for the DeiT-T and DeiT-S models without any drop in their original accuracy.

<title>OpenSeg-R: Improving Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.

Abstract: Occlusion Boundary Estimation (OBE) identifies boundaries arising from both inter-object occlusions and self-occlusion within individual objects, distinguishing them from ordinary edges and semantic contours to support more accurate scene understanding. This task is closely related to Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), which infers depth from a single image, as Occlusion Boundaries (OBs) provide critical geometric cues for resolving depth ambiguities, while depth can conversely refine occlusion reasoning. In this paper, we propose MoDOT, a novel method that jointly estimates depth and OBs from a single image for the first time. MoDOT incorporates a new module, CASM, which combines cross-attention and multi-scale strip convolutions to leverage mid-level OB features for improved depth prediction. It also includes an occlusion-aware loss, OBDCL, which encourages more accurate boundaries in the predicted depth map. Extensive experiments demonstrate the mutual benefits of jointly estimating depth and OBs, and validate the effectiveness of MoDOT's design. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two synthetic datasets and the widely used NYUD-v2 real-world dataset, significantly outperforming multi-task baselines. Furthermore, the cross-domain results of MoDOT on real-world depth prediction - trained solely on our synthetic dataset - yield promising results, preserving sharp OBs in the predicted depth maps and demonstrating improved geometric fidelity compared to competitors. We will release our code, pre-trained models, and dataset at [link].

Abstract: The recent explosive interest in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, such as DeepSeek-R1, has demonstrated remarkable success through reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning frameworks, exemplified by methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, such reasoning abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models, including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose \textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting scenarios.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Unlike existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Depth estimation is crucial for intelligent systems, enabling applications from autonomous navigation to augmented reality. While traditional stereo and active depth sensors have limitations in cost, power, and robustness, dual-pixel (DP) technology, ubiquitous in modern cameras, offers a compelling alternative. This paper introduces DiFuse-Net, a novel modality decoupled network design for disentangled RGB and DP based depth estimation. DiFuse-Net features a window bi-directional parallax attention mechanism (WBiPAM) specifically designed to capture the subtle DP disparity cues unique to smartphone cameras with small aperture. A separate encoder extracts contextual information from the RGB image, and these features are fused to enhance depth prediction. We also propose a Cross-modal Transfer Learning (CmTL) mechanism to utilize large-scale RGB-D datasets in the literature to cope with the limitations of obtaining large-scale RGB-DP-D dataset. Our evaluation and comparison of the proposed method demonstrates its superiority over the DP and stereo-based baseline methods. Additionally, we contribute a new, high-quality, real-world RGB-DP-D training dataset, named Dual-Camera Dual-Pixel (DCDP) dataset, created using our novel symmetric stereo camera hardware setup, stereo calibration and rectification protocol, and AI stereo disparity estimation method.

Abstract: The segmentation of forest LiDAR 3D point clouds, including both individual tree and semantic segmentation, is fundamental for advancing forest management and ecological research. However, current approaches often struggle with the complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise individual tree and semantic segmentation. ForestFormer3D incorporates ISA-guided query point selection, a score-based block merging strategy during inference, and a one-to-many association mechanism for effective training. By combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2 dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally, ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx), showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor modalities. The FOR-instanceV2 dataset and the ForestFormer3D code are publicly available at https://bxiang233.github.io/FF3D/.

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of the complete canopy architecture are essential for accurately evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield performance to guide ideotype design. Although various sensing technologies have been developed for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of individual plants and canopies, they failed to obtain an accurate description of canopy architectures due to severe occlusion among complex canopy architectures. We proposed an effective method for 3D reconstruction of complex, dynamic population canopy architecture for rapeseed crops with a novel point cloud completion model. A complete point cloud generation framework was developed for automated annotation of the training dataset by distinguishing surface points from occluded points within canopies. The crop population point cloud completion network (CP-PCN) was then designed with a multi-resolution dynamic graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and a point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict occluded points. To further enhance feature extraction, a dynamic graph convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) module was proposed to capture structural variations over the whole rapeseed growth period. The results demonstrated that CP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm -4.51 cm over four growth stages, outperforming the state-of-the-art transformer-based method (PoinTr). Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE modules. Moreover, the validation experiment demonstrated that the silique efficiency index developed from CP-PCN improved the overall accuracy of rapeseed yield prediction by 11.2% compared to that of using incomplete point clouds. The CP-PCN pipeline has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly advancing the quantitatively analysis of in-field population canopy architectures.

Abstract: Although interpretable prototype networks have improved the transparency of deep learning image classification, the need for multiple prototypes in collaborative decision-making increases cognitive complexity and hinders user understanding. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel interpretable deep architecture for image classification, called ProtoSolo. Unlike existing prototypical networks, ProtoSolo requires activation of only a single prototype to complete the classification. This design significantly simplifies interpretation, as the explanation for each class requires displaying only the prototype with the highest similarity score and its corresponding feature map. Additionally, the traditional full-channel feature vector is replaced with a feature map for similarity comparison and prototype learning, enabling the use of richer global information within a single-prototype activation decision. A non-projection prototype learning strategy is also introduced to preserve the association between the prototype and image patch while avoiding abrupt structural changes in the network caused by projection, which can affect classification performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrate that ProtoSolo matches state-of-the-art interpretable methods in classification accuracy while achieving the lowest cognitive complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/pyt19/ProtoSolo.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing, leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning (CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-instance feature association constitutes a crucial step in 3D reconstruction, facilitating the consistent grouping of object instances across various camera perspectives. The presence of multiple identical objects within a scene often leads to ambiguities for appearance-based feature matching algorithms. Our work circumvents this challenge by exclusively employing geometrical constraints, specifically epipolar geometry, for feature association. We introduce C-DOG (Connected delta-Overlap Graph), an algorithm designed for robust geometrical feature association, even in the presence of noisy feature detections. In a C-DOG graph, two nodes representing 2D feature points from distinct views are connected by an edge if they correspond to the same 3D point. Each edge is weighted by its epipolar distance. Ideally, true associations yield a zero distance; however, noisy feature detections can result in non-zero values. To robustly retain edges where the epipolar distance is less than a threshold delta, we employ a Szymkiewicz--Simpson coefficient. This process leads to a delta-neighbor-overlap clustering of 2D nodes. Furthermore, unreliable nodes are pruned from these clusters using an Inter-quartile Range (IQR)-based criterion. Our extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG not only outperforms geometry-based baseline algorithms but also remains remarkably robust under demanding conditions. This includes scenes with high object density, no visual features, and restricted camera overlap, positioning C-DOG as an excellent solution for scalable 3D reconstruction in practical applications.

Abstract: The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets. This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper. In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance. More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for pan-sharpening.

Abstract: Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored, high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models, rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our GitHub repository.

Abstract: Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase, one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is available at https://github.com/pq-chen/CasP.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely adopted privacy-preserving machine learning approach where private data remains local, enabling secure computations and the exchange of local model gradients between local clients and third-party parameter servers. However, recent findings reveal that privacy may be compromised and sensitive information potentially recovered from shared gradients. In this study, we offer detailed analysis and a novel perspective on understanding the gradient leakage problem. These theoretical works lead to a new gradient leakage defense technique that secures arbitrary model architectures using a private key-lock module. Only the locked gradient is transmitted to the parameter server for global model aggregation. Our proposed learning method is resistant to gradient leakage attacks, and the key-lock module is designed and trained to ensure that, without the private information of the key-lock module: a) reconstructing private training data from the shared gradient is infeasible; and b) the global model's inference performance is significantly compromised. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of why gradients can leak private information and provide theoretical proof of our method's effectiveness. We conducted extensive empirical evaluations with many models on several popular benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach in both maintaining model performance and defending against gradient leakage attacks.

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient fine-tuning method for large pre-trained models, offering strong in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Breaking away from traditional practices that need a multitude of fine-tuned models for averaging, our approach employs significantly fewer models to achieve final weights yet yield superior accuracy. Drawing from key insights in the weight space of fine-tuned weights, we uncover a strong link between the performance and proximity to the center of weight space. Based on this, we introduce a method that approximates a center-close weight using only two fine-tuned models, applicable during or after training. Our innovative layer-wise weight averaging technique surpasses state-of-the-art model methods such as Model Soup, utilizing only two fine-tuned models. This strategy can be aptly coined Model Stock, highlighting its reliance on selecting a minimal number of models to draw a more optimized-averaged model. We demonstrate the efficacy of Model Stock with fine-tuned models based upon pre-trained CLIP architectures, achieving remarkable performance on both ID and OOD tasks on the standard benchmarks, all while barely bringing extra computational demands. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/naver-ai/model-stock.

Abstract: Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) has become indispensable in modern healthcare, enhancing clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment. Despite the remarkable advancements supported by deep learning (DL) technologies, their practical deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts, where models trained on specific datasets underperform across others from varying hospitals, regions, or patient populations. To navigate this issue, researchers have been actively developing strategies to increase the adaptability and robustness of DL models, enabling their effective use in unfamiliar and diverse environments. This paper systematically reviews approaches that apply DL techniques to MedIA systems affected by distribution shifts. Unlike traditional categorizations based on technical specifications, our approach is grounded in the real-world operational constraints faced by healthcare institutions. Specifically, we categorize the existing body of work into Joint Training, Federated Learning, Fine-tuning, and Domain Generalization, with each method tailored to distinct scenarios caused by Data Accessibility, Privacy Concerns, and Collaborative Protocols. This perspective equips researchers with a nuanced understanding of how DL can be strategically deployed to address distribution shifts in MedIA, ensuring diverse and robust medical applications. By delving deeper into these topics, we highlight potential pathways for future research that not only address existing limitations but also push the boundaries of deployable MedIA technologies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.

arXiv:2506.18725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and localization. Extracting a meaningful global descriptor from a query point cloud that can be matched with the descriptors of the database point clouds is a challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we propose a novel methodology, named TopoRec, which utilizes Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for extracting local descriptors from a point cloud, thereby eliminating the need for resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. To test the quality of the proposed TopoRec technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford RobotCar, NCLT) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for large-scale place and object recognition, respectively. Unlike existing learning-based approaches such as PointNetVLAD and PCAN, our method does not require extensive training, making it easily adaptable to new environments. Despite this, it consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art learning-based and handcrafted baselines (e.g., M2DP, ScanContext) on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy and strong generalization.

The framework enables accurate depth estimation with fine-grained details without the need for synthetic datasets, making it a valuable addition to the field of depth estimation. 

<br /><br />Summary: Zero-shot depth estimation models can face challenges with high-resolution images, but the proposed Patch Refine Once (PRO) framework offers a solution. By utilizing Grouped Patch Consistency Training and Bias Free Masking, PRO enhances efficiency, mitigates depth discontinuity issues, and improves generalizability to real-world datasets.

Abstract: Zero-shot depth estimation (DE) models exhibit strong generalization performance as they are trained on large-scale datasets. However, existing models struggle with high-resolution images due to the discrepancy in image resolutions of training (with smaller resolutions) and inference (for high resolutions). Processing them at full resolution leads to decreased estimation accuracy on depth with tremendous memory consumption, while downsampling to the training resolution results in blurred edges in the estimated depth images. Prevailing high-resolution depth estimation methods adopt a patch-based approach, which introduces depth discontinuity issues when reassembling the estimated depth patches, resulting in test-time inefficiency. Additionally, to obtain fine-grained depth details, these methods rely on synthetic datasets due to the real-world sparse ground truth depth, leading to poor generalizability. To tackle these limitations, we propose Patch Refine Once (PRO), an efficient and generalizable tile-based framework. Our PRO consists of two key components: (i) Grouped Patch Consistency Training that enhances test-time efficiency while mitigating the depth discontinuity problem by jointly processing four overlapping patches and enforcing a consistency loss on their overlapping regions within a single backpropagation step, and (ii) Bias Free Masking that prevents the DE models from overfitting to dataset-specific biases, enabling better generalization to real-world datasets even after training on synthetic data. Zero-shot evaluations on Booster, ETH3D, Middlebury 2014, and NuScenes demonstrate that our PRO can be seamlessly integrated into existing depth estimation models.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic 4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core, MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior 4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D generation from minimal inputs.

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems, and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation, allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

arXiv:2507.23027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR) techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs. Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet, which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

This approach allows for scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps, leading to a 64% reduction in inference time steps and a 61.55% decrease in running power consumption. The method is evaluated across diverse datasets and demonstrates promising results in maintaining rendering fidelity while improving efficiency in resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing. <div>
arXiv:2507.23033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process. Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running power by 61.55\%.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous vehicles, NovaDrive, vision-language architecture, real-time inference, safety

Summary:
Autonomous vehicles face the challenge of quick decision-making while navigating complex environments. NovaDrive, a vision-language architecture, combines front-camera images, HD map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. It utilizes a two-stage cross-attention block to align waypoint tokens with the HD map and refine attention over image and depth patches, eliminating the need for recurrent memory. By fine-tuning top layers of a vision-language backbone, NovaDrive achieves real-time inference and improves success rate, path efficiency, and collision frequency on benchmark tests. Waypoint tokens, partial fine-tuning, and cross-attention fusion are key contributors to these performance gains. Additionally, the implementation of a smoothness loss results in shorter routes and potential fuel or battery savings. NovaDrive's advancements not only enhance safety but also pave the way for leaner and more easily updatable driving systems. This architecture holds promise for extending its applications to other smart AI domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

Summary: 
The article introduces two innovative synthetic data generation methods - MObI for autonomous driving and AnydoorMed for medical image analysis. MObI is a framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that utilizes a diffusion model to realistically insert objects into existing scenes for autonomous driving, ensuring semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. AnydoorMed extends this approach to medical imaging, focusing on inpainting anomalies in mammography scans while preserving structural integrity and blending with surrounding tissue. Both methods leverage reference guidance and 3D bounding box conditioning to ensure accurate positioning and realistic scaling. These techniques demonstrate the adaptability of foundation models for reference-guided inpainting across diverse perceptual modalities, enabling the construction of highly realistic, controllable, and multimodal scenarios for safety-critical applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation, maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

Summary:
XYZ-Drive is a vision-language model designed for autonomous driving that integrates geometric accuracy and semantic understanding. It utilizes a lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer to allow waypoint tokens to highlight relevant image and map patches, improving action and textual explanations. The model achieves high success rates and efficiency on the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark, surpassing previous approaches. Ablation studies confirm the importance of integrating vision, waypoint, and map modalities, as well as the effectiveness of goal-centered attention for map knowledge fusion. Fine-tuning the transformer is crucial for task-specific performance improvement, with frozen models showing reduced success. Additionally, maintaining high map resolution is essential for accurately detecting lane edges and reducing collision rates. Overall, XYZ-Drive demonstrates the efficacy of early, token-level fusion for enabling transparent, real-time autonomous driving.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Summary:
Fine-grained image classification poses challenges in distinguishing visually similar subcategories without predefined class labels. Traditional approaches are limited in scalability and adaptability. To address this, a training-free method called Enriched-FineR (E-FineR) combines large language and vision-language models for open-set recognition and achieves state-of-the-art results. E-FineR offers interpretability and is suitable for scenarios where expert annotations are scarce. It demonstrates performance in zero-shot and few-shot classification without human interventions. The framework supports flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable and generalizable systems for real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species, car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem. Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method, Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

<div> Keywords: OV-3DIS, VLMs, Alpha-CLIP, SMS score, 3D tracking

Summary:
Our proposed state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) combines various complementary concepts to tackle key challenges. We adopt a two-stage approach involving 3D proposal generation and instance classification. By utilizing robust 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation and iterative merging/removal techniques, we enhance proposal quality. In the classification stage, we introduce Alpha-CLIP, incorporating object masks to improve object-centric representation and reduce background noise. The standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score is introduced to normalize text-to-proposal similarity, effectively eliminating false positives and improving precision. Our framework outperforms existing methods on ScanNet200 and S3DIS datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. Our approach even surpasses end-to-end closed-vocabulary methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed recipe for OV-3DIS.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary method.

<div> identity leakage, facial animation, zero-shot, diffusion-based, portrait

Summary:
X-NeMo is a new zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation system that can animate a static portrait using facial movements from a different individual in a driving video. The system addresses previous issues like identity leakage and difficulty in capturing subtle and extreme expressions by using a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from the driving image. This descriptor controls motion through cross-attention during image generation, capturing expressive facial motion in fine detail. The system learns from a diverse video dataset without relying on pretrained motion detectors. By embedding the driving motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion through cross-attention, X-NeMo eliminates identity leakage. Supervision of learning with a dual GAN decoder further enhances expressiveness and disentangles motion latents from identity cues, resulting in highly expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. The code and models for X-NeMo are available for research.

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail, learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models are available for research.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel neural inverse rendering approach that can reconstruct geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from multi-view images captured under different lighting directions. Unlike previous methods, this approach does not require light calibration or per-view normal maps. Instead, it jointly optimizes all scene parameters in a single stage using raw images. By representing geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and applying shadow-aware volume rendering, the proposed method achieves superior accuracy in shape and lighting estimation compared to state-of-the-art techniques. It also demonstrates robustness in handling objects with complex geometry and reflectance properties, as well as generalizes well to view-unaligned multi-light images. <div>

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality. However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion -- within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16% improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for advancing motion acquisition.

<div> adversarial image, diffusion model, multimodal large language models, adversarial-guided noise, defense<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) approach to generate adversarial images that deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) while minimizing distortion. Unlike traditional attacks, AGD injects target semantics into the noise component of a diffusion model, ensuring attack efficacy. The full-spectrum property of the noise in AGD makes it robust to defenses that target specific frequency bands. By combining clean images with noise during reverse diffusion, AGD produces adversarial images that are challenging to suppress using common defenses. Experimental results demonstrate that AGD surpasses existing methods in attack performance and model robustness against certain defenses. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property. Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as in model robustness to some defenses.

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated instances.

Summary:<br />
Road damage detection is crucial for traffic safety and infrastructure maintenance. Existing deep learning methods face challenges in accurately detecting small-scale damages and high computational demands. To address this, a new model called YOLO-ROC is proposed, combining a BMS-SPPF module for multi-scale feature extraction and a hierarchical channel compression strategy for efficiency. YOLO-ROC achieved a mAP50 of 67.6% on the RDD2022_China_Drone dataset, surpassing YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Improvements were seen in detecting small targets, with a 16.8% increase in mAP50 for the D40 category. The model size was reduced to only 2.0 MB while maintaining high performance. YOLO-ROC also demonstrated strong generalization on the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets. Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from 3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of 67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only 2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Summary: 
Augmented reality (AR) is becoming more prevalent in daily life, emphasizing the need for ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of virtual content. This research focuses on detecting task-detrimental AR content that hinders critical information or distorts user perception. Two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, were developed using vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules to identify such attacks. The study proposes three future directions: automated evaluation of virtual content quality aligned with perception, detection of multimodal attacks, and optimization of VLMs for efficient deployment on AR devices. The overall goal is to establish a scalable framework that prioritizes human-centered protection of AR experiences. Feedback is sought on perceptual modeling, implementing multimodal AR content, and adapting lightweight models for user-centric deployment. <div>

Summary:<br />
Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to help models learn new concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes. The research on Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL) has introduced the concept of leveraging unlabeled samples to improve learning. However, existing approaches only consider unlabeled data from novel classes of the current session, limiting their practicality. To address this, Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) incorporates both base and novel classes in the unlabeled set. This new approach presents a challenge for existing methods in distinguishing between base and novel class samples. The proposed Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy dynamically corrects biased feature distributions using base samples for few-shot novel classes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ALDC outperforms existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes. Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However, these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

RL-QR enhances retrieval performance for text-only and multi-modal databases, with a notable 11% relative gain in NDCG@3 for multi-modal RAG with RL-QR_multi-modal. However, challenges still exist in semantic and hybrid retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance due to training misalignments. RL-QR shows promise in revolutionizing query optimization for RAG systems, offering an annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while also highlighting areas for further improvement in semantic retrieval contexts. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse, unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce \textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house data demonstrate significant improvements, with $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3 for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable, annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

<div> Keywords: Cranial nerves, diffusion MRI, fiber tractography, atlas, automated mapping

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to creating a comprehensive atlas for mapping cranial nerve (CN) pathways in the human brain using diffusion MRI. By utilizing multi-parametric fiber tractography and a multi-stage fiber clustering strategy, the CN atlas accurately identifies 8 fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs. Through quantitative and visual experiments on datasets from the Human Connectome Project, Multi-shell Diffusion MRI, and clinical cases, the atlas demonstrates high spatial correspondence with manual annotations. The automated mapping provided by this atlas enhances the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures, offering valuable insights into the spatial relationships between CNs and surrounding anatomy. This work contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient and detailed mapping of CN pathways, potentially aiding in preoperative planning and neurosurgical interventions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8 fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II, oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers, discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods.

<div> Keywords: Time Series forecasting, Geometric Structure Index, Shape-Aware Temporal Loss, first-order difference loss, frequency domain loss

Summary:
The study introduces a novel evaluation metric, the Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), to assess the geometric structure of time series data. To address the non-differentiability issue, a Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL) is proposed, comprising three components: first-order difference loss, frequency domain loss, and perceptual feature loss. The SATL aims to enhance structure modeling during training without increasing computational cost during inference. Experimental results on various datasets show that models trained with SATL outperform baseline methods in terms of both mean squared error (MSE) and TGSI metrics. The proposed method effectively leverages the inherent two-dimensional geometric representations of time series data, demonstrating its potential for improving forecasting accuracy across different domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Introduction of Geometric Structure Index (TGSI) for evaluating temporal dynamics.
- Proposal of Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL) to bridge the non-differentiability gap.
- SATL combines three components to enhance structure modeling during training.
- Experimental results show superior performance of SATL-trained models in MSE and TGSI compared to baselines.
- Potential for improved forecasting accuracy in diverse domains. <div>
arXiv:2507.23253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data, which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training. SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

<div> Keywords: Multi-label image recognition, partial labels, Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning, score distribution, performance improvement

Summary:
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm is proposed for Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL). SATL calculates score distributions for positive and negative samples in each category to dynamically determine category-specific thresholds. The thresholds are continuously updated during the learning process. A differential ranking loss is utilized to enhance discrimination between score distributions of positive and negative samples. The method significantly improves performance in scenarios with limited labels, as demonstrated through experiments on large-scale multi-label datasets like Microsoft COCO and VG-200. This novel approach overcomes inaccuracies and incompleteness in pseudo-labels commonly caused by fixed thresholds based on semantic or feature correlations. The dynamic nature of SATL ensures more accurate and effective training with varying score distributions across categories. <div>
arXiv:2507.23263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets, such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

Summary:
PixelNerd introduces a novel approach to image generation by modeling patch-wise decoding using neural field representation. This single-scale, single-stage, end-to-end solution eliminates the need for complex cascade pipelines and variational autoencoders (VAEs), reducing errors and decoding artifacts. The efficient neural field representation in PixelNerd achieves impressive FID scores of 2.15 on ImageNet 256x256 and 2.84 on ImageNet 512x512. Additionally, the framework is extended to text-to-image applications, where PixNerd-XXL/16 performs competitively on both the GenEval and DPG benchmarks. This innovative approach opens the door for more efficient and effective image generation techniques without relying on traditional VAE-based methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE). However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems, researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale, single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16 achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9 overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Summary: 
- The study explores the use of SAM2 for low-cost and minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI.
- Three different slice-wise tracking strategies were tested, with center-outward propagation showing the best results in consistency and accuracy.
- Despite not being specifically trained for medical data, SAM2 demonstrated strong segmentation performance with minimal supervision.
- The analysis revealed how segmentation performance varies based on tumor size, location, and shape, highlighting key failure modes.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs, proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost, minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2 can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

- iLRM employs a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs and iteratively refines 3D Gaussian representations for high-fidelity reconstruction.

arXiv:2507.23277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger number of input views.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces UniLIP, an extension of CLIP that enhances its capabilities in tasks such as reconstruction, generation, and editing. Previous methods relied on additional components like diffusion decoders or quantization, leading to inconsistent results. UniLIP adopts a two-stage training scheme and self-distillation to integrate reconstruction abilities without compromising comprehension performance. A dual-condition architecture connects MLLM and diffusion transformer, leveraging both for improved performance. In text-to-image generation tasks, UniLIP outperforms existing unified models. In image editing, UniLIP achieves a high score on the ImgEdit Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models. Overall, UniLIP expands CLIP's application range, demonstrating its effectiveness in understanding, generation, and editing tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction, generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain original comprehension performance while achieving effective image reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks, UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Summary: 
The study introduces a new framework called Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM) for Text-Video Retrieval, addressing the issue of candidate prior bias in retrieval models. BLiM leverages both query and candidate likelihoods to enhance relevance between text and video queries. The model is trained to generate text from video and video features from text. Additionally, Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN) is introduced to mitigate candidate prior bias without the need for training. Performance evaluation on four benchmarks shows that BLiM with CPN outperforms existing state-of-the-art models by 6.4 in R@1 on average, emphasizing query-candidate relevance and reducing bias towards candidates with higher inherent priors. The study also demonstrates the broad applicability of CPN in various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval, enhancing visual understanding and reducing reliance on textual priors.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However, despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap, are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible through traditional metrics.

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach for geometric image editing that involves repositioning, reorienting, or reshaping objects within an image while maintaining scene coherence. The proposed method utilizes a decoupled pipeline, separating object transformation, source region inpainting, and target region refinement. It makes use of a training-free diffusion approach called FreeFine for both inpainting and refinement. The experiments conducted on the GeoBench benchmark, which includes 2D and 3D editing scenarios, show that FreeFine outperforms existing methods in terms of image fidelity and edit precision, especially when dealing with challenging transformations. The code and benchmark for this approach are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit precision, especially under demanding transformations.

<br />
Summary:<br />
ST-SAM introduces a novel approach to Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) that overcomes limitations of existing methods. It utilizes Self-Training to filter and expand high-confidence pseudo-labels dynamically, enhancing a single-model architecture to avoid prediction bias and error propagation. By transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts, ST-SAM leverages the Segment Anything Model's domain-specific knowledge to reduce error accumulation in self-training. Experimental results demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% labeled data, surpassing existing SSCOD methods and rivaling fully supervised techniques. Notably, ST-SAM requires training a single network, offering high efficiency without specific model dependencies or loss functions. This work introduces a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD, providing a scalable and computationally economical solution for object detection tasks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.23307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically, ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training. Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

Summary:
The article introduces PriorFusion, a framework for enhancing road element perception in autonomous driving scenarios. It effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors to improve accuracy and reliability. The framework includes an instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features and a data-driven shape template space for encoding low-dimensional representations of road elements. This enables clustering to generate anchor points as reference priors. A diffusion-based framework leverages these prior anchors to generate accurate predictions. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate significant improvements in perception accuracy, particularly in challenging conditions. Visualization results confirm that the approach produces more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements. <div>

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements. A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

<div> Keywords: linear merging, models, continual learning, computer vision, incremental training

Summary: 
Linear merging of models in continual learning was investigated in this paper using controlled visual cues in computer vision experiments. The study showed that merging models largely preserves or enhances shared knowledge, while task-specific knowledge that is not shared degrades rapidly. The research also found that merging models from an incremental training process consistently outperformed models trained in parallel. This suggests that the sequential acquisition of knowledge through continuous learning is more effective in merging models. The results highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of model integration in continual learning settings, particularly in the context of computer vision tasks. The study provides valuable insights into the benefits of merging models to maintain and enhance shared knowledge while leveraging task-specific knowledge effectively in a continual learning framework.

<div> Transformer-based text-to-image diffusion models, content-style separation, artistic prompts, cross-attention heatmaps, large-scale generative models

Summary:
The paper explores how transformer-based text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts, specifically in generating artworks. By using cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels in generated images to specific prompt tokens, the study reveals varying degrees of content-style separation. It found that in many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related regions, while style tokens affect background and texture areas. This suggests an emergent understanding of the content-style distinction within the models. The research sheds light on how these large-scale generative models internally represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. The code, dataset, and an exploratory tool for visualizing attention maps are shared for further research and understanding at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation, regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed, while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80% Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines.

Summary:
FastDriveVLA introduces a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework, ReconPruner, specifically designed for autonomous driving. The framework prioritizes foreground information crucial for decision-making in driving scenarios. A new adversarial reconstruction strategy is employed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. This approach enables seamless application to different VLA models without retraining. The model is trained on nuScenes-FG, a large-scale dataset containing annotated foreground regions in image-mask pairs. FastDriveVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across various pruning ratios. <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.

Summary:
FASTopoWM is a novel lane segment topology reasoning framework that leverages fast-slow architecture and latent world models. It effectively incorporates temporal cues to enhance detection and reasoning performance in autonomous driving systems. By parallel supervision of historical and newly initialized queries, it reduces the impact of pose estimation failures and improves temporal propagation. The introduction of latent world models conditioned on action latent enhances state representations from past observations to the current timestep, leading to significant improvements in temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Experimental results on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark show that FASTopoWM outperforms existing methods in lane segment detection and centerline perception, achieving higher mAP and OLS scores. <div>
arXiv:2507.23325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV) road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).

Experimental results on public multi-center benchmarks demonstrate the framework's superiority over existing domain generalization approaches, showcasing robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse clinical domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency. Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches, achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse clinical domains.

<div> Keywords: Traffic sign recognition, autonomous driving, long-tail distribution, multi-scale features, multimodal contrastive learning

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel two-stage framework for traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving systems. The proposed method addresses the challenges posed by the long-tail distribution of traffic sign datasets and the presence of small, multi-scale targets in real-world scenarios. The first stage of the framework utilizes a NanoVerse YOLO model with a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network and an SPD-Conv module for effective traffic sign detection. In the second stage, a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model is employed for traffic sign classification. By combining visual and semantic features through Vision Transformer and rule-based BERT, the model learns robust representations that are independent of class frequency, reducing confusion caused by data imbalance. Experimental results on the TT100K dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in long-tail detection tasks and outperform mainstream algorithms in terms of accuracy and generalization in complex environments.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first, the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution, resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel framework for road surface reconstruction to support autonomous driving in complex urban settings. The method combines occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to achieve accurate and visually consistent reconstructions. By utilizing planar-adapted Gaussian representation, the framework efficiently models large-scale road surfaces. Additionally, segmentation-guided video inpainting is employed to remove both dynamic and static foreground objects, enhancing the overall reconstruction quality. Color coherence is improved through semantic-aware correction in HSV space, resulting in visually coherent and geometrically accurate reconstructions. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework compared to existing methods, particularly under real-world conditions. <div>

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions, they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction. However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12 exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models suitable for varying operational constraints.

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers" because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I) models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at https://github.com/zyj-2000/Talker.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

<div> Keywords: large vision-language models, layer pruning, multi-modal understanding, feature gaps, Short-LVLM

Summary:
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multi-modal understanding, but their practical applications are hindered by high computational costs. Existing layer pruning techniques from natural language processing are ineffective when directly applied to LVLMs due to modality divergence and inter-layer feature gaps. In this paper, a novel framework called Short-LVLM (SVL) is proposed to address these challenges. SVL leverages important vision-language tokens and mitigates feature gaps, resulting in a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, SVL is training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible. The framework demonstrates several potential advantages and the code is publicly available for further research and development.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

<div> Transformer, Mamba, VMatcher, feature matching, image pairs  
Summary:  
VMatcher introduces a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for semi-dense feature matching in images. Learning-based methods for feature matching rely heavily on the Transformer's attention mechanism, which can be computationally expensive due to its quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba utilizes a Selective State-Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity for efficiency gains. VMatcher combines Mamba's efficient processing with the Transformer's attention mechanism, offering various configurations, including hierarchical architectures, to set new benchmarks effectively. The proposed approach ensures robustness and practicality for real-time applications, where rapid inference is essential. The source code for VMatcher is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper introduces UniEmo, a unified framework that integrates emotional understanding and generation tasks. It proposes a hierarchical emotional understanding chain with learnable expert queries to extract multi-scale emotional features. The model fuses expert queries and emotional representations to guide the generation of emotion-evoking images, enhancing diversity and fidelity through emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss. Joint training allows implicit feedback between generation and understanding components. A data filtering algorithm selects high-quality emotional images for further training. These dual feedback processes improve the model's understanding capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniEmo's superior performance in emotional understanding and generation tasks. The code is available at the provided Github repository. <div>

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks, yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification. Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/UniEmo.

<div> progressive alignment strategy, CLIP, unsupervised domain adaptation, feature learning, MP^2A

Summary:
The article introduces MP^2A, a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled downstream tasks in unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios. The method aims to address the challenges of aligning source and target domains by gradually incorporating challenging samples as training progresses. By starting with a high-confidence subset of target samples, the model learns a well-aligned representation from reliable data, then refines its understanding without being overwhelmed by label noise. This approach mitigates confirmation bias and promotes robust convergence, enabling the learning of genuinely domain-invariant features. Experiment results on ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and DomainNet benchmarks show that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to recent CLIP-based multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization. State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features. However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

arXiv:2507.23374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization, limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene representation.

<title>AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23402</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a promising direction in representation learning. However, current vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation, we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations. Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

<title>Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging via Diffusion Trajectories</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently, and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable computer-aided diagnosis.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

<title>Beyond Linear Bottlenecks: Spline-Based Knowledge Distillation for Culturally Diverse Art Style Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate, often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds, leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

<title>Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network</title>

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS), the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However, a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1) spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

<title>Mitigating Resolution-Drift in Federated Learning: Case of Keypoint Detection</title>

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks. However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs (teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks that rely on preserving spatial detail.

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only 35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of 3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1. Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10% across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based acceleration technique that leverages the predictable distance trend between sampled points during farthest point sampling. By predicting the distance curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured 3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner, but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a 3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and real-captured patterns. Project page: https://mutianxu.github.io/stable-sim2real/.

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations. This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass. Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU) scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Accurate image registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However, existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's `concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels, we identify that different architectures have statistically different concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct classifications.

<title>ART: Adaptive Relation Tuning for Generalized Relation Prediction</title>

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained. While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations. We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD). We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed 3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at royyang0714.github.io/3D-MOOD.

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail, we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively. To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with fewer parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/zhuyaoye/MamV2XCalib.

<title>MoGA: 3D Generative Avatar Prior for Monocular Gaussian Avatar Reconstruction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism. Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views; however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations, we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior, ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting, enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<title>Mamba-based Efficient Spatio-Frequency Motion Perception for Video Camouflaged Object Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23601</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.23601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage. However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase, we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design, implementation, results, and lessons learned.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image (I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps, enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward (FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and 75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation. Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used, enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves 2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution. Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA, WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/vita-epfl/omnitraj

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal training examples. Our approach enables seamless integration of datasets with different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for hyperspectral medical image analysis.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views. To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%, 34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code will be released.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering (VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian trajectories.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections. For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions. However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code is available at https://github.com/wudongming97/AffordanceNet.

arXiv:2507.23755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning (OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors, termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities. OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally, mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/DIAS.

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents. Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens, guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

arXiv:2507.23778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result, kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics. Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating physical interactions

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents (CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training. Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures, not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other perception tasks.

arXiv:2507.23782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild. In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations, we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on https://github.com/ImNotPrepared/MonoFusion.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33 bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models, contributing to the development of more robust methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting, and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space. Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both quantitively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs' hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale, as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions, adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs) for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential of foundation models in structured data editing tasks.

<title>Planning for Cooler Cities: A Multimodal AI Framework for Predicting and Mitigating Urban Heat Stress through Urban Landscape Transformation</title>

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization, cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C, while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable, fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban environments.

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification. Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

<title>Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence) models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them. Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly, surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast. State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii) cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63% Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at https://pancreasdg.netlify.app.

Abstract: We introduce MRpro, an open-source image reconstruction package built upon PyTorch and open data formats. The framework comprises three main areas. First, it provides unified data structures for the consistent manipulation of MR datasets and their associated metadata (e.g., k-space trajectories). Second, it offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common trajectories and an extended phase graph simulation for quantitative MR. These components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro across multiple applications, including Cartesian, radial, and spiral acquisitions; motion-corrected reconstruction; cardiac MR fingerprinting; learned spatially adaptive regularization weights; model-based learned image reconstruction and quantitative parameter estimation. MRpro offers an extensible framework for MR image reconstruction. With reproducibility and maintainability at its core, it facilitates collaborative development and provides a foundation for future MR imaging research.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key considerations for future advancements in the field.

<title>FuseTen: A Generative Model for Daily 10 m Land Surface Temperature Estimation from Spatio-Temporal Satellite Observations</title>

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use, Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout", tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences, and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10 participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the physical world.

<title>Learning Arbitrary-Scale RAW Image Downscaling with Wavelet-based Recurrent Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution (LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/RenYangSCU/ASRD.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems. This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse 2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping, conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges. LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First, we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions. Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally, recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction. Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in neuronal topology reconstruction.

<title>MPCC: A Novel Benchmark for Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios. Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore, camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce- dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31 {\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as monotonicity, of the model.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms, standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing source coding's protocol. Our source code is available at https://github.com/WooKyoungHan/JPNeO.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge: the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data, and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions. Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments, single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary (Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations, generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines, achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex, open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures, limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion (cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning. The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX estimation.

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts. Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns. Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive, artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early intervention.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work, we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance. These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712), cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome imputation.

<title>Topology Optimization in Medical Image Segmentation with Fast Euler Characteristic</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces. In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology (PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and 3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA, performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at https://github.com/justinkay/coda.

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight, multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will be released.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of objects in visual perception in the absence of any semantic annotation. The resulting model has received no supervision, does not use any pre-trained features, and yet it can segment the domain of an image into multiple independently moving regions. The resulting motion segmentation method can handle an unknown and varying number of objects in real-time. The core multi-modal conditional encoder-decoder architecture has one modality (optical flow) feed the encoder to produce a collection of latent codes (slots), and the other modality (color image) conditions the decoder to generate the first modality (flow) from the slots. The training criterion is designed to foster 'information separation' among the slots, while the architecture explicitly allocates activations to individual slots, leading to a method we call Divided Attention (DivA). At test time, DivA handles a different number of objects and different image resolution than seen at training, and is invariant to permutations of the slots. DivA achieves state-of-the-art performance while tripling the runtime speed of comparable methods, up to 104 FPS, and reduces the performance gap from supervised methods to 12% or less. Objects bootstrapped by DivA can then be used to prime static classifiers via contrastive learning. On fewer than 5,000 video clips, training DINO on DivA's object proposals narrows the performance gap to ImageNet-based training by up to 30.2% compared to training directly on the video frames.

Abstract: Replay-based methods in class-incremental learning (CIL) have attained remarkable success. Despite their effectiveness, the inherent memory restriction results in saving a limited number of exemplars with poor diversity. In this paper, we introduce PESCR, a novel approach that substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars based on a pre-trained general-purpose diffusion model, without fine-tuning it on target datasets or storing it in the memory buffer. Images are compressed into visual and textual prompts, which are saved instead of the original images, decreasing memory consumption by a factor of 24. In subsequent phases, diverse exemplars are regenerated by the diffusion model. We further propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation to minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images. PESCR significantly improves CIL performance across multiple benchmarks, e.g., 3.2% above the previous state-of-the-art on ImageNet-100.

Abstract: Optical coherence Doppler tomography (ODT) is an emerging blood flow imaging technique. The fundamental unit of ODT is the 1D depth-resolved trace named raw A-scans (or A-line). A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is formed by reconstructing a cross-sectional flow image via Doppler phase-subtraction of raw A-scans along B-line. To obtain a high-fidelity B-scan, densely sampled A-scans are required currently, leading to prolonged scanning time and increased storage demands. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel sparse ODT reconstruction framework with an Alternative State Space Attention Network (ASSAN) that effectively reduces raw A-scans needed. Inspired by the distinct distributions of information along A-line and B-line, ASSAN applies 1D State Space Model (SSM) to each A-line to learn the intra-A-scan representation, while using 1D gated self-attention along B-line to capture the inter-A-scan features. In addition, an effective feedforward network based on sequential 1D convolutions along different axes is employed to enhance the local feature. In validation experiments on real animal data, ASSAN shows clear effectiveness in the reconstruction in comparison with state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI) remains a crucial aspect for fostering trust and understanding in machine learning models. Current visual explanation techniques, such as gradient-based or class-activation-based methods, often exhibit a strong dependence on specific model architectures. Conversely, perturbation-based methods, despite being model-agnostic, are computationally expensive as they require evaluating models on a large number of forward passes. In this work, we introduce Foveation-based Explanations (FovEx), a novel XAI method inspired by human vision. FovEx seamlessly integrates biologically inspired perturbations by iteratively creating foveated renderings of the image and combines them with gradient-based visual explorations to determine locations of interest efficiently. These locations are selected to maximize the performance of the model to be explained with respect to the downstream task and then combined to generate an attribution map. We provide a thorough evaluation with qualitative and quantitative assessments on established benchmarks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both transformers (on 4 out of 5 metrics) and convolutional models (on 3 out of 5 metrics), demonstrating its versatility among various architectures. Furthermore, we show the alignment between the explanation map produced by FovEx and human gaze patterns (+14\% in NSS compared to RISE, +203\% in NSS compared to GradCAM). This comparison enhances our confidence in FovEx's ability to close the interpretation gap between humans and machines.

<title>SDFit: 3D Object Pose and Shape by Fitting a Morphable SDF to a Single Image</title>

Abstract: Recovering 3D object pose and shape from a single image is a challenging and ill-posed problem. This is due to strong (self-)occlusions, depth ambiguities, the vast intra- and inter-class shape variance, and the lack of 3D ground truth for natural images. Existing deep-network methods are trained on synthetic datasets to predict 3D shapes, so they often struggle generalizing to real-world images. Moreover, they lack an explicit feedback loop for refining noisy estimates, and primarily focus on geometry without directly considering pixel alignment. To tackle these limitations, we develop a novel render-and-compare optimization framework, called SDFit. This has three key innovations: First, it uses a learned category-specific and morphable signed-distance-function (mSDF) model, and fits this to an image by iteratively refining both 3D pose and shape. The mSDF robustifies inference by constraining the search on the manifold of valid shapes, while allowing for arbitrary shape topologies. Second, SDFit retrieves an initial 3D shape that likely matches the image, by exploiting foundational models for efficient look-up into 3D shape databases. Third, SDFit initializes pose by establishing rich 2D-3D correspondences between the image and the mSDF through foundational features. We evaluate SDFit on three image datasets, i.e., Pix3D, Pascal3D+, and COMIC. SDFit performs on par with SotA feed-forward networks for unoccluded images and common poses, but is uniquely robust to occlusions and uncommon poses. Moreover, it requires no retraining for unseen images. Thus, SDFit contributes new insights for generalizing in the wild. Code is available at https://anticdimi.github.io/sdfit.

Abstract: Distance-based metrics, such as the Hausdorff distance (HD), are widely used to validate segmentation performance in (bio)medical imaging. However, their implementation is complex, and critical differences across open-source tools remain largely unrecognized by the community. These discrepancies undermine benchmarking efforts, introduce bias in biomarker calculations, and potentially distort medical device development and clinical commissioning. In this study, we systematically dissect 11 open-source tools that implement distance-based metric computation by performing both a conceptual analysis of their computational steps and an empirical analysis on representative two- and three-dimensional image datasets. Alarmingly, we observed deviations in HD exceeding 100 mm and identified multiple statistically significant differences between tools - demonstrating that statistically significant improvements on the same set of segmentations can be achieved simply by selecting a particular implementation. These findings cast doubts on the validity of prior comparisons of results across studies without accounting for the differences in metric implementations. To address this, we provide practical recommendations for tool selection; additionally, our conceptual analysis informs about the future evolution of implementing open-source tools.

Abstract: Mistake action detection is crucial for developing intelligent archives that detect workers' errors and provide feedback. Existing studies have focused on visually apparent mistakes in free-style activities, resulting in video-only approaches to mistake detection. However, in text-following activities, models cannot determine the correctness of some actions without referring to the texts. Additionally, current mistake datasets rarely use procedural texts for video recording except for cooking. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes the EgoOops dataset, where egocentric videos record erroneous activities when following procedural texts across diverse domains. It features three types of annotations: video-text alignment, mistake labels, and descriptions for mistakes. We also propose a mistake detection approach, combining video-text alignment and mistake label classification to leverage the texts. Our experimental results show that incorporating procedural texts is essential for mistake detection. Data is available through https://y-haneji.github.io/EgoOops-project-page/.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects or regions within 3D scenes guided by natural language descriptions. While indoor 3D VG has advanced, outdoor 3D VG remains underexplored due to two challenges: (1) large-scale outdoor LiDAR scenes are dominated by background points and contain limited foreground information, making cross-modal alignment and contextual understanding more difficult; and (2) most outdoor datasets lack spatial annotations for referential non-target objects, which hinders explicit learning of referential context. To this end, we propose LidaRefer, a context-aware 3D VG framework for outdoor scenes. LidaRefer incorporates an object-centric feature selection strategy to focus on semantically relevant visual features while reducing computational overhead. Then, its transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture excels at establishing fine-grained cross-modal alignment between refined visual features and word-level text features, and capturing comprehensive global context. Additionally, we present Discriminative-Supportive Collaborative localization (DiSCo), a novel supervision strategy that explicitly models spatial relationships between target, contextual, and ambiguous objects for accurate target identification. To enable this without manual labeling, we introduce a pseudo-labeling approach that retrieves 3D localization labels for referential non-target objects. LidaRefer achieves state-of-the-art performance on Talk2Car-3D dataset under various evaluation settings.

Abstract: In recent decades, chemistry publications and patents have increased rapidly. A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available in huggingface.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they continue to suffer from significant hallucination issues, including object, attribute, and relational hallucinations. To accurately detect these hallucinations, we investigated the variations in cross-modal attention patterns between hallucination and non-hallucination states. Leveraging these distinctions, we developed a lightweight detector capable of identifying hallucinations. Our proposed method, Detecting Hallucinations by Cross-modal Attention Patterns (DHCP), is straightforward and does not require additional LVLM training or extra LVLM inference steps. Experimental results show that DHCP achieves remarkable performance in hallucination detection. By offering novel insights into the identification and analysis of hallucinations in LVLMs, DHCP contributes to advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of these models. The code is available at https://github.com/btzyd/DHCP.

Abstract: In recent years, simultaneous learning of multiple dense prediction tasks with partially annotated label data has emerged as an important research area. Previous works primarily focus on leveraging cross-task relations or conducting adversarial training for extra regularization, which achieve promising performance improvements, while still suffering from the lack of direct pixel-wise supervision and extra training of heavy mapping networks. To effectively tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach to optimize a set of compact learnable hierarchical task tokens, including global and fine-grained ones, to discover consistent pixel-wise supervision signals in both feature and prediction levels. Specifically, the global task tokens are designed for effective cross-task feature interactions in a global context. Then, a group of fine-grained task-specific spatial tokens for each task is learned from the corresponding global task tokens. It is embedded to have dense interactions with each task-specific feature map. The learned global and local fine-grained task tokens are further used to discover pseudo task-specific dense labels at different levels of granularity, and they can be utilized to directly supervise the learning of the multi-task dense prediction framework. Extensive experimental results on challenging NYUD-v2, Cityscapes, and PASCAL Context datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for partially annotated multi-task dense prediction.

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results, their high computational costs pose a significant barrier to wide application. To enhance inference efficiency, most existing approaches can be categorized as parameter-dependent or token-dependent strategies to reduce computational demands. However, parameter-dependent methods require retraining LVLMs to recover performance while token-dependent strategies struggle to consistently select the most relevant tokens. In this paper, we systematically analyze the above challenges and provide a series of valuable insights for inference acceleration. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, the Pruning All-Rounder (PAR). Different from previous works, PAR develops a meta-router to adaptively organize pruning flows across both tokens and layers. With a self-supervised learning manner, our method achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Notably, PAR is highly flexible, offering multiple pruning versions to address a range of acceleration scenarios. The code for this work is publicly available at https://github.com/ASGO-MM/Pruning-All-Rounder.

To fill this gap, we introduce VQ-FocusAmbiguity, the first VQA dataset that visually grounds each plausible image region a question could refer to when arriving at valid answers. We next analyze and compare our dataset to existing datasets to reveal its unique properties. Finally, we benchmark modern models for two novel tasks related to acknowledging focus ambiguity: recognizing whether a visual question has focus ambiguity and locating all plausible focus regions within the image. Results show that the dataset is challenging for modern models. To facilitate future progress on these tasks, we publicly share the dataset with an evaluation server at https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/focus-ambiguity-in-visual-questions.

Abstract: Access to below-canopy volumetric vegetation data is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics. We address the long-standing limitation of remote sensing to penetrate deep into dense canopy layers. LiDAR and radar are currently considered the primary options for measuring 3D vegetation structures, while cameras can only extract the reflectance and depth of top layers. Using conventional, high-resolution aerial images, our approach allows sensing deep into self-occluding vegetation volumes, such as forests. It is similar in spirit to the imaging process of wide-field microscopy, but can handle much larger scales and strong occlusion. We scan focal stacks by synthetic-aperture imaging with drones and reduce out-of-focus signal contributions using pre-trained 3D convolutional neural networks with mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function. The resulting volumetric reflectance stacks contain low-frequency representations of the vegetation volume. Combining multiple reflectance stacks from various spectral channels provides insights into plant health, growth, and environmental conditions throughout the entire vegetation volume. Compared with simulated ground truth, our correction leads to ~x7 average improvements (min: ~x2, max: ~x12) for forest densities of 220 trees/ha - 1680 trees/ha. In our field experiment, we achieved an MSE of 0.05 when comparing with the top-vegetation layer that was measured with classical multispectral aerial imaging.

Abstract: Autonomous driving simulators provide an effective and low-cost alternative for evaluating or enhancing visual perception models. However, the reliability of evaluation depends on the diversity and realism of the generated scenes. Extreme weather conditions, particularly extreme rainfalls, are rare and costly to capture in real-world settings. While simulated environments can help address this limitation, existing rainy image synthesizers often suffer from poor controllability over illumination and limited realism, which significantly undermines the effectiveness of the model evaluation. To that end, we propose a learning-from-rendering rainy image synthesizer, which combines the benefits of the realism of rendering-based methods and the controllability of learning-based methods. To validate the effectiveness of our extreme rainy image synthesizer on semantic segmentation task, we require a continuous set of well-labeled extreme rainy images. By integrating the proposed synthesizer with the CARLA driving simulator, we develop CARLARain an extreme rainy street scene simulator which can obtain paired rainy-clean images and labels under complex illumination conditions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that CARLARain can effectively improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation models in extreme rainy scenes, with the models' accuracy (mIoU) improved by 5% - 8% on the synthetic dataset and significantly enhanced in real extreme rainy scenarios under complex illuminations. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/kb824999404/CARLARain/.

OCL's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from these aggregated slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. However, existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways and often fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a clean architecture--Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO)--that unifies mainstream OCL methods. The key to our unification is simple yet effective, just shared quantizing the same VFM representation as the reconstruction target. Through mathematical modeling and statistical verification, we further analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and how their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. The implementation and model checkpoints are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer the knowledge of a more capable yet cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model. In recent years, relation-based KD methods have fallen behind, as their instance-matching counterparts dominate in performance. In this paper, we revive relational KD by identifying and tackling several key issues in relation-based methods, including their susceptibility to overfitting and spurious responses. Specifically, we transfer novelly constructed affinity graphs that compactly encapsulate a wealth of beneficial inter-sample, inter-class, and inter-view correlations by exploiting virtual views and relations as a new kind of knowledge. As a result, the student has access to richer guidance signals and stronger regularisation throughout the distillation process. To further mitigate the adverse impact of spurious responses, we prune the affinity graphs by dynamically detaching redundant and unreliable edges. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed virtual relation matching (VRM) method, where it consistently sets new state-of-the-art records over a range of models, architectures, tasks, and set-ups. For instance, VRM for the first time hits 74.0% accuracy for ResNet50-to-MobileNetV2 distillation on ImageNet, and improves DeiT-T by 14.44% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet56 teacher.

Abstract: Real-time video segmentation is a promising opportunity for AI-assisted surgery, offering intraoperative guidance by identifying tools and anatomical structures. Despite growing interest in surgical video segmentation, annotation protocols vary widely across datasets -- some provide dense, frame-by-frame labels, while others rely on sparse annotations sampled at low frame rates such as 1 FPS. In this study, we investigate how such inconsistencies in annotation density and frame rate sampling influence the evaluation of zero-shot segmentation models, using SAM2 as a case study for cholecystectomy procedures. Surprisingly, we find that under conventional sparse evaluation settings, lower frame rates can appear to outperform higher ones due to a smoothing effect that conceals temporal inconsistencies. However, when assessed under real-time streaming conditions, higher frame rates yield superior segmentation stability, particularly for dynamic objects like surgical graspers. To understand how these differences align with human perception, we conducted a survey among surgeons, nurses, and machine learning engineers and found that participants consistently preferred high-FPS segmentation overlays, reinforcing the importance of evaluating every frame in real-time applications rather than relying on sparse sampling strategies. Our findings highlight the risk of evaluation bias that is introduced by inconsistent dataset protocols and bring attention to the need for temporally fair benchmarking in surgical video AI.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as promising alternative in 3D representation. However, it still suffers from high training cost. This paper introduces LiteGS, a high performance framework that systematically optimizes the 3DGS training pipeline from multiple aspects. At the low-level computation layer, we design a ``warp-based raster'' associated with two hardware-aware optimizations to significantly reduce gradient reduction overhead. At the mid-level data management layer, we introduce dynamic spatial sorting based on Morton coding to enable a performant ``Cluster-Cull-Compact'' pipeline and improve data locality, therefore reducing cache misses. At the top-level algorithm layer, we establish a new robust densification criterion based on the variance of the opacity gradient, paired with a more stable opacity control mechanism, to achieve more precise parameter growth. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGS accelerates the original 3DGS training by up to 13.4x with comparable or superior quality and surpasses the current SOTA in lightweight models by up to 1.4x speedup. For high-quality reconstruction tasks, LiteGS sets a new accuracy record and decreases the training time by an order of magnitude.

Abstract: Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) is a challenging task given that only bag-level labels are provided, while each bag typically contains multiple instances. This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets. Our WeakSupCon code is available at github.com/BzhangURU/Paper_WeakSupCon

Abstract: We completely classify all minimal problems for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) where arrangements of points and lines are fully observed by multiple uncalibrated pinhole cameras. We find 291 minimal problems, 73 of which have unique solutions and can thus be solved linearly. Two of the linear problems allow an arbitrary number of views, while all other minimal problems have at most 9 cameras. All minimal problems have at most 7 points and at most 12 lines. We compute the number of solutions of each minimal problem, as this gives a measurement of the problem's intrinsic difficulty, and find that these number are relatively low (e.g., when comparing with minimal problems for calibrated cameras). Finally, by exploring stabilizer subgroups of subarrangements, we develop a geometric and systematic way to 1) factorize minimal problems into smaller problems, 2) identify minimal problems in underconstrained problems, and 3) formally prove non-minimality.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in object inpainting by providing high-level semantic guidance through text prompts. However, they often lack precise pixel-level spatial control, especially in scenarios involving partially corrupted objects where critical uncorrupted cues remain. To overcome this limitation, sketch-guided methods have been introduced, using either indirect gradient modulation or direct sketch injection to improve structural control. Yet, existing approaches typically establish a one-way mapping from the sketch to the masked regions only, neglecting the contextual information from unmasked object areas. This leads to a disconnection between the sketch and the uncorrupted content, thereby causing sketch-guided inconsistency and structural mismatch. To tackle this challenge, we propose a sketch-guided bidirectional feature interaction framework built upon a pretrained Stable Diffusion model. Our bidirectional interaction features two complementary directions, context-to-sketch and sketch-to-inpainting, that enable fine-grained spatial control for partially corrupted object inpainting. In the context-to-sketch direction, multi-scale latents from uncorrupted object regions are propagated to the sketch branch to generate a visual mask that adapts the sketch features to the visible context and denoising progress. In the sketch-to-inpainting direction, a sketch-conditional affine transformation modulates the influence of sketch guidance based on the learned visual mask, ensuring consistency with uncorrupted object content. This interaction is applied at multiple scales within the encoder of the diffusion U-Net, enabling the model to restore object structures with enhanced spatial fidelity. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.

Abstract: We present a novel human-in-the-loop approach to estimate 3D scene layout that uses human feedback from an egocentric standpoint. We study this approach through introduction of a novel local correction task, where users identify local errors and prompt a model to automatically correct them. Building on SceneScript, a state-of-the-art framework for 3D scene layout estimation that leverages structured language, we propose a solution that structures this problem as "infilling", a task studied in natural language processing. We train a multi-task version of SceneScript that maintains performance on global predictions while significantly improving its local correction ability. We integrate this into a human-in-the-loop system, enabling a user to iteratively refine scene layout estimates via a low-friction "one-click fix'' workflow. Our system enables the final refined layout to diverge from the training distribution, allowing for more accurate modelling of complex layouts.

Abstract: Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop an intuitive number sense similar to humans? Targeting this problem, we introduce Visual Number Benchmark (VisNumBench) to evaluate the number sense abilities of MLLMs across a wide range of visual numerical tasks. VisNumBench consists of about 1,900 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from both synthetic and real-world visual data, covering seven visual numerical attributes and four types of visual numerical estimation tasks. Our experiments on VisNumBench led to the following key findings: (i) The 17 MLLMs we tested, including open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, as well as proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, perform significantly below human levels in number sense-related tasks. (ii) Multimodal mathematical models and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) models did not exhibit significant improvements in number sense abilities. (iii) Stronger MLLMs with larger parameter sizes and broader general abilities demonstrate modest gains in number sense abilities. We believe VisNumBench will serve as a valuable resource for the research community, encouraging further advancements in enhancing MLLMs' number sense abilities. Code and dataset are available at https://wwwtttjjj.github.io/VisNumBench/.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has highlighted the critical roles of both the visual backbone and the underlying language model. While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/LLaVA-MORE.

Abstract: Understanding scene contexts is crucial for machines to perform tasks and adapt prior knowledge in unseen or noisy 3D environments. As data-driven learning is intractable to comprehensively encapsulate diverse ranges of layouts and open spaces, we propose teaching machines to identify relational commonalities in 3D spaces. Instead of focusing on point-wise or object-wise representations, we introduce 3D scene analogies, which are smooth maps between 3D scene regions that align spatial relationships. Unlike well-studied single instance-level maps, these scene-level maps smoothly link large scene regions, potentially enabling unique applications in trajectory transfer in AR/VR, long demonstration transfer for imitation learning, and context-aware object rearrangement. To find 3D scene analogies, we propose neural contextual scene maps, which extract descriptor fields summarizing semantic and geometric contexts, and holistically align them in a coarse-to-fine manner for map estimation. This approach reduces reliance on individual feature points, making it robust to input noise or shape variations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying scene analogies and transferring trajectories or object placements in diverse indoor scenes, indicating its potential for robotics and AR/VR applications.

Abstract: Contrastive learning methods in self-supervised settings have primarily focused on pre-training encoders, while decoders are typically introduced and trained separately for downstream dense prediction tasks. However, this conventional approach overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon, an efficient encoder-decoder self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that supports joint contrastive pre-training. We first extend existing SSL architectures to accommodate diverse decoders and their corresponding contrastive losses. Then, we introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives to enable the joint pre-training of encoder-decoder architectures. By adapting an established contrastive SSL framework for dense prediction tasks, DeCon achieves new state-of-the-art results: on COCO object detection and instance segmentation when pre-trained on COCO dataset; across almost all dense downstream benchmark tasks when pre-trained on COCO+ and ImageNet-1K. Our results demonstrate that joint pre-training enhances the representation power of the encoder and improves performance in dense prediction tasks. This gain persists across heterogeneous decoder architectures, various encoder architectures, and in out-of-domain limited-data scenarios.

Abstract: Two-hand reconstruction from monocular images faces persistent challenges due to complex and dynamic hand postures and occlusions, causing significant difficulty in achieving plausible interaction alignment. Existing approaches struggle with such alignment issues, often resulting in misalignment and penetration artifacts. To tackle this, we propose a dual-stage Foundation-to-Diffusion framework that precisely align 2D prior guidance from vision foundation models and diffusion-based generative 3D interaction refinement to achieve occlusion-robust two-hand reconstruction. First, we introduce a lightweight fusion alignment encoder that aligns fused multimodal 2D priors like key points, segmentation maps, and depth cues from vision foundation models during training. This provides robust structured guidance, further enabling efficient inference without heavy foundation model encoders at test time while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy. Second, we implement a two-hand diffusion model explicitly trained to convert interpenetrated 3D poses into plausible, penetration-free counterparts. Through collision gradient-guided denoising, the model rectifies artifacts while preserving natural spatial relationships between hands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on InterHand2.6M, HIC, and FreiHAND datasets, significantly advancing occlusion handling and interaction robustness. Our code will be publicly released.

Abstract: The development of aerial holistic scene understanding algorithms is hindered by the scarcity of comprehensive datasets that enable both semantic and geometric reconstruction. While synthetic datasets offer an alternative, existing options exhibit task-specific limitations, unrealistic scene compositions, and rendering artifacts that compromise real-world applicability. We introduce ClaraVid, a synthetic aerial dataset specifically designed to overcome these limitations. Comprising 16,917 high-resolution images captured at 4032x3024 from multiple viewpoints across diverse landscapes, ClaraVid provides dense depth maps, panoptic segmentation, sparse point clouds, and dynamic object masks, while mitigating common rendering artifacts. To further advance neural reconstruction, we introduce the Delentropic Scene Profile (DSP), a novel complexity metric derived from differential entropy analysis, designed to quantitatively assess scene difficulty and inform reconstruction tasks. Utilizing DSP, we systematically benchmark neural reconstruction methods, uncovering a consistent, measurable correlation between scene complexity and reconstruction accuracy. Empirical results indicate that higher delentropy strongly correlates with increased reconstruction errors, validating DSP as a reliable complexity prior.

Abstract: The synergy between generative and discriminative models receives growing attention. While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into multimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance. All the models and codes are made publicly available.

Abstract: Unified image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multi-source images, enhancing image quality through a unified framework applicable to diverse fusion tasks. While treating all fusion tasks as a unified problem facilitates task-invariant knowledge sharing, it often overlooks task-specific characteristics, thereby limiting the overall performance. Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task identification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks. However, this dependence during inference restricts the model's generalization to unseen fusion tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified image fusion framework named "TITA", which dynamically balances both Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation. For task-invariant interaction, we introduce the Interaction-enhanced Pixel Attention (IPA) module to enhance pixel-wise interactions for better multi-source complementary information extraction. For task-specific adaptation, the Operation-based Adaptive Fusion (OAF) module dynamically adjusts operation weights based on task properties. Additionally, we incorporate the Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization (FAMO) strategy to mitigate the impact of gradient conflicts across tasks during joint training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TITA not only achieves competitive performance compared to specialized methods across three image fusion scenarios but also exhibits strong generalization to unseen fusion tasks. The source codes are released at https://github.com/huxingyuabc/TITA.

Abstract: As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach. The code and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/continental/EP-Diffuser.

Abstract: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have become one of the fundamental architectural component in point cloud analysis due to its effective feature learning mechanism. However, when processing complex geometric structures in point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter counts and computational complexity (FLOPs). This work highlights the potential of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new avenues for research in point cloud understanding.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.

Abstract: Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of tasks, yet concerns about their potential biases exist. This work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a country level. Utilizing the geographically diverse Country211 dataset, we probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting strategies: open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) including challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly across diverse global contexts.

Abstract: Fire detection in dynamic environments faces continuous challenges, including the interference of illumination changes, many false detections or missed detections, and it is difficult to achieve both efficiency and accuracy. To address the problem of feature extraction limitation and information loss in the existing YOLO-based models, this study propose You Only Look Once for Fire Detection with Attention-guided Inverted Residual and Dual-pooling Downscale Fusion (YOLO-FireAD) with two core innovations: (1) Attention-guided Inverted Residual Block (AIR) integrates hybrid channel-spatial attention with inverted residuals to adaptively enhance fire features and suppress environmental noise; (2) Dual Pool Downscale Fusion Block (DPDF) preserves multi-scale fire patterns through learnable fusion of max-average pooling outputs, mitigating small-fire detection failures. Extensive evaluation on two public datasets shows the efficient performance of our model. Our proposed model keeps the sum amount of parameters (1.45M, 51.8% lower than YOLOv8n) (4.6G, 43.2% lower than YOLOv8n), and mAP75 is higher than the mainstream real-time object detection models YOLOv8n, YOL-Ov9t, YOLOv10n, YOLO11n, YOLOv12n and other YOLOv8 variants 1.3-5.5%.

Abstract: With the development of Embodied Artificial intelligence, the end-to-end control policy such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model has become the mainstream. Existing VLA models faces expensive computing/storage cost, which need to be optimized. Quantization is considered as the most effective method which can not only reduce the memory cost but also achieve computation acceleration. However, we find the token alignment of VLA models hinders the application of existing quantization methods. To address this, we proposed an optimized framework called EaqVLA, which apply encoding-aligned quantization to VLA models. Specifically, we propose an complete analysis method to find the misalignment in various granularity. Based on the analysis results, we propose a mixed precision quantization with the awareness of encoding alignment. Experiments shows that the porposed EaqVLA achieves better quantization performance (with the minimal quantization loss for end-to-end action control and xxx times acceleration) than existing quantization methods.

Abstract: Despite advances in general video understanding, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) face challenges in precise temporal localization due to discrete time representations and limited temporally aware datasets. Existing methods for temporal expression either conflate time with text-based numerical values, add a series of dedicated temporal tokens, or regress time using specialized temporal grounding heads. To address these issues, we introduce DisTime, a lightweight framework designed to enhance temporal comprehension in Video-LLMs. DisTime employs a learnable token to create a continuous temporal embedding space and incorporates a Distribution-based Time Decoder that generates temporal probability distributions, effectively mitigating boundary ambiguities and maintaining temporal continuity. Additionally, the Distribution-based Time Encoder re-encodes timestamps to provide time markers for Video-LLMs. To overcome temporal granularity limitations in existing datasets, we propose an automated annotation paradigm that combines the captioning capabilities of Video-LLMs with the localization expertise of dedicated temporal models. This leads to the creation of InternVid-TG, a substantial dataset with 1.25M temporally grounded events across 179k videos, surpassing ActivityNet-Caption by 55 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTime achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in three time-sensitive tasks while maintaining competitive performance in Video QA tasks. Code and data are released at https://github.com/josephzpng/DisTime.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for continual learning in anomaly detection, aimed at better reflecting real-world deployment scenarios. Our benchmark, Continual-MEGA, includes a large and diverse dataset that significantly expands existing evaluation settings by combining carefully curated existing datasets with our newly proposed dataset, ContinualAD. In addition to standard continual learning with expanded quantity, we propose a novel scenario that measures zero-shot generalization to unseen classes, those not observed during continual adaptation. This setting poses a new problem setting that continual adaptation also enhances zero-shot performance. We also present a unified baseline algorithm that improves robustness in few-shot detection and maintains strong generalization. Through extensive evaluations, we report three key findings: (1) existing methods show substantial room for improvement, particularly in pixel-level defect localization; (2) our proposed method consistently outperforms prior approaches; and (3) the newly introduced ContinualAD dataset enhances the performance of strong anomaly detection models. We release the benchmark and code in https://github.com/Continual-Mega/Continual-Mega.

Abstract: Electronic component classification and detection are crucial in manufacturing industries, significantly reducing labor costs and promoting technological and industrial development. Pre-trained models, especially those trained on ImageNet, are highly effective in image classification, allowing researchers to achieve excellent results even with limited data. This paper compares the performance of twelve ImageNet pre-trained models in classifying electronic components. Our findings show that all models tested delivered respectable accuracies. MobileNet-V2 recorded the highest at 99.95%, while EfficientNet-B0 had the lowest at 92.26%. These results underscore the substantial benefits of using ImageNet pre-trained models in image classification tasks and confirm the practical applicability of these methods in the electronics manufacturing sector.

<title>ZIP: Scalable Crowd Counting via Zero-Inflated Poisson Modeling</title>

Abstract: Most crowd counting methods directly regress blockwise density maps using Mean Squared Error (MSE) losses. This practice has two key limitations: (1) it fails to account for the extreme spatial sparsity of annotations - over 95% of 8x8 blocks are empty across standard benchmarks, so supervision signals in informative regions are diluted by the predominant zeros; (2) MSE corresponds to a Gaussian error model that poorly matches discrete, non-negative count data. To address these issues, we introduce ZIP, a scalable crowd counting framework that models blockwise counts with a Zero-Inflated Poisson likelihood: a zero-inflation term learns the probability a block is structurally empty (handling excess zeros), while the Poisson component captures expected counts when people are present (respecting discreteness). We provide a generalization analysis showing a tighter risk bound for ZIP than MSE-based losses and DMCount provided that the training resolution is moderately large. To assess the scalability of ZIP, we instantiate it on backbones spanning over 100x in parameters/compute. Experiments on ShanghaiTech A & B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU-Crowd demonstrate that ZIP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all model scales.

<title>Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges. Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise in quality.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential practical applications in the environment.

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision, particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations: Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI, and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter, facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving community.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a state-of-the-art generative modeling framework that transform noise to images via Langevin sampling, guided by the score, which is the gradient of the logarithm of the data distribution. Recent works have shown empirically that the generation quality can be improved when guided by classifier network, which is typically the discriminator trained in a generative adversarial network (GAN) setting. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of the GAN discriminator on Langevin-based sampling, and show that the IPM-GAN optimization can be seen as one of smoothed score-matching, wherein the scores of the data and the generator distributions are convolved with the kernel function associated with the IPM. The proposed approach serves to unify score-based training and optimization of IPM-GANs. Based on these insights, we demonstrate that closed-form kernel-based discriminator guidance, results in improvements (in terms of CLIP-FID and KID metrics) when applied atop baseline diffusion models. We demonstrate these results on the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and latent diffusion model (LDM) settings on various standard datasets. We also show that the proposed approach can be combined with existing accelerated-diffusion techniques to improve latent-space image generation.

Abstract: The past few years have witnessed substantial advances in image generation powered by diffusion models. However, it was shown that diffusion models are susceptible to training data memorization, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and privacy invasion. This study delves into a rigorous analysis of memorization in diffusion models. We introduce InvMM, an inversion-based measure of memorization, which is based on inverting a sensitive latent noise distribution accounting for the replication of an image. For accurate estimation of the measure, we propose an adaptive algorithm that balances the normality and sensitivity of the noise distribution. Comprehensive experiments across four datasets, conducted on both unconditional and text-guided diffusion models, demonstrate that InvMM provides a reliable and complete quantification of memorization. Notably, InvMM is commensurable between samples, reveals the true extent of memorization from an adversarial standpoint and implies how memorization differs from membership. In practice, it serves as an auditing tool for developers to reliably assess the risk of memorization, thereby contributing to the enhancement of trustworthiness and privacy-preserving capabilities of diffusion models.

Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis can predict the risk of malignant disease transformation, thereby increasing the probability of effective treatment. Identifying mild syndrome with small pathological regions serves as an ominous warning and is fundamental in the early diagnosis of diseases. While deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in segmenting medical objects, analyzing small areas in medical images remains challenging. This difficulty arises due to information losses and compression defects from convolution and pooling operations in CNNs, which become more pronounced as the network deepens, especially for small medical objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-variant attention-based network (SvANet) for accurately segmenting small-scale objects in medical images. The SvANet consists of scale-variant attention, cross-scale guidance, Monte Carlo attention, and vision transformer, which incorporates cross-scale features and alleviates compression artifacts for enhancing the discrimination of small medical objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SvANet, achieving 96.12%, 96.11%, 89.79%, 84.15%, 80.25%, 73.05%, and 72.58% in mean Dice coefficient for segmenting kidney tumors, skin lesions, hepatic tumors, polyps, surgical excision cells, retinal vasculatures, and sperms, which occupy less than 1% of the image areas in KiTS23, ISIC 2018, ATLAS, PolypGen, TissueNet, FIVES, and SpermHealth datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics. Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware, but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modeled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities, and may change their material properties with use. Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot's actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots' materials, actuation, or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication, and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.

Abstract: Depth perception is essential for a robot's spatial and geometric understanding of its environment, with many tasks traditionally relying on hardware-based depth sensors like RGB-D or stereo cameras. However, these sensors face practical limitations, including issues with transparent and reflective objects, high costs, calibration complexity, spatial and energy constraints, and increased failure rates in compound systems. While monocular depth estimation methods offer a cost-effective and simpler alternative, their adoption in robotics is limited due to their output of relative rather than metric depth, which is crucial for robotics applications. In this paper, we propose a method that utilizes a single calibrated camera, enabling the robot to act as a "measuring stick" to convert relative depth estimates into metric depth in real-time as tasks are performed. Our approach employs an LSTM-based metric depth regressor, trained online and refined through probabilistic filtering, to accurately restore the metric depth across the monocular depth map, particularly in areas proximal to the robot's motion. Experiments with real robots demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art monocular metric depth estimation techniques, achieving a 22.1% reduction in depth error and a 52% increase in success rate for a downstream task.

Abstract: Enabling digital humans to express rich emotions has significant applications in dialogue systems, gaming, and other interactive scenarios. While recent advances in talking head synthesis have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization, they tend to overlook the rich and dynamic nature of facial expressions. To fill this critical gap, we introduce an end-to-end text-to-expression model that explicitly focuses on emotional dynamics. Our model learns expressive facial variations in a continuous latent space and generates expressions that are diverse, fluid, and emotionally coherent. To support this task, we introduce EmoAva, a large-scale and high-quality dataset containing 15,000 text-3D expression pairs. Extensive experiments on both existing datasets and EmoAva demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumor, poses a severe clinical challenge due to its diffuse microscopic infiltration, which remains largely undetected on standard MRI. As a result, current radiotherapy planning employs a uniform 15 mm margin around the resection cavity, failing to capture patient-specific tumor spread. Tumor growth modeling offers a promising approach to reveal this hidden infiltration. However, methods based on partial differential equations or physics-informed neural networks tend to be computationally intensive or overly constrained, limiting their clinical adaptability to individual patients. In this work, we propose a lightweight, rapid, and robust optimization framework that estimates the 3D tumor concentration by fitting it to MRI tumor segmentations while enforcing a smooth concentration landscape. This approach achieves superior tumor recurrence prediction on 192 brain tumor patients across two public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while reducing runtime from 30 minutes to less than one minute. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's versatility and adaptability by showing its ability to seamlessly integrate additional imaging modalities or physical constraints.

Abstract: Vision-based control relies on accurate perception to achieve robustness. However, image distribution changes caused by sensor noise, adverse weather, and dynamic lighting can degrade perception, leading to suboptimal control decisions. Existing approaches, including domain adaptation and adversarial training, improve robustness but struggle to generalize to unseen corruptions while introducing computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a real-time image repair module that restores corrupted images before they are used by the controller. Our method leverages generative adversarial models, specifically CycleGAN and pix2pix, for image repair. CycleGAN enables unpaired image-to-image translation to adapt to novel corruptions, while pix2pix exploits paired image data when available to improve the quality. To ensure alignment with control performance, we introduce a control-focused loss function that prioritizes perceptual consistency in repaired images. We evaluated our method in a simulated autonomous racing environment with various visual corruptions. The results show that our approach significantly improves performance compared to baselines, mitigating distribution shift and enhancing controller reliability.

<title>Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989</link>

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.

Abstract: Prediction tasks in digital pathology are challenging due to the massive size of whole-slide images (WSIs) and the weak nature of training signals. Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.

Abstract: Tracking motions of humans or objects in the surroundings of the robot is essential to improve safe robot motions and reactions. In this work, we present an approach for scene flow estimation from low-density and noisy point clouds acquired from miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors distributed on the robot body. The proposed method clusters points from consecutive frames and applies Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to estimate a dense motion flow, with additional steps introduced to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and low-density data points. Specifically, we employ a fitness-based classification to distinguish between stationary and moving points and an inlier removal strategy to refine geometric correspondences. The proposed approach is validated in an experimental setup where 24 ToF are used to estimate the velocity of an object moving at different controlled speeds. Experimental results show that the method consistently approximates the direction of the motion and its magnitude with an error which is in line with sensor noise.

Abstract: Wave-like images-from attosecond streaking spectrograms to optical spectra, audio mel-spectrograms and periodic video frames-encode critical harmonic structures that elude conventional feature extractors. We propose a unified, matrix-equivalent framework that reinterprets convolution and attention as linear transforms on flattened inputs, revealing filter weights as basis vectors spanning latent feature subspaces. To infuse spectral priors we apply elementwise $\sin(\cdot)$ mappings to each weight matrix. Embedding these transforms into CNN, ViT and Capsule architectures yields Sin-Basis Networks with heightened sensitivity to periodic motifs and built-in invariance to spatial shifts. Experiments on a diverse collection of wave-like image datasets-including 80,000 synthetic attosecond streaking spectrograms, thousands of Raman, photoluminescence and FTIR spectra, mel-spectrograms from AudioSet and cycle-pattern frames from Kinetics-demonstrate substantial gains in reconstruction accuracy, translational robustness and zero-shot cross-domain transfer. Theoretical analysis via matrix isomorphism and Mercer-kernel truncation quantifies how sinusoidal reparametrization enriches expressivity while preserving stability in data-scarce regimes. Sin-Basis Networks thus offer a lightweight, physics-informed approach to deep learning across all wave-form imaging modalities.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge (stability). Although pre-trained models (PTMs) have provided a strong foundation for CL, existing approaches face a fundamental challenge in balancing these two competing objectives. Current methods typically address stability by freezing the PTM backbone, which severely limits the model's plasticity, particularly when incoming data distribution diverges largely from the pre-training data. Alternatively, sequentially fine-tuning the entire PTM can adapt to new knowledge but often leads to catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the critical stability-plasticity trade-off in PTM-based CL. To address this limitation, we propose Adapting PTMs before the core CL} process (ACL), a novel framework that introduces a plug-and-play adaptation phase prior to learning each new task. During this phase, ACL refines the PTM backbone by aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them from irrelevant classes. This mechanism theoretically and empirically demonstrates desirable balance between stability and plasticity, significantly improving CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods. Code is available at https://github.com/byyx666/ACL_code.

Abstract: In breast cancer HER2 assessment, clinical evaluation relies on combined H&amp;E and IHC images, yet acquiring both modalities is often hindered by clinical constraints and cost. We propose an adaptive bimodal prediction framework that flexibly supports single- or dual-modality inputs through two core innovations: a dynamic branch selector activating modality completion or joint inference based on input availability, and a cross-modal GAN (CM-GAN) enabling feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities. This design dramatically improves H&amp;E-only accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25%, achieves 95.09% with full dual-modality inputs, and maintains 90.28% reliability under single-modality conditions. The "dual-modality preferred, single-modality compatible" architecture delivers near-dual-modality accuracy without mandatory synchronized acquisition, offering a cost-effective solution for resource-limited regions and significantly improving HER2 assessment accessibility.

<div> Keywords: 3D human reconstruction, texture alignment, part segmentation, texturing module, image generation network<br />
Summary:<br />PARTE is a novel framework for 3D human reconstruction that addresses the challenge of misaligned textures across different human parts. It leverages 3D part segmentation information to guide the reconstruction process. The framework consists of a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that predicts human part labels based on a textureless surface, and a part-guided texturing module (PartTexturer) that utilizes pre-trained image generation networks for texture alignment. By incorporating part information into texture reconstruction, PARTE achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments, highlighting its ability to maintain distinct textures for each human part without blending into others. PARTE's project page provides additional information on the framework and its capabilities.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions. In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module (PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction. The project page is available at https://hygenie1228.github.io/PARTE/.

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions. This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices. Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations; (2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning, prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches.

Summary:
TRIG-Bench introduces a dataset for exploring trade-offs in image generation models, encompassing 10 dimensions and 40,200 samples. The dataset allows for a detailed evaluation of model performance across various aspects such as realism, aesthetics, ambiguity, and bias. TRIGScore, a metric based on VLM, adapts to different dimensions while evaluating 14 models in text-to-image and image-to-image tasks. The Relation Recognition System generates Dimension Trade-off Maps to visually represent trade-offs among model capabilities. Through experiments, it is shown that the maps provide a deeper understanding of model-specific weaknesses and strengths. Fine-tuning models based on the maps can help improve overall performance by addressing dimension-specific weaknesses. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple aspects when evaluating text-to-image and image-to-image generation models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics, Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains 40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to enhance overall performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/fesvhtr/TRIG

Summary:
The ColorSense Learner framework mimics human color perception for few-shot learning, leveraging inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By highlighting color information across different channels, irrelevant features are filtered while discriminative characteristics are captured. This approach enhances intra-class commonality extraction and inter-class differences. The ColorSense Distiller, a meta-distiller using knowledge distillation, enhances the network's meta-learning ability using prior knowledge. Coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on eleven few-shot benchmarks validate the framework's strong generalization, robustness, and transferability, particularly in handling few-shot classification from a color perception perspective. <div>

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms. We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels, our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the perspective of color perception.

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children, encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG, medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT), T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2 alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

<div> keywords: terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation, supervised semantic segmentation, unsupervised segmentation, mobile robot video streams, temporal consistency

Summary: 
Frontier-Seg, a novel method, addresses the challenge of unsupervised terrain segmentation in autonomous ground navigation. It utilizes superpixel-level features extracted from DINOv2 backbones to identify persistent terrain boundaries in mobile robot video streams. By enforcing temporal consistency across frames, Frontier-Seg achieves robust perception in unstructured environments without human supervision. This approach overcomes the limitations of costly data collection and labor-intensive labeling associated with supervised methods. Moreover, it performs unsupervised segmentation across diverse off-road environments, including the RUGD and RELLIS-3D datasets. Frontier-Seg shows promise for applications in unrehearsed and ambiguous terrain scenarios where labeled data is scarce or domain-specific. Its ability to provide temporally consistent segmentation makes it a valuable asset for autonomous systems navigating challenging terrain environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

<div> Keywords: CLIP, multimodal learning, information misalignment, disentangled representation, SmartCLIP

Summary: 
SmartCLIP addresses the information misalignment and entangled representation issues faced by CLIP in multimodal learning. The model can align textual and visual representations flexibly across different granularities, preserving cross-modal semantic information while disentangling visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. By identifying and aligning the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner, SmartCLIP outperforms CLIP in various tasks and demonstrates superior capability in handling information misalignment. The proposed framework establishes theoretical conditions for flexible alignment between textual and visual representations, enabling the model to learn atomic concepts and generalize better on downstream tasks involving short prompts. The code for SmartCLIP is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning} has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only \emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also \emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

Summary:
The article proposes a clinical decision support framework called HOG-CNN for the automated analysis of fundus images to detect retinal diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Age-related Macular Degeneration. The framework integrates handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep convolutional neural network (CNN) representations to capture local texture patterns and high-level semantic features.

The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it suitable for deployment in clinical settings with limited resources. The comprehensive studies demonstrate the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features, positioning HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease screening.

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows, however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC, outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA, our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features. The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease screening.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a learnable variational model for image reconstruction that combines information from image and measurement domains. It presents a learned alternating minimization algorithm (LAMA) that incorporates a residual learning architecture and demonstrates convergence results. The LAMA-Net, a neural network architecture derived from LAMA, is highly interpretable and showcases outstanding stability and robustness. The integration of an initial-generating network improves performance, resulting in iLAMA-Net. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography validate the effectiveness of LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net compared to state-of-the-art methods. <div>
arXiv:2507.22316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work. We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

<div> ViT, CNN, Collaborative Domain Adaptation, late-life depression, structural brain MRI <br />
Summary: <br />
Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain MRI is crucial. Existing approaches for LLD detection face challenges due to limited sample sizes. The Collaborative Domain Adaptation (CDA) framework proposed in this study leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for global anatomical context and local structural feature extraction, respectively. The framework includes supervised training on labeled source data, self-supervised target feature adaptation, and collaborative training on unlabeled target data. By utilizing pseudo-labeled and augmented target-domain MRIs, the CDA enhances domain robustness and generalization. Experimental results on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods. <div>
arXiv:2507.22321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b) self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer. The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework to handle unfavorable input views. Traditional rendering setups for training feed-forward models are limited to favorable views, hindering real-world application. To address this limitation, a novel adaptation framework is proposed, utilizing pretrained models with low-rank adaptation layers and Gaussian adapter modules. Prior information from favorable images is leveraged to enhance geometric consistency and render accurate target views. A training strategy using an off-the-shelf dataset of favorable images is introduced. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets validate the method's effectiveness in handling unfavorable views. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in satellite imagery is crucial. Traditional methods are limited in supporting interactive, query-driven analysis. This work introduces RSICA, combining change detection and visual question answering for multi-turn exploration.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and (3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces the novel task of generalized face discovery (GFD), which combines traditional face identification with generalized category discovery. GFD requires recognizing known identities while also discovering new, unseen identities. The proposed method, FaceGCD, utilizes dynamically constructed instance-specific feature extractors generated by a HyperNetwork to capture subtle identity-specific cues. This approach outperforms existing methods and a strong baseline, ArcFace, in the GFD task, advancing open-world face recognition. <div>
arXiv:2507.22353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face recognition.

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data. We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features, ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC). Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF. Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30 percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without significantly increasing computational cost.

The framework leverages a multimodal swin-transformer and S3Attention architecture to make joint predictions based on input scene, group members, and context information. The authors extend the existing VGAF dataset to provide more detailed analysis beyond group-level emotions. GEMS predicts discrete and continuous emotions, including valence and arousal, at various levels of granularity. The benchmarking results show that GEMS outperforms state-of-the-art models on the VGAF-GEMS dataset. The code and data for GEMS are available on GitHub, opening up opportunities for further research in this area. <div>

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end, we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further research. The code and data is available at: https://github.com/katariaak579/GEMS

<div> frequency-based cues, vulnerability, VLMs, image transformations, authenticity detection<br />
Summary:<br />
This study explores the vulnerability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to subtle frequency-based perturbations in image content. The researchers demonstrate that these perturbations can disrupt the accuracy of VLM outputs in tasks such as DeepFake detection and image captioning. By manipulating images in the frequency domain, they show that VLMs can be misled into providing incorrect judgments, highlighting the potential fragility of these models. The findings suggest that VLMs may not always align with the true semantic content of images, especially when faced with visually-imperceptible frequency transformations. These results call into question the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications and emphasize the importance of developing more robust multimodal perception systems. Overall, the study highlights the need for further research to enhance the resilience of VLMs to frequency-based attacks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection. In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs, underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised learning, masked autoencoders, implicit neural representations, image reconstruction, out-of-distribution data<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework as an improved self-supervised learning method. MINR combines implicit neural representations with masked image modeling to enhance feature representation learning. Unlike masked autoencoders (MAE), MINR does not heavily rely on specific masking strategies during training and provides more robust and generalizable reconstructions, even for out-of-distribution data. MINR outperforms MAE in both in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios while maintaining model simplicity. The framework's versatility extends to various self-supervised learning applications, confirming its efficacy as a robust and efficient alternative for feature representation learning. <div>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations, we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to existing frameworks.

<div> Keywords: Moir\'e patterns, deep learning, image restoration, convolutional neural networks, artifact suppression

Summary:
Moir\'e patterns, caused by aliasing between structures and camera sensors, are a challenge in real-world applications. Existing CNN-based solutions struggle with diverse moir\'e patterns due to limited receptive fields. A new U-shaped network, MZNet, is proposed to remove moir\'é patterns effectively. It integrates Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block (MSDAB) for multi-scale feature extraction, Multi-Shape Large Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for diverse pattern capture, and Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for information flow. MZNet excels on high-resolution datasets, competes well on lower resolution, and maintains low computational cost. This efficient solution for real-world applications achieves state-of-the-art performance on moir\'é pattern removal. <div>
arXiv:2507.22407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns, primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns. It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block (MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together, these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

Summary:
UAVScenes is a new large-scale dataset created to enhance multi-modal perception for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It addresses the lack of frame-wise annotations for both images and LiDAR point clouds in existing datasets, enabling various tasks such as segmentation, depth estimation, localization, place recognition, and novel view synthesis. The dataset is built upon the MARS-LVIG dataset, providing accurate 6-DoF poses and manually labeled semantic annotations.

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs' surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses. These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and novel view synthesis (NVS).

<div> Keywords: aleatoric uncertainty, medical image segmentation, generative model, conditional flow matching, segmentation accuracy

Summary:
This paper introduces a method for quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation by leveraging conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based generative model. The current diffusion-based approaches have limitations in accurately capturing uncertainty due to their stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities. In contrast, the proposed method guides the flow model on the input image and samples multiple data points to synthesize segmentation samples reflecting the underlying data distribution. This approach produces segmentation results with highly accurate pixel-wise variance, particularly in regions with ambiguous boundaries. Experimental results show that the method achieves competitive segmentation accuracy and generates uncertainty maps that offer insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this work is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries, offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes.

Summary: 
LVLMs have become crucial in vision-language tasks, with CLIP as a key component. A new data refinement pipeline leverages LVLMs to enhance image-text pair data quality, creating VLM-150M dataset with multiple annotations. By incorporating negative descriptions and short tags, HQ-CLIP model improves upon traditional contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and visual understanding tasks. Surpassing models trained on larger datasets, HQ-CLIP showcases the effectiveness of this approach in improving performance with limited data resources. The code, data, and models are accessible for further exploration and research at https://zxwei.site/hqclip. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question: Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data than ours.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a novel domain adaptation approach for human pose estimation in the presence of motion blur. Traditional pose estimation models struggle in blurred environments due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. By leveraging event cameras, which are robust to motion blur, and utilizing event-based augmentation, the researchers generate motion-aware blurred images to bridge this domain gap without requiring paired annotations. They also develop a student-teacher framework that refines pseudo-labels iteratively using mutual uncertainty masking to enhance learning. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur in real-world scenarios. The findings showcase the potential of event cameras as an effective solution for domain adaptation in motion blur environments. <div>

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation, sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation, we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations. Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain adaptation in real-world motion blur environments.

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers. Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology (PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing its scalability for real-world applications.

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach, EDTR, for task-driven image restoration (TDIR), which aims to improve high-level vision tasks performance using low-quality inputs. Previous TDIR methods struggled with restoring images degraded by complex factors, motivating the use of the diffusion prior. EDTR effectively utilizes the diffusion prior by incorporating useful clues from mildly noisy pre-restored LQ images. By applying a small number of denoising steps, redundant details are prevented, enhancing task-related information. The method significantly boosts task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with various complex degradations. The combination of pixel-error-based pre-restored images and the diffusion prior proves to be successful in restoring task-relevant details, making EDTR a promising approach for TDIR. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs. Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.

Summary: <br />

- HMHI-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in UVOS and video saliency detection benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority and robustness across different backbones. <div>

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations. While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently, memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM), we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness. Project page: https://github.com/ZhengxyFlow/HMHI-Net .

The paper focuses on the detection of deepfakes, a significant threat in digital media, using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Existing methods rely on specialized classifiers for image manipulation detection, lacking robustness. The proposed VLM-based approach leverages zero-shot capabilities to enhance image classification for deepfake detection.

The results highlight the effectiveness of VLMs in detecting deepfakes and underline their superiority over traditional methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media, identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

The article presents a novel Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR) for pixel-level crack segmentation with low computational cost using multimodal data. The network includes two key modules - Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Visual State Space and Lightweight Dual Domain Dynamic Collaborative Fusion. The former adaptively models crack cues through an efficient scanning strategy, while the latter leverages adaptive frequency domain perceptron and dual-pooling fusion for effective integration of spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities.

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465 in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Karl1109/LIDAR-Mamba.

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization in zero-shot settings.

<div> Keywords: adverse weather, image restoration, spectral decomposition, group-wise attention, spatial grouping transformer

Summary:
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer) is introduced to address the challenges faced by All-in-One models in capturing diverse degradation patterns caused by adverse weather conditions. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features and low-frequency information, leveraging spectral decomposition and group-wise attention. By utilizing multi-head linear attention, the model effectively models the relationship between these features and generates a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on spatial similarity and image texture. The introduction of group-wise attention mechanism ensures robust adverse weather removal and consistent performance across various weather conditions. The Spatial Grouping Transformer Block integrates channel attention and spatial attention to balance feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies, resulting in superior performance in handling varied and intricate adverse weather degradations. <div>

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns, driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Summary:
- The paper introduces a degradation-aware conditional diffusion model for enhancing underwater images, addressing issues like colour distortions and low visibility.
- A dual-stream convolutional network predicts the degradation level of input images, providing guidance for a conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet backbone.
- Adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature refinement are enabled through the proposed method.
- Incorporation of underwater-specific physical priors is achieved with a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss function.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate superior restoration results in terms of colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details compared to state-of-the-art approaches. <div>
arXiv:2507.22501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and 46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities. Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile, simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our code is available at: https://github.com/wangzy01/ACTIVE-Action-from-Robotic-View.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new dataset containing annotated hepatic vasculature in surgical videos and proposes a high-resolution video vasculature segmentation network, HRVVS. By incorporating a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling model into the encoder and using a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network, HRVVS aims to improve information retention and minimize redundancy in the segmentation process. Experimental results on surgical video datasets demonstrate that HRVVS outperforms existing methods. The source code and dataset will be made publicly available, advancing research in the segmentation of hepatic vasculature in surgical videos. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures. However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain. To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and 11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The source code and dataset will be publicly available at \href{https://github.com/scott-yjyang/xx}{https://github.com/scott-yjyang/HRVVS}.

<div> Keywords: prompt-based continual learning, task-specific knowledge, prompt-evolving mechanism, class-incremental learning, adaptive aggregation

Summary:
In the domain of continual learning, a new approach called prompt-based continual learning is proposed. This method involves tuning small parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen, eliminating the need for rehearsal. The key challenge lies in effectively integrating task-specific knowledge into prompts. Existing methods either use fixed learned prompts or prompts generated from a task-shared space, limiting diversity. To address this limitation, a novel prompt-evolving mechanism is introduced, which dynamically aggregates base prompts and ensures diversity. A learnable probabilistic gate is incorporated to adaptively determine which layers to activate during the evolution process. The efficacy of this approach is validated on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, showcasing significant performance gains over existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods across all scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<div> Keywords: out-of-distribution detection, ensemble learning, CLIP, image recognition, robustness<br />
Summary:<br />
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for trustworthy image recognition systems. Traditional methods rely on single classifiers, limiting performance on ID data. This study introduces COOkeD, a heterogeneous ensemble combining closed-world, zero-shot CLIP, and linear probe classifiers. Despite its modular and post-hoc nature, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets. It shows robustness against label noise, covariate shift, and zero-shot shift scenarios, often overlooked in previous studies. By leveraging pre-trained VLMs, COOkeD introduces minimal overhead compared to standard classifier training. The availability of code on GitHub facilitates the adoption of COOkeD in image recognition tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.22576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier, leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier. We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based OOD detection methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various forms of unseen image degradation.

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model, which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

arXiv:2507.22607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Summary: 
The article introduces GALTraj, a method for improving data-driven trajectory prediction in autonomous driving systems. Unlike previous approaches that modified model architectures, GALTraj refines the training process to enhance the model's performance without structural changes. By deploying generative active learning, GALTraj actively identifies and augments rare tail samples where the model fails during training. The method focuses on generating diverse, realistic scenarios that preserve rare behaviors and traffic rules. Unlike previous simulation methods, GALTraj's tail-aware generation approach leverages tailored diffusion guidance to benefit long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experimental results on multiple trajectory datasets with popular backbones demonstrate significant performance improvements on tail samples and enhanced accuracy on head samples. GALTraj showcases the potential of simulator-driven augmentation for improving trajectory prediction in autonomous driving systems. 

<br /><br /> Summary: <div>

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD, Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on head samples.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation, particularly when dealing with missing modalities, remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key imaging modalities.

Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024 datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential, making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications.

The method achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance on global and localized metrics, as demonstrated on the Sketchy fashion dataset. The approach allows for unprecedented levels of design customization, as highlighted by qualitative examples and a human evaluation study.<br /><br />Summary: Fashion designers employ sketches and textual descriptions to convey intricate design ideas, and the LOTS approach enhances the generation of fashion images by incorporating both visual and textual elements through a step-based merging strategy. Using a Modularized Pair-Centric representation and a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase, LOTS achieves superior image generation results and enables a high degree of design customization, as evidenced by its performance on the Fashionpedia dataset and the creation of the Sketchy fashion dataset. This innovative approach bridges the gap between sketch-based and text-based generation methods in the field of fashion design. <div>

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material, texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a global description with paired localized sketch + text information for conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams, deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality, addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR channels.

Summary:
Our proposed graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints aims to improve 3D point cloud segmentation by considering both local and global structural dependencies within scenes. By constructing guiding graphs based on real-world object relationship statistics, our method enforces geometric plausibility and semantic consistency at the local level while maintaining the topological structure of the scene at the global level. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various models. <div>

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation. Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various models.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others, highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation models in anomaly detection.

<title>Image-Guided Shape-from-Template Using Mesh Inextensibility Constraints</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the 3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template. Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover, when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at https://github.com/dvttran/nsft.

<title>A Linear N-Point Solver for Structure and Motion from Asynchronous Tracks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently, event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at https://github.com/suhang99/AsyncTrack-Motion-Solver.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Advances in Generative AI have made video-level deepfake detection increasingly challenging, exposing the limitations of current detection techniques. In this paper, we present HOLA, our solution to the Video-Level Deepfake Detection track of 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. Inspired by the success of large-scale pre-training in the general domain, we first scale audio-visual self-supervised pre-training in the multimodal video-level deepfake detection, which leverages our self-built dataset of 1.81M samples, thereby leading to a unified two-stage framework. To be specific, HOLA features an iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual interactions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under the local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware cross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised singal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive experiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation studies to explore the crucial design factors of our introduced components. Remarkably, our HOLA ranks 1st, outperforming the second by 0.0476 AUC on the TestA set.

Abstract: Feature matching is a cornerstone task in computer vision, essential for applications such as image retrieval, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, and SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching, exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps. Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds, attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language tasks, underscore the evolution of feature matching to handle increasingly diverse data interactions.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency. The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information (past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of VOST through the lens of foundation models.

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers, posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of 0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available at: https://github.com/donglihe-hub/FetalCLIP-IQA.

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

arXiv:2507.22813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious "shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training. Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier; through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to 7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong prior assumptions about triggers.

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years, geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution, as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic parameter estimation in clinical practice.

<title>Bi-Level Optimization for Self-Supervised AI-Generated Face Detection</title>

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces. In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen generators.

<title>DepR: Depth Guided Single-view Scene Reconstruction with Instance-level Diffusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22825</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22825</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm. Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout. Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference. Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<title>ScreenCoder: Advancing Visual-to-Code Generation for Front-End Automation via Modular Multimodal Agents</title>

arXiv:2507.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/leigest519/ScreenCoder.

<title>CapRecover: A Cross-Modality Feature Inversion Attack Framework on Vision Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22828</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.22828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry, semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage, we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer. Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without additional training costs.

<title>TR-PTS: Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection for Efficient Tuning</title>

arXiv:2507.22872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%, respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality, demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant advancements, yet challenges remain in integrating multimodal information and deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore, we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on other related tasks.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&amp;E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automated segmentation of brain regions and classification of amyloid positivity using positron emission tomography (PET) images alone, without the need for structural MRI or CT. A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers of depth was trained and validated on a dataset of 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans, with an 130/20/50 train/validation/test split. Segmentation performance was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients across 30 brain regions, with scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.88, demonstrating high anatomical accuracy, particularly in subcortical structures. Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake within clinically relevant regions. Precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus, and lateral temporal cortex was assessed using normalized root mean square error, achieving values as low as 0.0011. Furthermore, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.98 for amyloid positivity based on regional uptake quantification, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99. These results highlight the model's potential for integration into PET only diagnostic pipelines, particularly in settings where structural imaging is not available. This approach reduces dependence on coregistration and manual delineation, enabling scalable, reliable, and reproducible analysis in clinical and research applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and extension to diverse PET tracers including C11 PiB and other F18 labeled compounds.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity -- remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning. Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) represents a transformative visualization approach for next-generation immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) displays, enabling precise wavefront modulation and naturally providing comprehensive physiological depth cues without the need for bulky optical assemblies. Despite significant advancements in computational algorithms enhancing image quality and achieving real-time generation, practical implementations of holographic near-eye displays (NEDs) continue to face substantial challenges arising from finite and dynamically varying pupil apertures, which degrade image quality and compromise user experience. In this study, we introduce an eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic NED. Our proposed method employs a customized spherical phase modulation strategy to generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, entirely eliminating the dependence on conventional optical eyepieces. Through the joint optimization of amplitude and phase distributions across these viewpoints, the method markedly mitigates image degradation due to finite pupil sampling and resolves inapparent depth cues induced by the spherical phase. The demonstrated method signifies a substantial advancement toward the realization of compact, lightweight, and flexible holographic NED systems, fulfilling stringent requirements for future VR/AR display technologies.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions, revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss functions, including CE, C\&amp;W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and robustness evaluation accuracy.

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity, demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

<title>Towards Blind Bitstream-corrupted Video Recovery via a Visual Foundation Model-driven Framework</title>

Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems, as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs, bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame, resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper, we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery. Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC) module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia communication and storage systems.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs with decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks. However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture, enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of approximately $45^\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and depth information at nearly $28^\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP) framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a 1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012, ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 69.1%.

Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague. The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map (DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset. The open-source code of this work is released at: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Low-Cost-Accurate-Radar-Based-Human-Motion-Direction-Determination.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the creation of a new form of digital art: optical illusions--visual tricks that create different perceptions of reality. However, adversaries may misuse such techniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages into harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work, we take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful illusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation models. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are hateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or subtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models (VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection accuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs. We further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which mainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary layer of information, i.e., hidden messages. To address this risk, we explore preliminary mitigation measures and identify the most effective approaches from the perspectives of image transformations and training-level strategies.

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections, refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a 3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases: self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

Abstract: Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and appearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common form. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant limitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and remote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB images to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible to environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model stability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel pipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back, compensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine morphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the subtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an adaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both patch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based Hybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF) module is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our depth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different evaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%, respectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we integrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation. This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation, achieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients (called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide the train and test datasets for the community.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a powerful and popular technique for personalization, enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained image generation models for specific tasks without comprehensive retraining. While employing individual pre-trained LoRA models excels at representing single concepts, such as those representing a specific dog or a cat, utilizing multiple LoRA models to capture a variety of concepts in a single image still poses a significant challenge. Existing methods often fall short, primarily because the attention mechanisms within different LoRA models overlap, leading to scenarios where one concept may be completely ignored (e.g., omitting the dog) or where concepts are incorrectly combined (e.g., producing an image of two cats instead of one cat and one dog). We introduce CLoRA, a training-free approach that addresses these limitations by updating the attention maps of multiple LoRA models at test-time, and leveraging the attention maps to create semantic masks for fusing latent representations. This enables the generation of composite images that accurately reflect the characteristics of each LoRA. Our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that CLoRA significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-concept image generation using LoRAs.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.

Abstract: Standard convolutions are prevalent in image processing and deep learning, but their fixed kernels limits adaptability. Several deformation strategies of the reference kernel grid have been proposed. Yet, they lack a unified theoretical framework. By returning to a metric perspective for images, now seen as two-dimensional manifolds equipped with notions of local and geodesic distances, either symmetric (Riemannian) or not (Finsler), we provide a unifying principle: the kernel positions are samples of unit balls of implicit metrics. With this new perspective, we also propose metric convolutions, a novel approach that samples unit balls from explicit signal-dependent metrics, providing interpretable operators with geometric regularisation. This framework, compatible with gradient-based optimisation, can directly replace existing convolutions applied to either input images or deep features of neural networks. Metric convolutions typically require fewer parameters and provide better generalisation. Our approach shows competitive performance in standard denoising and classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the Cooperative Network Architecture (CNA), a model that represents sensory signals using structured, recurrently connected networks of neurons, termed "nets." Nets are dynamically assembled from overlapping net fragments, which are learned based on statistical regularities in sensory input. This architecture offers robustness to noise, deformation, and out-of-distribution data, addressing challenges in current vision systems from a novel perspective. We demonstrate that net fragments can be learned without supervision and flexibly recombined to encode novel patterns, enabling figure completion and resilience to noise. Our findings establish CNA as a promising paradigm for developing neural representations that integrate local feature processing with global structure formation, providing a foundation for future research on invariant object recognition.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, specialized computer vision techniques, notably transformers grounded in attention mechanisms and residual networks employing skip connections, have been instrumental in advancing performance. Nonetheless, previous models often falter when segmenting small, irregularly shaped tumors. To this end, we introduce SMAFormer, an efficient, Transformer-based architecture that fuses multiple attention mechanisms for enhanced segmentation of small tumors and organs. SMAFormer can capture both local and global features for medical image segmentation. The architecture comprises two pivotal components. First, a Synergistic Multi-Attention (SMA) Transformer block is proposed, which has the benefits of Pixel Attention, Channel Attention, and Spatial Attention for feature enrichment. Second, addressing the challenge of information loss incurred during attention mechanism transitions and feature fusion, we design a Feature Fusion Modulator. This module bolsters the integration between the channel and spatial attention by mitigating reshaping-induced information attrition. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on various medical image segmentation tasks, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/CXH-Research/SMAFormer.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in caption generation, existing evaluation metrics often fail to capture the full quality or fine-grained details of captions. This is mainly due to their reliance on non-specific human-written references or noisy pre-training data. Still, finding an effective metric is crucial not only for captions evaluation but also for the generation phase. Metrics can indeed play a key role in the fine-tuning stage of captioning models, ultimately enhancing the quality of the generated captions. In this paper, we propose PAC-S++, a learnable metric that leverages the CLIP model, pre-trained on both web-collected and cleaned data and regularized through additional pairs of generated visual and textual positive samples. Exploiting this stronger and curated pre-training, we also apply PAC-S++ as a reward in the Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) stage typically employed to fine-tune captioning models. Extensive experiments on different image and video datasets highlight the effectiveness of PAC-S++ compared to popular metrics for the task, including its sensitivity to object hallucinations. Furthermore, we show that integrating PAC-S++ into the fine-tuning stage of a captioning model results in semantically richer captions with fewer repetitions and grammatical errors. Evaluations on out-of-domain benchmarks further demonstrate the efficacy of our fine-tuning approach in enhancing model capabilities. Source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/pacscore.

Abstract: Existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are largely limited to processing short, seconds-long videos and struggle with generating coherent descriptions for extended video spanning minutes or more. Long video description introduces new challenges, such as consistent character identification and plot-level descriptions incorporating both visual and audio information. To address these, we figure out audio-visual character identification, matching character names to each dialogue, as a key factor. We propose StoryTeller, a system for generating dense descriptions of long videos, incorporating both low-level visual concepts and high-level plot information. StoryTeller uses a multimodal large language model that integrates visual, audio, and text modalities to perform audio-visual character identification on minute-long video clips. The results are then fed into a LVLM to enhance consistency of video description. We validate our approach on movie description tasks and introduce MovieStory101, a dataset with dense descriptions for three-minute movie clips. To evaluate long video descriptions, we create StoryQA, a large set of multiple-choice questions for MovieStory101 test set. We assess descriptions by inputting them into GPT-4 to answer these questions, using accuracy as an automatic evaluation metric. Experiments show that StoryTeller outperforms all open and closed-source baselines on StoryQA, achieving 9.5% higher accuracy than the strongest baseline, Gemini-1.5-pro, and demonstrating a +15.56% advantage in human side-by-side evaluations. Additionally, incorporating audio-visual character identification from StoryTeller improves the performance of all video description models, with Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o showing relative improvement of 5.5% and 13.0%, respectively, in accuracy on StoryQA.

Abstract: Transformer-based multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds due to their structure or other issues. To address this problem, we revisited the Joint Detection and Tracking (JDT) method by looking back at past approaches. By integrating the original JDT approach with some advanced theories, this paper employs an efficient method of information transfer between frames on the DETR, constructing a fast and novel JDT-type MOT framework: FastTrackTr. Thanks to the superiority of this information transfer method, our approach not only reduces the number of queries required during tracking but also avoids the excessive introduction of network structures, ensuring model simplicity. Experimental results indicate that our method has the potential to achieve real-time tracking and exhibits competitive tracking accuracy across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Motion controllability is crucial in video synthesis. However, most previous methods are limited to single control types, and combining them often results in logical conflicts. In this paper, we propose a disentangled and unified framework, namely I2VControl, to overcome the logical conflicts. We rethink camera control, object dragging, and motion brush, reformulating all tasks into a consistent representation based on point trajectories, each managed by a dedicated formulation. Accordingly, we propose a spatial partitioning strategy, where each unit is assigned to a concomitant control category, enabling diverse control types to be dynamically orchestrated within a single synthesis pipeline without conflicts. Furthermore, we design an adapter structure that functions as a plug-in for pre-trained models and is agnostic to specific model architectures. We conduct extensive experiments, achieving excellent performance on various control tasks, and our method further facilitates user-driven creative combinations, enhancing innovation and creativity.

Abstract: Visual object counting is a fundamental computer vision task underpinning numerous real-world applications, from cell counting in biomedicine to traffic and wildlife monitoring. However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.

Abstract: We introduce FOF-X for real-time reconstruction of detailed human geometry from a single image. Balancing real-time speed against high-quality results is a persistent challenge, mainly due to the high computational demands of existing 3D representations. To address this, we propose Fourier Occupancy Field (FOF), an efficient 3D representation by learning the Fourier series. The core of FOF is to factorize a 3D occupancy field into a 2D vector field, retaining topology and spatial relationships within the 3D domain while facilitating compatibility with 2D convolutional neural networks. Such a representation bridges the gap between 3D and 2D domains, enabling the integration of human parametric models as priors and enhancing the reconstruction robustness. Based on FOF, we design a new reconstruction framework, FOF-X, to avoid the performance degradation caused by texture and lighting. This enables our real-time reconstruction system to better handle the domain gap between training images and real images. Additionally, in FOF-X, we enhance the inter-conversion algorithms between FOF and mesh representations with a Laplacian constraint and an automaton-based discontinuity matcher, improving both quality and robustness. We validate the strengths of our approach on different datasets and real-captured data, where FOF-X achieves new state-of-the-art results. The code has already been released for research purposes at https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/FOFX/index.html.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the advantage of global modeling capabilities, prompting widespread integration of large-kernel convolutions for enlarging the effective receptive field (ERF). However, the quadratic scaling of parameter count and computational complexity (FLOPs) with respect to kernel size poses significant efficiency and optimization challenges. This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive decomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency representations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear relationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines the effective receptive field $k\times 2^\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\ell$ levels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF expansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only $\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the exponential growth ($4^\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions. RecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar FLOPs. This innovation provides a promising avenue towards designing efficient and compact networks across various modalities. Codes and models can be found at https://github.com/suous/RecNeXt.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic human-object interaction motions is a critical problem in VR/AR and human animation. Unlike the commonly studied scenarios involving a single human or hand interacting with one object, we address a more generic multi-body setting with arbitrary numbers of humans, hands, and objects. This complexity introduces significant challenges in synchronizing motions due to the high correlations and mutual influences among bodies. To address these challenges, we introduce SyncDiff, a novel method for multi-body interaction synthesis using a synchronized motion diffusion strategy. SyncDiff employs a single diffusion model to capture the joint distribution of multi-body motions. To enhance motion fidelity, we propose a frequency-domain motion decomposition scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new set of alignment scores to emphasize the synchronization of different body motions. SyncDiff jointly optimizes both data sample likelihood and alignment likelihood through an explicit synchronization strategy. Extensive experiments across four datasets with various multi-body configurations demonstrate the superiority of SyncDiff over existing state-of-the-art motion synthesis methods.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have become a promising approach to enhancing perception and decision-making in autonomous driving. The gap remains in applying VLMs to understand complex scenarios interacting with pedestrians and efficient vehicle deployment. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation method that transfers knowledge from large-scale vision-language foundation models to efficient vision networks, and we apply it to pedestrian behavior prediction and scene understanding tasks, achieving promising results in generating more diverse and comprehensive semantic attributes. We also utilize multiple pre-trained models and ensemble techniques to boost the model's performance. We further examined the effectiveness of the model after knowledge distillation; the results show significant metric improvements in open-vocabulary perception and trajectory prediction tasks, which can potentially enhance the end-to-end performance of autonomous driving.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with preference optimization is valuable for human-annotated datasets, but the heavy cost of manual data collection limits scalability. Using reward models offers an alternative, however, current preference optimization methods fall short in exploiting the rich information, as they only consider pairwise preference distribution. Furthermore, they lack generalization to multi-preference scenarios and struggle to handle inconsistencies between rewards. To address this, we present Calibrated Preference Optimization (CaPO), a novel method to align T2I diffusion models by incorporating the general preference from multiple reward models without human annotated data. The core of our approach involves a reward calibration method to approximate the general preference by computing the expected win-rate against the samples generated by the pretrained models. Additionally, we propose a frontier-based pair selection method that effectively manages the multi-preference distribution by selecting pairs from Pareto frontiers. Finally, we use regression loss to fine-tune diffusion models to match the difference between calibrated rewards of a selected pair. Experimental results show that CaPO consistently outperforms prior methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in both single and multi-reward settings validated by evaluation on T2I benchmarks, including GenEval and T2I-Compbench.

Abstract: Astronauts take thousands of photos of Earth per day from the International Space Station, which, once localized on Earth's surface, are used for a multitude of tasks, ranging from climate change research to disaster management. The localization process, which has been performed manually for decades, has recently been approached through image retrieval solutions: given an astronaut photo, find its most similar match among a large database of geo-tagged satellite images, in a task called Astronaut Photography Localization (APL). Yet, existing APL approaches are trained only using satellite images, without taking advantage of the millions open-source astronaut photos. In this work we present the first APL pipeline capable of leveraging astronaut photos for training. We first produce full localization information for 300,000 manually weakly labeled astronaut photos through an automated pipeline, and then use these images to train a model, called AstroLoc. AstroLoc learns a robust representation of Earth's surface features through two losses: astronaut photos paired with their matching satellite counterparts in a pairwise loss, and a second loss on clusters of satellite imagery weighted by their relevance to astronaut photography via unsupervised mining. We find that AstroLoc achieves a staggering 35% average improvement in recall@1 over previous SOTA, pushing the limits of existing datasets with a recall@100 consistently over 99%. Finally, we note that AstroLoc, without any fine-tuning, provides excellent results for related tasks like the lost-in-space satellite problem and historical space imagery localization.

Abstract: The complex application scenarios have raised critical requirements for precise and generalizable gaze estimation methods. Recently, the pre-trained CLIP has achieved remarkable performance on various vision tasks, but its potentials have not been fully exploited in gaze estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel Differential Contrastive Training strategy, which boosts gaze estimation performance with the help of the CLIP. Accordingly, a Differential Contrastive Gaze Estimation network (DCGaze) composed of a Visual Appearance-aware branch and a Semantic Differential-aware branch is introduced. The Visual Appearance-aware branch is essentially a primary gaze estimation network and it incorporates an Adaptive Feature-refinement Unit (AFU) and a Double-head Gaze Regressor (DGR), which both help the primary network to extract informative and gaze-related appearance features. Moreover, the Semantic Difference-aware branch is designed on the basis of the CLIP's text encoder to reveal the semantic difference of gazes. This branch could further empower the Visual Appearance-aware branch with the capability of characterizing the gaze-related semantic information. Extensive experimental results on four challenging datasets over within and cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our DCGaze.The code is available at https://github.com/LinZhang-bjtu/DCGaze.

Abstract: The advancement of remote sensing, including satellite systems, facilitates the continuous acquisition of remote sensing imagery globally, introducing novel challenges for achieving open-world tasks. Deployed models need to continuously adjust to a constant influx of new data, which frequently exhibits diverse shifts from the data encountered during the training phase. To effectively handle the new data, models are required to detect semantic shifts, adapt to covariate shifts, and continuously update their parameters without forgetting learned knowledge, as has been considered in works on a variety of open-world tasks. However, existing studies are typically conducted within a single dataset to simulate realistic conditions, with a lack of large-scale benchmarks capable of evaluating multiple open-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenEarthSensing (OES)}, a large-scale fine-grained benchmark for open-world remote sensing. OES includes 189 scene and object categories, covering the vast majority of potential semantic shifts that may occur in the real world. Additionally, to provide a more comprehensive testbed for evaluating the generalization performance, OES encompasses five data domains with significant covariate shifts, including two RGB satellite domains, one RGB aerial domain, one multispectral RGB domain, and one infrared domain. We evaluate the baselines and existing methods for diverse tasks on OES, demonstrating that it serves as a meaningful and challenging benchmark for open-world remote sensing. The proposed dataset OES is available at https://haiv-lab.github.io/OES.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have made impressive strides in image captioning, VQA, and video comprehension, yet they still struggle with the intricate temporal and spatial cues found in comics. To address this gap, we introduce ComicsPAP, a large-scale benchmark designed for comic strip understanding. Comprising over 100k samples and organized into 5 subtasks under a Pick-a-Panel framework, ComicsPAP demands models to identify the missing panel in a sequence. Our evaluations, conducted under both multi-image and single-image protocols, reveal that current state-of-the-art LMMs perform near chance on these tasks, underscoring significant limitations in capturing sequential and contextual dependencies. To close the gap, we adapted LMMs for comic strip understanding, obtaining better results on ComicsPAP than 10x bigger models, demonstrating that ComicsPAP offers a robust resource to drive future research in multimodal comic comprehension.

Abstract: Visual Mamba networks (ViMs) extend the selective state space model (Mamba) to various vision tasks and demonstrate significant potential. As a promising compression technique, vector quantization (VQ) decomposes network weights into codebooks and assignments, significantly reducing memory usage and computational latency, thereby enabling the deployment of ViMs on edge devices. Although existing VQ methods have achieved extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 3-bit, 2-bit, and 1-bit) in convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based networks, directly applying these methods to ViMs results in unsatisfactory accuracy. We identify several key challenges: 1) The weights of Mamba-based blocks in ViMs contain numerous outliers, significantly amplifying quantization errors. 2) When applied to ViMs, the latest VQ methods suffer from excessive memory consumption, lengthy calibration procedures, and suboptimal performance in the search for optimal codewords. In this paper, we propose ViM-VQ, an efficient post-training vector quantization method tailored for ViMs. ViM-VQ consists of two innovative components: 1) a fast convex combination optimization algorithm that efficiently updates both the convex combinations and the convex hulls to search for optimal codewords, and 2) an incremental vector quantization strategy that incrementally confirms optimal codewords to mitigate truncation errors. Experimental results demonstrate that ViM-VQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-bit quantization across various visual tasks.

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) has become a cornerstone in modern computer graphics, enabling realistic material representation and lighting interactions in 3D scenes. In this paper, we present MaterialMVP, a novel end-to-end model for generating PBR textures from 3D meshes and image prompts, addressing key challenges in multi-view material synthesis. Our approach leverages Reference Attention to extract and encode informative latent from the input reference images, enabling intuitive and controllable texture generation. We also introduce a Consistency-Regularized Training strategy to enforce stability across varying viewpoints and illumination conditions, ensuring illumination-invariant and geometrically consistent results. Additionally, we propose Dual-Channel Material Generation, which separately optimizes albedo and metallic-roughness (MR) textures while maintaining precise spatial alignment with the input images through Multi-Channel Aligned Attention. Learnable material embeddings are further integrated to capture the distinct properties of albedo and MR. Experimental results demonstrate that our model generates PBR textures with realistic behavior across diverse lighting scenarios, outperforming existing methods in both consistency and quality for scalable 3D asset creation.

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D/4D scene generation emphasizes the importance of physical alignment throughout video generation and scene reconstruction. However, existing methods improve the alignment separately at each stage, making it difficult to manage subtle misalignments arising from another stage. Here, we present SteerX, a zero-shot inference-time steering method that unifies scene reconstruction into the generation process, tilting data distributions toward better geometric alignment. To this end, we introduce two geometric reward functions for 3D/4D scene generation by using pose-free feed-forward scene reconstruction models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SteerX in improving 3D/4D scene generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves high-fidelity rendering with fast real-time performance, but existing methods rely on offline training after full Structure-from-Motion (SfM) processing. In contrast, this work introduces Gaussian on-the-fly Splatting (abbreviated as On-the-Fly GS), a progressive framework enabling near real-time 3DGS optimization during image capture. As each image arrives, its pose and sparse points are updated via On-the-Fly SfM, and newly optimized Gaussians are immediately integrated into the 3DGS field. To achieve this, we propose a progressive Local & Semi-Global optimization to prioritize the new image and its neighbors by their corresponding overlapping relationship, allowing the new image and its overlapping images to get more training. To further stabilize training across previous and new images, an adaptive learning rate schedule balances the iterations and the learning rate. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our On-the-Fly GS reduces training time significantly, optimizing each new image in seconds with minimal rendering loss, offering one of the first practical steps toward rapid, progressive 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, the integration of roadside perception systems is essential for overcoming occlusion challenges and enhancing the safety of Vulnerable Road Users(VRUs). While LiDAR and visual (RGB) sensors are commonly used, thermal imaging remains underrepresented in datasets, despite its acknowledged advantages for VRU detection in extreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we present R-LiViT, the first dataset to combine LiDAR, RGB, and thermal imaging from a roadside perspective, with a strong focus on VRUs. R-LiViT captures three intersections during both day and night, ensuring a diverse dataset. It includes 10,000 LiDAR frames and 2,400 temporally and spatially aligned RGB and thermal images across 150 traffic scenarios, with 7 and 8 annotated classes respectively, providing a comprehensive resource for tasks such as object detection and tracking. The dataset and the code for reproducing our evaluation results are made publicly available.

<title>Exploring Textual Semantics Diversity for Image Transmission in Semantic Communication Systems using Visual Language Model</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning has brought reforms and challenges to traditional communication systems. Semantic communication has appeared as an effective strategy to effectively extract relevant semantic signals semantic segmentation labels and image features for image transmission. However, the insufficient number of extracted semantic features of images will potentially result in a low reconstruction accuracy, which hinders the practical applications and still remains challenging for solving. In order to fill this gap, this letter proposes a multi-text transmission semantic communication (Multi-SC) system, which uses the visual language model (VLM) to assist in the transmission of image semantic signals. Unlike previous image transmission semantic communication systems, the proposed system divides the image into multiple blocks and extracts multiple text information from the image using a modified large language and visual assistant (LLaVA), and combines semantic segmentation tags with semantic text for image recovery. Simulation results show that the proposed text semantics diversity scheme can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy compared with related works.

<title>Fine-Tuning Visual Autoregressive Models for Subject-Driven Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have enabled numerous practical applications, including subject-driven generation, which fine-tunes pretrained models to capture subject semantics from only a few examples. While diffusion-based models produce high-quality images, their extensive denoising steps result in significant computational overhead, limiting real-world applicability. Visual autoregressive (VAR) models, which predict next-scale tokens rather than spatially adjacent ones, offer significantly faster inference suitable for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose the first VAR-based approach for subject-driven generation. However, naive fine-tuning VAR leads to computational overhead, language drift, and reduced diversity. To address these challenges, we introduce selective layer tuning to reduce complexity and prior distillation to mitigate language drift. Additionally, we found that the early stages have a greater influence on the generation of subject than the latter stages, which merely synthesize minor details. Based on this finding, we propose scale-wise weighted tuning, which prioritizes coarser resolutions for promoting the model to focus on the subject-relevant information instead of local details. Extensive experiments validate that our method significantly outperforms diffusion-based baselines across various metrics and demonstrates its practical usage.

Abstract: Motion retargeting seeks to faithfully replicate the spatio-temporal motion characteristics of a source character onto a target character with a different body shape. Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the conventional practice in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) of using averaged class-wise text embeddings, which are typically obtained by encoding each class name with multiple templates (e.g., a photo of , a sketch of a ). We investigate the impact of templates for OVSS, and find that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers--which we refer to as class-experts--that significantly outperform the conventional averaged classifier. First, to identify these class-experts, we introduce a novel approach that estimates them without any labeled data or training. By leveraging the class-wise prediction entropy of single-template classifiers, we select those yielding the lowest entropy as the most reliable class-experts. Second, we combine the outputs of class-experts in a new fusion process. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is orthogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering an improvement without the need for additional labels or training. Extensive experiments show that FLOSS consistently enhances state-of-the-art OVSS models, generalizes well across datasets with different distribution shifts, and delivers substantial improvements in low-data scenarios where only a few unlabeled images are available. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/FLOSS .

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to adapt to new tasks without parameter updates, using a few demonstrations from a large support set. However, selecting informative demonstrations leads to high computational and memory costs. While some methods explore selecting a small and representative coreset in the text classification, evaluating all support set samples remains costly, and discarded samples lead to unnecessary information loss. These methods may also be less effective for image classification due to differences in feature spaces. Given these limitations, we propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that leverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We introduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor for identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies. By leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of selected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve into a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive experiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image classification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\%. Notably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong performance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework for resource-constrained real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation predicts per-pixel depth from a single RGB image. While recent methods have shown promise by leveraging diffusion models, they often struggle to accurately reconstruct far-range regions. This difficulty stems from two compounding factors. First, the standard spatially uniform diffusion objective fails to adapt to the varying frequency content across a depth map. Second, the long-tail depth distribution heavily biases models toward near-range regions. To address these limitations, we introduce VistaDepth, a novel framework named for its ability to accurately reconstruct far-range vistas, which integrates adaptive frequency-domain feature processing with an adaptive loss-balancing mechanism into the diffusion pipeline. Central to our approach is the Latent Frequency Modulation module, which dynamically refines spectral responses in the latent feature space, effectively preserving structural detail. Additionally, we introduce BiasMap, a mechanism that applies adaptive weights directly to the diffusion loss in the latent space, focusing supervision on under-represented far-range regions. These innovations collectively achieve superior depth perception performance across near- and far-range depths while preserving fine detail. Experiments show that VistaDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffusion-based MDE, particularly excelling in reconstructing detailed and accurate depth in far-range regions.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, combining complementary modalities like histology images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports, eliminating paired data requirement. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the target unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference time, only the improved vision model is used, with minimal computational overhead, enabling efficient pairing-free multimodal deployment. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of paired data training or inference-time complexity.

Abstract: The success of face recognition (FR) systems has led to serious privacy concerns due to potential unauthorized surveillance and user tracking on social networks. Existing methods for enhancing privacy fail to generate natural face images that can protect facial privacy. In this paper, we propose diffusion-based adversarial identity manipulation (DiffAIM) to generate natural and highly transferable adversarial faces against malicious FR systems. To be specific, we manipulate facial identity within the low-dimensional latent space of a diffusion model. This involves iteratively injecting gradient-based adversarial identity guidance during the reverse diffusion process, progressively steering the generation toward the desired adversarial faces. The guidance is optimized for identity convergence towards a target while promoting semantic divergence from the source, facilitating effective impersonation while maintaining visual naturalness. We further incorporate structure-preserving regularization to preserve facial structure consistency during manipulation. Extensive experiments on both face verification and identification tasks demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art, DiffAIM achieves stronger black-box attack transferability while maintaining superior visual quality. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for commercial FR APIs, including Face++ and Aliyun.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of diffusion-based malicious image manipulation, existing proactive defense methods struggle to safeguard images against tampering under unknown conditions. To address this, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive defense approach that achieves protection comprising three novel modules. First, we introduce a multi-level deep feature extractor to obtain intricate features from the diffusion denoising process, enhancing protective effectiveness. Second, we design a multi-scale, semantic-preserving data augmentation technique to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions. Finally, we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to bolster protection against manipulations guided by diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments on InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ demonstrate that Anti-Inpainting effectively defends against diffusion-based inpainters under unknown conditions. Additionally, our approach demonstrates robustness against various image purification methods and transferability across different diffusion model versions.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has emerged as a crucial research direction, as integrating textual and visual information can substantially enhance performance in tasks such as classification, retrieval, and scene understanding. Despite advances with large pre-trained models, existing approaches often suffer from insufficient cross-modal interactions and rigid fusion strategies, failing to fully harness the complementary strengths of different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Co-AttenDWG, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and expert fusion. Our approach first projects textual and visual features into a shared embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention mechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities. This is further strengthened by a dimension-wise gating network, which adaptively modulates feature contributions at the channel level to emphasize salient information. In parallel, dual-path encoders independently refine modality-specific representations, while an additional cross-attention layer aligns the modalities further. The resulting features are aggregated via an expert fusion module that integrates learned gating and self-attention, yielding a robust unified representation. Experimental results on the MIMIC and SemEval Memotion 1.0 datasets show that Co-AttenDWG achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior cross-modal alignment, highlighting its effectiveness for diverse multi-modal applications.

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

Abstract: The goal of point cloud assembly is to reconstruct a complete 3D shape by aligning multiple point cloud pieces. This work presents a novel equivariant solver for assembly tasks based on flow matching models. We first theoretically show that the key to learning equivariant distributions via flow matching is to learn related vector fields. Based on this result, we propose an assembly model, called equivariant diffusion assembly (Eda), which learns related vector fields conditioned on the input pieces. We further construct an equivariant path for Eda, which guarantees high data efficiency of the training process. Our numerical results show that Eda is highly competitive on practical datasets, and it can even handle the challenging situation where the input pieces are non-overlapped.

<title>Seed Selection for Human-Oriented Image Reconstruction via Guided Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A recent diffusion-based approach avoids this by generating human-oriented images from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. However, it utilizes a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To reduce the computational cost, selection is performed based on intermediate outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses a single random seed without selection, across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to person identification using hand images, designed specifically for criminal investigations. The method is particularly valuable in serious crimes such as sexual abuse, where hand images are often the only identifiable evidence available. Our proposed method, CLIP-HandID, leverages a pre-trained foundational vision-language model - CLIP - to efficiently learn discriminative deep feature representations from hand images (input to CLIP's image encoder) using textual prompts as semantic guidance. Since hand images are labeled with indexes rather than text descriptions, we employ a textual inversion network to learn pseudo-tokens that encode specific visual contexts or appearance attributes. These learned pseudo-tokens are then incorporated into textual prompts, which are fed into CLIP's text encoder to leverage its multi-modal reasoning and enhance generalization for identification. Through extensive evaluations on two large, publicly available hand datasets with multi-ethnic representation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

<title>FOCoOp: Enhancing Out-of-Distribution Robustness in Federated Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16218</link>

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap, we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework, which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts, local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization. Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients, i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts. The project is available at GitHub.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1 lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration. Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/JianghaiSCU/SIED.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits. First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without voting strategy.

Abstract: While recent online HD mapping methods relieve burdened offline pipelines and solve map freshness, they remain limited by perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion in dense traffic, and an inability to fuse multi-agent observations. We propose RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1) Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2) probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3) real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously. Our source-code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RTMap.

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$ scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset, TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving higher recall. Our code is accessible at \href{https://github.com/Laka-3DV/TurboReg}{\texttt{TurboReg}}.

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce \underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o \underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection. 3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%, and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA, respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images. These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and exploration for embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models show difficulty perception misaligned with human intuition, exhibit dramatic 2Dto-3D performance cliffs, default to formulaic derivation over visualization, and paradoxically suffer performance degradation from Chain-of-Thought prompting in open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and view synthesis are foundational problems in computer vision, graphics, and immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and digital twins. Traditional methods rely on computationally intensive iterative optimization in a complex chain, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in feed-forward approaches, driven by deep learning, have revolutionized this field by enabling fast and generalizable 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. This survey offers a comprehensive review of feed-forward techniques for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, with a taxonomy according to the underlying representation architectures including point cloud, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics, and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We conclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for future work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance the state of the art in 3D vision.

Abstract: This paper describes continuous-space methodologies to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient between an ellipsoidal robot model and an environment surface modeled as a set of Gaussian distributions. Continuous-space collision probability estimation is critical for uncertainty-aware motion planning. Most collision detection and avoidance approaches assume the robot is modeled as a sphere, but ellipsoidal representations provide tighter approximations and enable navigation in cluttered and narrow spaces. State-of-the-art methods derive the Euclidean distance and gradient by processing raw point clouds, which is computationally expensive for large workspaces. Recent advances in Gaussian surface modeling (e.g. mixture models, splatting) enable compressed and high-fidelity surface representations. Few methods exist to estimate continuous-space occupancy from such models. They require Gaussians to model free space and are unable to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient for an ellipsoidal robot. The proposed methods bridge this gap by extending prior work in ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid Euclidean distance and collision probability estimation to Gaussian surface models. A geometric blending approach is also proposed to improve collision probability estimation. The approaches are evaluated with numerical 2D and 3D experiments using real-world point cloud data. Methods for efficient calculation of these quantities are demonstrated to execute within a few microseconds per ellipsoid pair using a single-thread on low-power CPUs of modern embedded computers

Abstract: Existing learning-based denoising methods typically train models to generalize the image prior from large-scale datasets, suffering from the variability in noise distributions encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a new perspective on the denoising challenge by highlighting the distinct separation between noise and image priors. This insight forms the basis for our development of conditional optimization framework, designed to overcome the constraints of traditional denoising framework. To this end, we introduce a Locally Noise Prior Estimation (LoNPE) algorithm, which accurately estimates the noise prior directly from a single raw noisy image. This estimation acts as an explicit prior representation of the camera sensor's imaging environment, distinct from the image prior of scenes. Additionally, we design an auxiliary learnable LoNPE network tailored for practical application to sRGB noisy images. Leveraging the estimated noise prior, we present a novel Conditional Denoising Transformer (Condformer), by incorporating the noise prior into a conditional self-attention mechanism. This integration allows the Condformer to segment the optimization process into multiple explicit subspaces, significantly enhancing the model's generalization and flexibility. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/YuanfeiHuang/Condformer.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures.

Abstract: Ring artifacts are prevalent in 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) due to non-ideal responses of X-ray detectors, substantially affecting image quality and diagnostic reliability. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) ring artifact reduction (RAR) methods rely on supervised learning with large-scale paired CT datasets. While effective in-domain, supervised methods tend to struggle to fully capture the physical characteristics of ring artifacts, leading to pronounced performance drops in complex real-world acquisitions. Moreover, their scalability to 3D CBCT is limited by high memory demands. In this work, we propose Riner, a new unsupervised RAR method. Based on a theoretical analysis of ring artifact formation, we reformulate RAR as a multi-parameter inverse problem, where the non-ideal responses of X-ray detectors are parameterized as solvable physical variables. Using a new differentiable forward model, Riner can jointly learn the implicit neural representation of artifact-free images and estimate the physical parameters directly from CT measurements, without external training data. Additionally, Riner is memory-friendly due to its ray-based optimization, enhancing its usability in large-scale 3D CBCT. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show Riner outperforms existing SOTA supervised methods.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INR) have been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and low computational efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and models are available at https://github.com/ChrisDud0257/GSASR.

Abstract: Effective segmentation is fundamental for quantitative medical imaging; however, foundation segmentation models remain insufficiently evaluated for accuracy and biomarker fidelity across the diverse anatomical contexts and imaging protocols encountered in musculoskeletal (MSK) MRI. We evaluate three widely used segmentation models (SAM, SAM2, MedSAM) across eleven MSK MRI datasets spanning the knee, hip, spine, shoulder, and thigh. Our framework assesses both zero-shot and finetuned performance, with attention to segmentation accuracy, generalizability across imaging protocols, and reliability of derived quantitative biomarkers. Finetuned models showed consistent agreement with expert measurements for biomarkers including cartilage thickness, disc height, muscle volume, and compositional T1rho/T2 values. Automated prompting through the AutoLabel system enabled scalable segmentation, with moderate trade-offs in accuracy. As proof of concept, we applied the validated system to (i) a three-stage knee MRI triage cascade and (ii) a longitudinal landmark model that predicts total knee replacement and incident osteoarthritis. The framework offers a transparent method for benchmarking segmentation tools and connecting model performance to clinical imaging priorities.

Abstract: Objectives:  High classification accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural MRI has been achieved using deep neural networks, yet the specific image features contributing to these decisions remain unclear. In this study, the contributions of T1-weighted (T1w) gray-white matter texture, volumetric information, and preprocessing -- particularly skull-stripping -- were systematically assessed.
  Methods: A dataset of 990 matched T1w MRIs from AD patients and cognitively normal controls from the ADNI database were used. Preprocessing was varied through skull-stripping and intensity binarization to isolate texture and shape contributions. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on each configuration, and classification performance was compared using exact McNemar tests with discrete Bonferroni-Holm correction. Feature relevance was analyzed using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, image similarity metrics, and spectral clustering of relevance maps.
  Results: Despite substantial differences in image content, classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity remained stable across preprocessing conditions. Models trained on binarized images preserved performance, indicating minimal reliance on gray-white matter texture. Instead, volumetric features -- particularly brain contours introduced through skull-stripping -- were consistently used by the models.
  Conclusions: This behavior reflects a shortcut learning phenomenon, where preprocessing artifacts act as potentially unintended cues. The resulting Clever Hans effect emphasizes the critical importance of interpretability tools to reveal hidden biases and to ensure robust and trustworthy deep learning in medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) models, audio-visual-to-audio-visual (AV2AV) translation still faces a critical challenge: maintaining speaker consistency between the original and translated vocal and facial features. To address this issue, we propose a conditional flow matching (CFM) zero-shot audio-visual renderer that utilizes strong dual guidance from both audio and visual modalities. By leveraging multimodal guidance with CFM, our model robustly preserves speaker-specific characteristics and enhances zero-shot AV2AV translation abilities. For the audio modality, we enhance the CFM process by integrating robust speaker embeddings with x-vectors, which serve to bolster speaker consistency. Additionally, we convey emotional nuances to the face rendering module. The guidance provided by both audio and visual cues remains independent of semantic or linguistic content, allowing our renderer to effectively handle zero-shot translation tasks for monolingual speakers in different languages. We empirically demonstrate that the inclusion of high-quality mel-spectrograms conditioned on facial information not only enhances the quality of the synthesized speech but also positively influences facial generation, leading to overall performance improvements in LSE and FID score. Our code is available at https://github.com/Peter-SungwooCho/MAVFlow.

Abstract: This study presents Flower Pose Estimation (FloPE), a real-time flower pose estimation framework for computationally constrained robotic pollination systems. Robotic pollination has been proposed to supplement natural pollination to ensure global food security due to the decreased population of natural pollinators. However, flower pose estimation for pollination is challenging due to natural variability, flower clusters, and high accuracy demands due to the flowers' fragility when pollinating. This method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate photorealistic synthetic datasets with precise pose annotations, enabling effective knowledge distillation from a high-capacity teacher model to a lightweight student model for efficient inference. The approach was evaluated on both single and multi-arm robotic platforms, achieving a mean pose estimation error of 0.6 cm and 19.14 degrees within a low computational cost. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of FloPE, achieving up to 78.75% pollination success rate and outperforming prior robotic pollination techniques.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices. Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding. We will release corresponding artifacts at https://microsoft.github.io/FIVE-UI-Evol/ .

Abstract: We present TartanGround, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset to advance the perception and autonomy of ground robots operating in diverse environments. This dataset, collected in various photorealistic simulation environments includes multiple RGB stereo cameras for 360-degree coverage, along with depth, optical flow, stereo disparity, LiDAR point clouds, ground truth poses, semantic segmented images, and occupancy maps with semantic labels. Data is collected using an integrated automatic pipeline, which generates trajectories mimicking the motion patterns of various ground robot platforms, including wheeled and legged robots. We collect 910 trajectories across 70 environments, resulting in 1.5 million samples. Evaluations on occupancy prediction and SLAM tasks reveal that state-of-the-art methods trained on existing datasets struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. TartanGround can serve as a testbed for training and evaluation of a broad range of learning-based tasks, including occupancy prediction, SLAM, neural scene representation, perception-based navigation, and more, enabling advancements in robotic perception and autonomy towards achieving robust models generalizable to more diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks, have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion (CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

Summary:
C2-Evo is introduced as an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework for enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through joint evolution of training data and model capabilities. This framework addresses core challenges faced by existing self-improving models, such as discrepancies in data complexity and mismatched difficulty levels between tasks and models. C2-Evo operates through two evolution loops: a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems combining structured textual sub-problems with geometric diagrams, while the latter adaptively selects and fine-tunes generated problems based on the model's performance. This iterative refinement process results in significant performance gains across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The code, models, and datasets associated with C2-Evo are set to be released, allowing for further research and implementation in the field of multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be released.

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers, enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation, and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

Summary:
BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention Prediction) is introduced as a zero-shot approach for pedestrian intention prediction in autonomous driving. It leverages short, continuous video clips with structured JAAD metadata to infer crossing intentions. Unlike GPT-4V methods that operate on discrete frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips and incorporates bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed through multimodal prompts. Despite not requiring additional training, BF-PIP achieves a 73% prediction accuracy, surpassing a GPT-4V baseline by 18%. This approach showcases the effectiveness of combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues in enhancing spatiotemporal perception and improving intent inference in ambiguous conditions. BF-PIP's performance highlights the potential for an agile, retraining-free perception module in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception module in intelligent transportation system.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature, the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a 5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental imaging.

Summary:
This study focuses on explaining how Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) integrate visual and language information to generate captions. Traditional metrics may not provide deep insights into this integration. The researchers propose a novel explanation framework based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs), combining symbolic rules with real-valued functions. The framework hypothesizes how relevant training examples influence caption generation. By learning a HMLN distribution over training instances and inferring shifts in distributions when conditioning on generated samples, the researchers can quantify the influence of specific examples on captions. Experiments with state-of-the-art captioning models and Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrate the interpretability of the explanations, enabling the comparison of models based on explainability. <div>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare these models along the dimension of explainability.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

Three different object detectors were compared using various patching configurations, with all models achieving a high accuracy of at least 93% mAP@IoU=0.5. Statistical analyses revealed insights into the impact of different factors on detection accuracy. Surprisingly, simpler and faster models performed just as well as more complex models, indicating the feasibility of using UAVs for this task. The study emphasizes the importance of computational efficiency in aerial wildlife tracking and provides datasets and models for further research on GitHub at https://github.com/chrisindris/Moose.

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment. Datasets and models will be made available via https://github.com/chrisindris/Moose.

<div> Latent Diffusion Model, HDR environment map estimation, ERP representation, environment map quality, Diffusion Transformer architecture 
Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach utilizing the Latent Diffusion Model for estimating HDR environment maps from a single-view image. The proposed method addresses common issues such as distortions at the poles and seam artefacts at the sides of the environment map by incorporating ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder. By introducing the panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer architecture, the researchers investigate the impact of adapting the diffusion network to the ERP format on the quality and accuracy of the estimated environment map. The PanoDiT network successfully reduces ERP distortions and artefacts, although there is a trade-off with image quality and plausibility. Evaluation using standard benchmarks indicates that the models produce high-quality environment maps that are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both image quality and lighting accuracy. <div>

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation, the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder. Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in both image quality and lighting accuracy.

<div> Keywords: CLIP-based models, chest X-ray classification, fairness, robustness, embeddings

Summary: 
CLIP-based models have shown strong performance in natural image-text domains, leading to their adaptation in medical tasks like chest X-ray classification. This study evaluates six CLIP-based models using three datasets and assesses their fairness and robustness. Performance gaps were observed between patients of different ages, but equitable results were seen across other attributes. Models exhibited lower performance on images without chest drains, indicating reliance on spurious correlations. Embeddings generated by the models could classify sensitive attributes, but PCA visualization did not show such patterns, highlighting visualization limitations. This study underscores the importance of evaluating fairness and robustness in medical AI models and provides insights into the performance and interpretability of CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally, we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new method for predicting 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real-time from a single 2D webcam feed. This method aims to enhance copresence and engagement in virtual 3D meetings by creating realistic and authentic 3D representations of individuals. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame independently, the reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from different viewpoints, ensuring authenticity. The introduction of a stability loss further improves the temporal stability of the reconstructions on video sequences. The method outperforms existing solutions in visual quality and stability metrics and allows for live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This approach democratizes volumetric communication, making 3D videoconferencing accessible, realistic, and authentic. <div>

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware, making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed, where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically, via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but also realistic and authentic.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework for accurate segmentation of tubular structures, particularly in medical imaging. The framework includes an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module that simultaneously learns global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps to target local discontinuity regions while maintaining global integrity. Additionally, a Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module refines the segmentation maps for improved accuracy. Experimental results on 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that GLCP outperforms existing methods in accuracy and continuity of tubular structure segmentation.

arXiv:2507.21328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically, we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively. This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at https://github.com/FeixiangZhou/GLCP.

Summary:
In this study, Visual Question Answering (VQA) is examined as a conversation between humans and AI systems, exploring the sensitivity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of Grice's cooperative principles. The researchers investigate how VLMs handle violations of Grice's maxims by introducing modifiers to questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset and analyzing the responses of three advanced VLMs: GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Flash. Their findings suggest that the performance of VLMs decreases consistently when modifiers are added, indicating a potential limitation in their understanding of complex conversational nuances. This approach offers insights into the capabilities and boundaries of VLMs in processing multimodal conversations, aligning with human cognitive processing of communication nuances. Further exploration of these limitations could enhance the development and refinement of VLMs for more effective and nuanced communication in the future. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort. Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality. However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans. Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18 subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it more suitable for real-time clinical applications.

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets (AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Collaborative Perceiver (CoP) is a new multi-task learning framework designed for vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection in autonomous driving. It focuses on incorporating spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to enhance environmental context understanding. The framework generates dense occupancy ground truths with local density information, utilizes voxel-height-guided sampling for fine-grained feature extraction, and implements a global-local collaborative feature fusion module for robust BEV representations. Experimental results on the nuScenes benchmark show that CoP outperforms existing frameworks with a 49.5% mAP and 59.2% NDS on the test set. By bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement, CoP offers a more comprehensive perception of the physical world in autonomous driving scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next, we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving 49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework (PDAF) for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) to address domain shifts in unseen environments. PDAF incorporates a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and enhance feature alignment. The framework consists of three modules: Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts LDP, Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations, and Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) estimates LDP without paired samples. This iterative process effectively models domain shifts, refining feature representations for improved generalization in complex target conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of PDAF in diverse urban scenes. <div>
arXiv:2507.21367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains. To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and challenging urban scenes.

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics. This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

Summary:
LLaVA-Reward is introduced as an efficient reward model for evaluating text-to-image generations using pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike existing approaches that require instruction-following data for fine-tuning, LLaVA-Reward directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs with text-image pairs, eliminating the need for time-consuming training. The incorporation of Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting visual features with hidden representations. LLaVA-Reward supports various types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired and unpaired data. Trained on four evaluation perspectives, it outperforms conventional methods in generating human-aligned scores and scaling in text-to-image generations. <div>

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

<div> Keywords: multimodal large language models, training efficiency, token pruning, reference-guided adaptive token elision, teacher-student framework

Summary: 
ReGATE is introduced as an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating the training of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It utilizes a teacher-student framework where a reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher and the MLLM being trained as the student. By combining per-token reference losses with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's difficulty scores, ReGATE selectively processes essential tokens during the forward pass, reducing computational overhead significantly. Experimental results show that applying ReGATE to VideoLLaMA2 achieves peak accuracy on MVBench up to twice as fast as standard training, using only 35% of the tokens. Moreover, with further training, ReGATE surpasses the baseline on various multimodal benchmarks while reducing the total token count by more than 41%. The code and models for ReGATE will be made available soon.

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous driving, Bird's-Eye View encoders, MapDiffusion, Uncertainty estimation, HD map construction <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces MapDiffusion, a novel approach for generating multiple plausible vectorized maps by leveraging the diffusion paradigm. Unlike traditional models that provide deterministic point estimates, MapDiffusion captures uncertainty and ambiguity in real-world environments. By iteratively refining randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, MapDiffusion generates multiple map samples, improving prediction accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that MapDiffusion outperforms baseline methods by 5% in single-sample performance. Aggregating multiple samples enhances performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. The uncertainty estimates produced by MapDiffusion are particularly useful in identifying ambiguous regions with occlusions. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the reliability and robustness of online HD map construction for autonomous vehicles, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making in complex environments. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments.

<div> Keywords: semi-supervised learning, medical image segmentation, dual cross-image semantic consistency, prototype representation, self-aware confidence estimation 

Summary:
The study introduces a new Dual Cross-Image Semantic Consistency (DuCiSC) learning framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. It addresses limitations of current approaches by focusing on region-level semantic consistency and balancing labeled and unlabeled data through dual paradigms. DuCiSC aligns prototypes to establish cross-image semantics and mitigate feature discrepancy issues. A self-aware confidence estimation strategy is also introduced to select reliable pseudo labels from unlabeled data for training. The effectiveness of DuCiSC is validated on various medical image segmentation datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The code for DuCiSC is publicly available for further research and development. <div>
arXiv:2507.21440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al \underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic \underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms, DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets, including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DuCiSC}{https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DuCiSC}.

<div> Keywords: Vision Language Navigation, Recursive Visual Imagination, Adaptive Linguistic Grounding, navigation policy, semantic matching

Summary:
Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) is proposed to summarize visual perceptions along navigation trajectories, focusing on semantic scene layouts. Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) aligns learned memories with linguistic components for accurate navigation anticipation. The navigation policy outperforms existing methods on VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of RVI and ALG techniques for Vision Language Navigation. The approach addresses challenges of overly detailed scene representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, enhancing linguistic grounding and improving navigational decision-making. By structurally modeling historical trajectories and purposefully aligning situational memories with language, the proposed techniques enable agents to better understand high-level scene priors and adhere to linguistic commands during navigation in unknown environments. <div>
arXiv:2507.21450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Summary:
- Dataset Distillation aims to reduce dataset size for training large deep models while maintaining performance.
- Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation focuses on distilling images and their self-supervised representations.
- Parameterization with low-dimensional bases and base selection are crucial for faithful preservation of dataset characteristics.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars, where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets, yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability. Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image, leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer learning performance.

<div> Keywords: 4D light field representation, angular feature modeling, object tracking, low-light scenes, geometric structure 

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel light field representation called the epipolar-plane structure image (ESI), which enhances visual expression in low-light scenes and reduces redundancy in high-dimensional light fields by capturing the geometric structure within the light field. An angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) is proposed for light field object tracking, learning angular-aware representations and optimizing in a self-supervised manner to improve geometric feature interaction across the temporal domain. A large-scale light field low-light dataset for object tracking is introduced. Experiments show that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking and is effective for multiple object tracking, demonstrating the importance of high-quality light field angular-temporal modeling. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain, particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field angular-temporal modeling.

Summary: 
DAC framework combines CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for open-set 3D object retrieval using only multi-view images. The MLLM describes seen category information for adaptation during training and provides external hints about unknown objects during inference. An Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA) improves synergy and generalization. DAC outperforms existing methods by an average of +10.01% mAP on four open-set 3DOR datasets. Generalization is confirmed on image-based and cross-dataset setups. The code for DAC is available on GitHub at https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/DAC. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set 3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images, DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/DAC.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

The paper introduces a model called Chain-of-Cooking for visualizing the cooking process, addressing challenges in generating images for each step of a recipe. The Dynamic Patch Selection Module retrieves relevant image patches for correct ingredient appearances, while the Semantic Evolution Module maintains coherence by associating latent prompts with the current step. The Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought Guidance ensures rational order by updating features based on previous steps. A dataset named CookViz is also introduced, containing image-text pairs for intermediate cooking process steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating coherent and semantically consistent cooking process visualizations. <div>
arXiv:2507.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

<div> deepfake detection, online synthesized forgeries, gradient conflicts, Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework, state-of-the-art performance

Summary:
The study addresses the issue of degraded performance in deepfake detection models when jointly training on original and online synthesized forgeries. Through empirical analysis, the researchers identify gradient conflicts during backpropagation as the cause of this degradation. To overcome this challenge, they propose the Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework, consisting of two modules: Update Vector Search (UVS) and Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR). The UVS module searches for an alternative update vector to reconcile disparities between data types, while the CGR module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. The synergy of UVS and CGR aims to alleviate gradient interference in parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization. <div>
arXiv:2507.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules. First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type. Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

<div> Sun sensor, spacecraft attitude, calibration algorithms, uncertainties, modeling techniques 

Summary: 
Sun sensors are crucial for determining spacecraft attitude, with calibration being a complex process due to various uncertainties. These uncertainties, spanning manufacturing, environmental, and interference sources, necessitate advanced calibration algorithms to reduce error and enhance accuracy over the sensor's lifecycle. Despite extensive research on modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors, there is a lack of a consolidated resource for this information. This review aims to systematically map out the existing algorithms for sun sensor modeling and calibration across different sensor configurations. By providing a comprehensive survey of each methodology, identifying research gaps, and suggesting future research directions, this review aims to enhance the understanding and application of sun sensor calibration in spacecraft technology. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these, sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.

<div> linear dependency analysis, network pruning, convolutional neural networks, resource-constrained platforms, performance preservation

Summary:
LinDeps is a novel post-pruning method that identifies and removes redundant filters in convolutional neural networks by utilizing linear dependency analysis. By applying pivoted QR decomposition to feature maps, LinDeps can detect and prune linearly dependent filters, leading to improved compression rates and performance preservation compared to existing pruning techniques. Additionally, a signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's kernels to maintain compatibility and performance without requiring any fine-tuning. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets using VGG and ResNet backbones demonstrate that LinDeps achieves state-of-the-art compression rates while preserving performance. Moreover, in low-resource setups where retraining is not possible, LinDeps shows significant improvements in pruning and inference speedups over existing methods. Overall, LinDeps offers a valuable enhancement for current and future pruning techniques in efficiently deploying convolutional neural networks on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer, resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps, a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

<div> hallucination, multimodal large language models, preference optimization, grounding, causally relevant visual information

Summary:
TARS introduces a token-adaptive preference strategy for multimodal large language models to reduce hallucinations in vision-language reasoning. By reformulating preference optimization as a min-max problem, TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts while minimizing expected preference loss to maintain causal grounding and mitigate overfitting. The approach simulates alignment uncertainty and reduces dependency on superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to improved model reliability. With only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS achieves a significant reduction in hallucination rates and cognition value, outperforming standard preference optimization methods and matching GPT-4o on key metrics. <div>
arXiv:2507.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting less influential branches.

  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions for future research.

<div> latent diffusion model, face aging, personalized aging, local aging signs, identity preservation

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach to face aging that overcomes the limitations of current methods by considering facial aging as a local, heterogeneous process. Unlike existing techniques that condition generation on a reference image and target age, this approach leverages latent diffusion models to selectively age specific facial regions based on local aging signs. By blending these locally aged regions seamlessly with a latent diffusion refiner, the method ensures a globally consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and enables a natural, controllable aging progression. This finer-grained control over the generation process allows for more personalized face aging simulations, enhancing the overall quality and realism of the generated aged faces. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process, enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging: robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a natural, controllable aging progression.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised tracking, spatio-temporal consistency, instance contrastive loss, benchmark datasets, generic tracking representations <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new self-supervised tracking framework, called \textbf{{\tracker}}, that aims to eliminate the need for manual box annotations in tracking datasets. The framework utilizes a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training approach to learn target information across timestamps effectively. It also incorporates an instance contrastive loss to learn instance-level correspondences from multiple perspectives, providing robust instance supervision without additional labels. By simulating appearance and motion variations in real-world scenarios, \textbf{{\tracker}} can learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, reducing the reliance on extensive box annotations. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that \textbf{{\tracker}} outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised tracking methods, achieving significant improvements in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, and TrackingNet datasets. The code for \textbf{{\tracker}} is available on GitHub for further exploration and utilization. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions, outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative medicine and related fields.

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades, accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting, turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Summary:
Industrial anomaly detection is crucial for manufacturing systems' safety and reliability. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), while strong in vision-language reasoning, lack effectiveness in this area without domain-specific adaptation. To address this gap, the EMIT framework is proposed, enhancing MLLMs with difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT uses GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images and integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings for few-shot anomaly detection. The difficulty-aware GRPO extends the original GRPO by including response resampling and advantage reweighting mechanisms to handle challenging data samples. Experimental results on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate EMIT's significant improvement in IAD performance, with an average increase of 7.77% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25 fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area. Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

Summary:
Adaptive Path Tracing (APT) addresses issues encountered in patch-based approaches for high-resolution image generation. The framework combines Statistical Matching to maintain consistency in patch distributions during the upsampling of latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to handle patch monotonicity. APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images, improving inference speed with minimal quality degradation through a shortcut denoising process. By tackling "patch-level distribution shift" and "increased patch monotonicity," APT enhances the quality and efficiency of high-resolution image generation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of APT, demonstrating its practicality for producing detailed outputs at faster sampling rates. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.21690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions, limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While training-based approaches address this limitation by training on high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently, training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches, which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

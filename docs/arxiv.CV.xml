Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

<br>
Summary:
Pre-training CLIP and DINO under controlled settings with the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration resulted in similar ImageNet accuracy. Analysis of embeddings showed that CLIP captures high-level semantics while DINO is more responsive to low-level features. When integrated into vision-language models and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excelled at text-intensive tasks while DINO performed slightly better on vision-centric tasks. Different variants of language supervision did not yield significant gains. This study provides insight into the design of vision encoders and their impact on vision-language model performance. <div>

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable, annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2, placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy while maintaining captioning quality.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages: First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and 91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets, respectively.

arXiv:2510.11996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter, occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial environments.

Summary: 
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown excellent performance in medical imaging tasks, but their complex attention mechanisms make it challenging to explain model decisions. This study compared different ViT architectures and pre-training strategies using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM on tasks like peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image classification. The research found that DINO combined with Grad-CAM provided the most faithful and localized explanations. Grad-CAM consistently produced precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout had more scattered activations. Even in misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlighted relevant morphological features.

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks: peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

Summary: 
The article presents a novel approach, APGNet, for detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments, addressing challenges of image degradation and natural camouflage. By incorporating the Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration algorithm for data augmentation, APGNet mitigates degradation effects. The use of an Extended Receptive Field module and Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder aids in capturing multi-scale contextual information and refining feature representations. Additionally, the adaptive prior-guided mechanism combines position and boundary priors to enhance detection accuracy. Experimental results on MAS datasets show that APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods in camouflaged object detection. <div>
arXiv:2510.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms. Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network, which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation, generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects. Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely used evaluation metrics.

Summary:
VidMP3 is a novel approach that addresses the challenges of motion-preserved video editing by leveraging pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion representation. Traditional diffusion-based editing methods focus on structure preservation, but VidMP3 goes beyond that by enabling structural and semantic flexibility while maintaining the original motion of source videos. This approach overcomes issues like temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for human intervention. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations have shown the superiority of VidMP3 over existing methods. The code for VidMP3 will be publicly available on GitHub, ensuring accessibility and further development in the field of motion-preserved video editing. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored. Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks, using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Summary:
Domain Adaptation is a crucial method in computer vision, particularly in image classification, where labeled data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. This paper explores various strategies to implement Domain Adaptation, focusing on using a model trained on one dataset to make predictions on data from a different but related domain. By leveraging the knowledge gained from the trained model, such as paintings of airplanes, to predict on real images of airplanes, researchers can address the challenges posed by limited labeled data. Domain Adaptation offers a solution to the high cost and difficulty of obtaining labeled data, allowing for the generation of reliable results comparable to established benchmark performances. Through implementing Domain Adaptation techniques, computer vision researchers can improve the efficiency and accuracy of image classification tasks, even in the face of data scarcity.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification, where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Summary: <br>
In this paper, a novel diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework is proposed for generating high-quality and controllable talking videos of arbitrary length. The approach addresses challenges faced by existing methods, including lip-sync accuracy, temporal coherence for long videos, and multi-character animation. The use of a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift inference approach enables efficient long video generation while preserving the capabilities of the model.

A training-free method, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), is introduced for multi-character animation, supporting audio-driven animation for three or more characters without the need for specialized datasets or model modifications. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character audio-driven video generation in a simple and cost-effective manner. <br> <div>

Summary:
The paper introduces a new approach for QR code deblurring, focusing on successful decoding rather than perceptual quality. The Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB) is proposed to incorporate explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture, leading to the development of the Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer) network for severely blurred QR codes and the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for mildly blurred inputs. These networks are integrated into the Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the appropriate network based on input blur severity, making it suitable for resource-constrained mobile devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve superior performance with competitive speed, positioning them as state-of-the-art solutions in QR code deblurring. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration. Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.

<div> geometry, 3D scene reconstruction, generative models, depth maps, scene completion

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel method that addresses limitations in existing 3D scene reconstruction techniques by leveraging accurate geometry guidance. By utilizing planar structures to derive metric-scale depth maps, the proposed method enhances visibility mask estimation, guides novel view selection, and improves multi-view consistency. This approach leads to high-quality reconstructions in both observed and unobserved regions, reducing shape-appearance ambiguities and enhancing scene geometry. The method outperforms existing techniques on datasets like Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending, showing superior performance in geometry and appearance reconstruction, especially for unobserved areas. Additionally, the method supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, demonstrating strong generalizability in various indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world applicability. Overall, the proposed method significantly advances 3D scene reconstruction by integrating accurate geometry as a fundamental component in leveraging generative models.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision, they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions, let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion. Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world applicability.

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.

<div> face restoration, old photos, diffusion-guided methods, self-supervised selective-guided diffusion, VintageFace benchmark

Summary:
The article introduces a new method, SSDiff, for restoring faces in old photos, addressing challenges such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. SSDiff leverages pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak guidance to enable region-specific restoration. The method incorporates face parsing maps and scratch masks for selective restoration of breakage regions while avoiding identity mismatch. It uses staged supervision for structural guidance and color refinement, aligning with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. The researchers also introduce VintageFace, a benchmark dataset of 300 real old face photos with varying degradation levels. SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. The code for SSDiff is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a 300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels. SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link: https://github.com/PRIS-CV/SSDiff.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation quality for authorized applications.

<div> Single-photon cameras, compressive histograms, optimization, coding functions, hardware constraints<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
Single-photon cameras are commonly used in time-of-flight 3D imaging due to their high resolution photon time-tagging capability. However, hardware limitations can affect their performance. Compressive histograms were introduced as a solution for data rate challenges, but they can struggle under real-world illumination constraints. A constrained optimization approach for designing coding functions for compressive single-photon 3D imaging is proposed in this study. By optimizing an illumination and coding matrix using gradient descent, the approach adheres to hardware constraints and outperforms traditional coding designs. This is particularly evident in systems constrained by peak power. The approach also handles arbitrary parameterized impulse responses well, as demonstrated in evaluation with a real-world system. <div>
arXiv:2510.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution. However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

<div> Keywords: Generalist visual captioning, CapFlow, Multi-agent collaboration, Data synthesis, MetaCaptioner

Summary: 
CapFlow is introduced as a new approach to generalist visual captioning, aiming to bridge the gap between open-source models and commercial ones. By leveraging the collaboration of multiple agents, CapFlow achieves caption quality comparable to GPT-4.1 while reducing costs by 89.5%. Through data synthesis, CapFlow generates high-quality visual captions across various domains, leading to the development of MetaCaptioner, a generalist visual captioner achieved through fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaCaptioner not only matches commercial models in captioning capabilities but also excels in multimodal performance within the open-source community. This innovative approach is expected to advance future multimodal research by providing a robust and cost-effective solution for visual captioning tasks.

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5% reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work. Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

Summary: <br><br>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to fine-tune models during the test phase for adapting to various unknown downstream domain distributions without pre-acquiring data. Existing CTTA methods struggle with forgetting historical knowledge, leading to insufficient learning of new information and performance degradation. To address this, the proposed Knowledge Fusion and Fission (KFF) method dynamically expands and merges class-aware domain knowledge in old and new domains. The Domain Knowledge Fission (KFI) module separates new knowledge from historical data, reducing negative impacts. The Domain Knowledge Fusion (KFU) module merges fissioned knowledge efficiently to improve compatibility and computational efficiency. Experimental results on the ImageNet-C dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against other methods. <div>

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end, existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool, alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed method against other methods.

Summary: 
Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL) is introduced as a framework for one-shot medical image segmentation, addressing challenges in prototype representation. DPL models prototypes as learnable probability distributions, allowing for the generation of diverse yet coherent variant sets from limited labeled data. The framework incorporates a diffusion-based prototype enhancement module, a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism, and a conservative fusion strategy to enhance prototype representation. Training and inference consistency is ensured through the use of the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline. Through extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets, DPL demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing new state-of-the-art results in one-shot medical image segmentation. DPL's diffusion process acts as a regularizer while generating enhanced prototypes for similarity calculations, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed framework. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization. This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics, and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

<div> pre-trained state space models, video classification, prompt learning, spatial contextual information, temporal contextual information <br>
Summary: <br>
The article introduces a new method called State Space Prompting (SSP) for video understanding. SSP combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in videos efficiently. It addresses the limitations of sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens in capturing spatial and temporal contextual information, enhancing the propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames. The proposed SSP method consists of an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module to aggregate spatial key information within each frame and an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. Through adaptive balancing and compression of key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 2.76% on four video benchmark datasets while reducing the parameter fine-tuning overhead. <br> <div>

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

<br>Summary: 
The paper introduces UniGS, a unified map representation and differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. The framework includes a CUDA-accelerated rasterization pipeline for rendering RGB images, depth maps, surface normals, and semantic logits simultaneously. It uses differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection for depth rendering, enhancing rotation and scale optimization through analytic depth gradients. The framework also provides an analytic gradient formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency in reconstructed 3D scenes. A learnable attribute is introduced for efficient pruning of Gaussians during training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show superior reconstruction accuracy in all modalities, validating the effectiveness of the geometry-aware paradigm.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images, geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers, enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Summary:
BEEP3D-Box is proposed for 3D instance segmentation with box-level annotations, using a student-teacher framework. The teacher model generates pseudo-masks updated by the student model via Exponential Moving Average. Instance center-based query refinement improves position query localization.

Competitive performance on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets is achieved while remaining computationally efficient. <div>
arXiv:2510.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage. However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining computationally efficient.

<div> knowledge distillation, visual perception, multimodal large language models, CompoDistill, compositional reasoning

Summary:
CompoDistill introduces a novel knowledge distillation framework aimed at improving the visual perception abilities of smaller models by aligning their visual attention with that of larger models, addressing the limitations of existing methods. Through systematic analysis, the misalignment of visual attention between teacher and student models was identified as a key challenge, which CompoDistill effectively tackles. The framework significantly enhances performance on compositional reasoning tasks reliant on visual perception while maintaining strong results on visual question answering tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CompoDistill, even with more advanced model architectures, demonstrating its generalizability. The framework's focus on aligning visual attention highlights its innovative approach to improving multimodal large language models through knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity, making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative, which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model (teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies, and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models (VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic events.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models. Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning, which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only, specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios. It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting, utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection models.

Summary: <br>
- Micro-expressions are brief facial movements that reveal genuine emotions and are crucial for applications in psychology and security.
- Recognizing micro-expressions is challenging due to their subtle and transient nature and limited annotated data availability.
- Conventional dynamic image-based methods for micro-expression recognition often overlook the distinct temporal phases within a micro-expression.
- The proposed DIANet framework leverages phase-aware dynamic images to capture the onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases separately and integrates features using a cross-attention fusion module.

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network, and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a promising direction for advancing MER.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c) scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes. For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse. Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

<div> Efficiency, image generation, multi-token prediction, self-correcting, quality improvement <br>
<br>
Efficiency in image and video generation is crucial, with a focus on reducing inference time and improving model size. A novel approach combines auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction to achieve up to a tenfold decrease in inference time. However, predicting multiple tokens in parallel can lead to structural inconsistencies due to complex joint dependencies. To address this issue, a method for self-correcting image generation is proposed, allowing for iterative refinement of sampled tokens. By injecting random tokens in the context during training, robustness is improved, and errors in predictions can be fixed during sampling. Evaluation on ImageNet-256, CIFAR-10, UCF-101, and NuScenes datasets shows significant improvements in image and video generation quality, maintaining the time-saving benefits of parallel token prediction. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step, reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements across both modalities.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling. Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at: https://github.com/nanjin1/Ivan-ISTD.

<div> Keywords: video representation, proxy nodes, spatio-temporal consistency, appearance editing, video processing<br>
Summary:<br>
The article proposes a novel approach to video representation using spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes. These nodes offer stable multi-scale structure representation of visual objects, resistant to tracking errors, motion, occlusion, and viewpoint changes. The dynamic update mechanism of the proxy nodes leverages spatio-temporal priors to handle scene and object changes effectively. Furthermore, the decoupled encoding of shape and texture representations enables fine-grained appearance editing across different visual objects in the video. Experimental results demonstrate high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters, supporting video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing tasks.<br> <div>
arXiv:2510.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability, this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand, the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing.

Summary:
The article introduces two new loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, designed for semantic segmentation in medical and cellular images. Traditional loss functions like Cross Entropy and Dice Loss may not perform optimally with limited data in medical imaging due to data scarcity. The Multiplicative Loss combines these two losses multiplicatively, adjusting gradients based on prediction confidence to stabilize optimization. The Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss further enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by scaling gradients based on confidence levels and predicted probabilities. Experimental results on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms existing loss functions, providing a simple and effective solution for robust segmentation in challenging data environments without the need for hyperparameter tuning. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used, their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples. This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel OOD detection method for neural networks to address the challenge of overconfident predictions on OOD data. It leverages local background features from ID images to simulate OOD representations during training. By optimizing to reduce the $L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks can mitigate the overconfidence issue when faced with OOD data. The method proves effective in multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks, showcasing improved performance compared to existing methods. It demonstrates compatibility with post-hoc techniques and achieves new state-of-the-art results in OOD detection. The approach offers a cost-effective solution without the need for auxiliary OOD datasets or generated fake OOD images. <div>
arXiv:2510.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the $L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods, with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Summary:<br>
Visible-infrared image fusion is essential for applications like autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Existing unsupervised methods face challenges due to limitations in manual loss functions. To address this, a new approach called AngularFuse is proposed. It includes a cross-modal mask module for learning complementary information, a strategy for generating detailed and balanced reference images, and an angle-aware loss for preserving texture intensity and edge orientation. Experiments on public datasets show AngularFuse outperforms existing methods, producing sharper and more detailed fusion results in challenging scenes. <div>

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images, covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format. SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications. SpineBench is publicly available at https://zhangchenghanyu.github.io/SpineBench.github.io/.

Summary:
Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS) addresses the trade-off between fidelity and computational cost in reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes for autonomous driving. PAGS introduces Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization to simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving details on safety-critical objects.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost. This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects, while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), where untrimmed videos with complex background content need to be retrieved based on a given query. They propose a novel framework called DL-DKD++ which utilizes a dual learning approach with dynamic knowledge distillation. The framework consists of a large teacher model that supervises a compact student network with two branches: an inheritance branch for transferable knowledge and an exploration branch for task-specific information. By incorporating a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism, the model can capture fine-grained partial relevance between videos and queries better. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on various datasets for PRVR. The code for the model is also made available for further research and implementation. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content. However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve during training, our method enables the model to better capture the fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/DL-DKD.

Summary: <br>
This paper examines logo hallucination in Vision Language Models (VLMs) where models generate text despite logos lacking visible words. The study uses curated logo splits and perturbations to measure hallucinations, finding they persist even under strong distortions. Analysis shows hallucination is tied to specific projector dimensions, with targeted ablation reducing errors while maintaining OCR accuracy. VLMs rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, especially for circular logos. The study highlights the importance of disentangling projector subspaces and using OCR-guided decoding to build more reliable multimodal systems. <div>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode. Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

The challenge involves generating renders of urban environments from different viewpoints using car-centric frames as training data. Their solution combines 3D reconstruction with a diffusion model to enhance the generated frames. Specific choices were made in the initialization of gaussian primitives and the training data curation for the enhancer model.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place overall.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces CurriFlow, a framework for semantic scene completion from monocular images in autonomous driving applications. CurriFlow integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion to improve motion reasoning and handle occlusions. It utilizes a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames, enhancing temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. The framework employs curriculum learning to transition from sparse but accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring geometric robustness. Semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision for improved semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, showcasing its effectiveness for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion. <div>

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion. CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Summary: 
- A novel learnable subsampling framework is proposed for deep neural networks to reduce computational complexity in tasks like 3D volume or video classification.
- Existing methods using the Gumbel-max trick for non-differentiable operations are limited in adaptability, as they are task-adaptive rather than input-adaptive.
- The proposed attention-guided sampling module dynamically adjusts to input data during inference, leading to improved performance and reduced complexity.
- The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D and two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks.
- One of the ultrasound video datasets is a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical conditions. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance, these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks, not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive. Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical conditions.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces STORM-PSR, a dual-stream framework for Procedure Step Recognition (PSR) that combines spatial and temporal features. The spatial stream detects assembly object states in unobstructed views, while the spatio-temporal stream recognizes step completions even under partial occlusion. STORM-PSR utilizes a spatial encoder pretrained with a weakly supervised approach and a transformer-based temporal encoder to capture spatial and temporal relationships. Evaluation on MECCANO and IndustReal datasets shows a significant reduction in delay between actual and predicted step completions compared to prior methods. This reduction is attributed to the spatio-temporal stream's ability to infer step completions without relying on unobstructed views. The code for STORM-PSR and newly annotated MECCANO labels are publicly available for further research. <br> <div>

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object, while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%, respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

<div> Scene coordinate regression, implicit scene representations, probabilistic reinterpretation, reconstruction priors, 3D point cloud diffusion model <br>
Summary: 
Scene coordinate regression models are effective for 3D vision tasks but may degenerate if training images lack multi-view constraints. A probabilistic reinterpretation with high-level reconstruction priors, including depth value distribution and learned scene coordinate configurations, enhances the learning process. By training a diffusion model on indoor scans, predicted 3D points are guided towards realistic geometry, improving scene representations, point cloud coherence, registration rates, camera poses, and performance in tasks like view synthesis and camera relocalization. <div>
arXiv:2510.12387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models, which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations, resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs, vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation. This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021 and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3) What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel framework called conditional flow matching (CFM) for image quality transfer, specifically focusing on low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI). CFM learns a continuous flow between noise and target data distributions by directly regressing an optimal velocity field, which allows for reconstruction of high-quality MR images from low-field inputs. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and generalizes well to various data types, including out-of-distribution data. It achieves this while using fewer parameters compared to other deep learning methods, making it a promising tool for MRI reconstruction in resource-limited clinical settings. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods. These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Summary:<br><br>Agent-based systems using large language models for long video understanding face challenges in capturing temporal context and discarding crucial information due to sparse frame sampling. To address these issues, VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework, is proposed. Inspired by human recollection, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity to systematically mine deep memories for answering questions in long videos. By iterating through the memory levels, VideoLucy effectively captures temporal context while preserving critical details. Additionally, a new benchmark, EgoMem, is introduced for evaluating models' ability to understand complex events over time in long videos. Extensive experiments show VideoLucy outperforming state-of-the-art methods, even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4o. The code and dataset for VideoLucy will be publicly available at https://videolucy.github.io. <div>
arXiv:2510.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding. EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks, achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at https://videolucy.github.io

Summary:
This article discusses the use of vision language models for automating Chest Xray radiology report generation to reduce manual workload. It highlights the importance of incorporating longitudinal data for more accurate comparison statements in report generation. The survey examines dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures tailored for longitudinal settings, and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches, however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements. Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Summary:
MS-GAGA is a two-stage framework for crafting imperceptible and transferable adversarial examples targeted at deepfake detectors in black-box scenarios. In Stage 1, the dual-stream attack module uses MNTD-PGD to optimize gradient calculations for small perturbations and SG-PGD to focus perturbations on visually salient regions, expanding the search space for adversarial examples. In Stage 2, the metric-aware selection module evaluates candidates based on their success against black-box models and structural similarity to the original image, achieving up to 27% higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to existing attacks. By jointly optimizing for transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA demonstrates improved performance in circumventing deepfake detectors.

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage 1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27% higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data, especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation. However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions. Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority over the state of the arts.

<title>Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion for Computing Unsigned Distance Fields from Unoriented Points</title>

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD), for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF. Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces, as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining computationally efficient and stable.

<title>Unconditional Human Motion and Shape Generation via Balanced Score-Based Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2 score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in isolation.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning (IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

<title>MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565</link>

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability. Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii) Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and (iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at https://github.com/Annzstbl/MMOT.

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural scenarios.

<title>LayerSync: Self-aligning Intermediate Layers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient, plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75 number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step, significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or diffusion models.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information, enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text. Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR), which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase of over 5 times compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges, including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset, WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless, existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically, image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE). State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large, non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27 hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models. Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight alternatives.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission. Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model weights will be released under a permissive license.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations: bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL) using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals, enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/ERELIFM.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization. While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally, it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS, an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare. However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients' privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals, clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity, and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis. Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

<title>E-MoFlow: Learning Egomotion and Optical Flow from Event Data via Implicit Regularization</title>

arXiv:2510.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in 3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision (e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even with supervised approaches.

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention (DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data. DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG, 18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5 plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The code is available at https://github.com/maxxxxxxcai/DL-HMC-TMI.

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training. Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

<title>Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation, vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation. Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT. Code and models are publicly available at https://compvis.github.io/flow-poke-transformer.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts. This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward} ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a \textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82 to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation via self-rewarding.

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film, virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming, requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here, we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model, MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to 360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Abstract: This paper reviews the AIM 2025 Efficient Real-World Deblurring using Single Images Challenge, which aims to advance in efficient real-blur restoration. The challenge is based on a new test set based on the well known RSBlur dataset. Pairs of blur and degraded images in this dataset are captured using a double-camera system. Participant were tasked with developing solutions to effectively deblur these type of images while fulfilling strict efficiency constraints: fewer than 5 million model parameters and a computational budget under 200 GMACs. A total of 71 participants registered, with 4 teams finally submitting valid solutions. The top-performing approach achieved a PSNR of 31.1298 dB, showcasing the potential of efficient methods in this domain. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenge, compares the proposed solutions, and serves as a valuable reference for researchers in efficient real-world image deblurring.

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text. This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI), which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs. In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch. Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes. Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured image analysis.

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic and ever-changing real-world information in order to address information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1, the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools. Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

Abstract: We introduce SeeingSounds, a lightweight and modular framework for audio-to-image generation that leverages the interplay between audio, language, and vision-without requiring any paired audio-visual data or training on visual generative models. Rather than treating audio as a substitute for text or relying solely on audio-to-text mappings, our method performs dual alignment: audio is projected into a semantic language space via a frozen language encoder, and, contextually grounded into the visual domain using a vision-language model. This approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience, reflects the natural cross-modal associations observed in human perception. The model operates on frozen diffusion backbones and trains only lightweight adapters, enabling efficient and scalable learning. Moreover, it supports fine-grained and interpretable control through procedural text prompt generation, where audio transformations (e.g., volume or pitch shifts) translate into descriptive prompts (e.g., "a distant thunder") that guide visual outputs. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks confirm that SeeingSounds outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised settings, establishing a new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual generation.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation aims to enable agents to autonomously navigate to sound sources in unknown 3D environments using auditory cues. While current AVN methods excel on in-distribution sound sources, they exhibit poor cross-source generalization: navigation success rates plummet and search paths become excessively long when agents encounter unheard sounds or unseen environments. This limitation stems from the lack of explicit alignment mechanisms between auditory signals and corresponding visual regions. Policies tend to memorize spurious \enquote{acoustic fingerprint-scenario} correlations during training, leading to blind exploration when exposed to novel sound sources. To address this, we propose the AGVP framework, which transforms sound from policy-memorable acoustic fingerprint cues into spatial guidance. The framework first extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, then uses this context as queries to guide visual feature attention, highlighting sound-source-related regions at the feature level. Subsequent temporal modeling and policy optimization are then performed. This design, centered on interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting, reduces dependency on specific acoustic fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate that AGVP improves both navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds.

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce \our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual \textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{} facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow. Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy. This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process. Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion acceleration.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks.

<title>Gaussian Semantic Field for One-shot LiDAR Global Localization</title>

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods, landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF (Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision. MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.

<title>Tensor Completion via Monotone Inclusion: Generalized Low-Rank Priors Meet Deep Denoisers</title>

Abstract: Missing entries in multi dimensional data pose significant challenges for downstream analysis across diverse real world applications. These data are naturally modeled as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex optimization. Building on the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low sampling rates.

<title>A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima</title>

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation), calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Abstract: We present a fast and effective policy framework for robotic manipulation, named Energy Policy, designed for high-frequency robotic tasks and resource-constrained systems. Unlike existing robotic policies, Energy Policy natively predicts multimodal actions in a single forward pass, enabling high-precision manipulation at high speed. The framework is built upon two core components. First, we adopt the energy score as the learning objective to facilitate multimodal action modeling. Second, we introduce an energy MLP to implement the proposed objective while keeping the architecture simple and efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated environments and real-world robotic tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of Energy Policy. The results show that Energy Policy matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art manipulation methods while significantly reducing computational overhead. Notably, on the MimicGen benchmark, Energy Policy achieves superior performance with at a faster inference compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category. In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images. In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM) from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective, we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable, efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such detailed captions.

Abstract: Incorporating heterogeneous representations from different architectures has facilitated various vision tasks, e.g., some hybrid networks combine transformers and convolutions. However, complementarity between such heterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised learning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection. The codes are available at https://github.com/NK-JittorCV/Self-Supervised/.

Abstract: Early wildfire detection (EWD) is of the utmost importance to enable rapid response efforts, and thus minimize the negative impacts of wildfire spreads.
  To this end, we present PYRONEAR-2025, a new dataset composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models. The data is sourced from: (i) web-scraped videos of wildfires from public networks of cameras for wildfire detection in-the-wild, (ii) videos from our in-house network of cameras, and (iii) a small portion of synthetic and real images.
  This dataset includes around 150,000 manual annotations on 50,000 images, covering 640 wildfires, PYRONEAR-2025 surpasses existing datasets in size and diversity. It includes data from France, Spain, Chile and the United States. Finally, it is composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models.
  We ran cross-dataset experiments using a lightweight state-of-the-art object detection model, as the ones used in-real-life, and found out the proposed dataset is particularly challenging, with F1 score of around 70\%, but more stable than existing datasets. Finally, its use in concordance with other public datasets helps to reach higher results overall.
  Last but not least, the video part of the dataset can be used to train a lightweight sequential model, improving global recall while maintaining precision for earlier detections.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.

Abstract: Visual abstract reasoning is core to image processing. We present Valen, a unified probability-highlighting baseline that excels on both RPM (progression) and Bongard-Logo (clustering) tasks. Analysing its internals, we find solvers implicitly treat each task as a distribution where primary samples fit and auxiliaries do not; hence the learning target is jointly shaped by both sets, not by correct solutions alone. To close the gap we first introduce Tine, an adversarial adapter that nudges Valen toward correct-solution density, but adversarial training is unstable. We therefore replace it with Funny, a fast Gaussian-mixture model that directly estimates the correct-solution density without adversarial games, and extend the same paradigm to SBR for progressive-pattern planning. Extensive experiments show explicit distribution planning is the key to stronger, interpretable abstract reasoning.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks compromise the training phase of federated learning (FL) such that the learned global model misclassifies attacker-chosen inputs called target inputs. Existing defenses mainly focus on protecting the training phase of FL such that the learnt global model is poison free. However, these defenses often achieve limited effectiveness when the clients' local training data is highly non-iid or the number of malicious clients is large, as confirmed in our experiments. In this work, we propose FLForensics, the first poison-forensics method for FL. FLForensics complements existing training-phase defenses. In particular, when training-phase defenses fail and a poisoned global model is deployed, FLForensics aims to trace back the malicious clients that performed the poisoning attack after a misclassified target input is identified. We theoretically show that FLForensics can accurately distinguish between benign and malicious clients under a formal definition of poisoning attack. Moreover, we empirically show the effectiveness of FLForensics at tracing back both existing and adaptive poisoning attacks on five benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Depression is characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest, significantly impairing daily functioning and now a widespread mental disorder. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective assessments, necessitating objective approaches for accurate diagnosis. Our study investigates the use of facial action units (AUs) and emotions as biomarkers for depression. We analyzed facial expressions from video data of participants classified with or without depression. Our methodology involved detailed feature extraction, mean intensity comparisons of key AUs, and the application of time series classification models. Furthermore, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and various clustering algorithms to explore the variability in emotional expression patterns. Results indicate significant differences in the intensities of AUs associated with sadness and happiness between the groups, highlighting the potential of facial analysis in depression assessment.

Abstract: Autonomous driving, particularly navigating complex and unanticipated scenarios, demands sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our model in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous driving. This dataset establishes a framework for robust, interpretable, and data-driven autonomous driving systems by providing a comprehensive platform for training and evaluating VLA models, contributing to safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles. The dataset is released for academic purpose.

<title>TreeDiffusion: Hierarchical Generative Clustering for Conditional Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Generative modeling and clustering are conventionally distinct tasks in machine learning. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely explored for their ability to integrate both, providing a framework for generative clustering. However, while VAEs can learn meaningful cluster representations in latent space, they often struggle to generate high-quality samples. This paper addresses this problem by introducing TreeDiffusion, a deep generative model that conditions diffusion models on learned latent hierarchical cluster representations from a VAE to obtain high-quality, cluster-specific generations. Our approach consists of two steps: first, a VAE-based clustering model learns a hierarchical latent representation of the data. Second, a cluster-aware diffusion model generates realistic images conditioned on the learned hierarchical structure. We systematically compare the generative capabilities of our approach with those of alternative conditioning strategies. Empirically, we demonstrate that conditioning diffusion models on hierarchical cluster representations improves the generative performance on real-world datasets compared to other approaches. Moreover, a key strength of our method lies in its ability to generate images that are both representative and specific to each cluster, enabling more detailed visualization of the learned latent structure. Our approach addresses the generative limitations of VAE-based clustering approaches by leveraging their learned structure, thereby advancing the field of generative clustering.

Abstract: Photography during night or in dark conditions typically suffers from noise, low light and blurring issues due to the dim environment and the common use of long exposure. Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are related under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve these tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

Abstract: The rise of the generative models quality during the past years enabled the generation of edited variations of images at an important scale. To counter the harmful effects of such technology, the Image Difference Captioning (IDC) task aims to describe the differences between two images. While this task is successfully handled for simple 3D rendered images, it struggles on real-world images. The reason is twofold: the training data-scarcity, and the difficulty to capture fine-grained differences between complex images. To address those issues, we propose in this paper a simple yet effective framework to both adapt existing image captioning models to the IDC task and augment IDC datasets. We introduce BLIP2IDC, an adaptation of BLIP2 to the IDC task at low computational cost, and show it outperforms two-streams approaches by a significant margin on real-world IDC datasets. We also propose to use synthetic augmentation to improve the performance of IDC models in an agnostic fashion. We show that our synthetic augmentation strategy provides high quality data, leading to a challenging new dataset well-suited for IDC named Syned1.

Abstract: Transductive zero-shot learning with vision-language models leverages image-image similarities within the dataset to achieve better classification accuracy compared to the inductive setting. However, there is little work that explores the structure of the language space in this context. We propose GTA-CLIP, a novel technique that incorporates supervision from language models for joint transduction in language and vision spaces. Our approach is iterative and consists of three steps: (i) incrementally exploring the attribute space by querying language models, (ii) an attribute-augmented transductive inference procedure, and (iii) fine-tuning the language and vision encoders based on inferred labels within the dataset. Through experiments with CLIP encoders, we demonstrate that GTA-CLIP, yields an average performance improvement of 8.6% and 3.7% across 12 datasets and 3 encoders, over CLIP and transductive CLIP respectively in the zero-shot setting. We also observe similar improvements in a few-shot setting. We present ablation studies that demonstrate the value of each step and visualize how the vision and language spaces evolve over iterations driven by the transductive learning. Code is released at https://github.com/cvl-umass/GTA-CLIP

Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals found in products like non-stick cookware, are unfortunately persistent environmental pollutants with severe health risks. Accurately mapping PFAS contamination is crucial for guiding targeted remediation efforts and protecting public and environmental health, yet detection across large regions remains challenging due to the cost of testing and the difficulty of simulating their spread. In this work, we introduce FOCUS, a geospatial deep learning framework with a label noise-aware loss function, to predict PFAS contamination in surface water over large regions. By integrating hydrological flow data, land cover information, and proximity to known PFAS sources, our approach leverages both spatial and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive ablation studies, robustness analysis, real-world validation, and comparative analyses against baselines like sparse segmentation, as well as existing scientific methods, including Kriging and pollutant transport simulations. Results and expert feedback highlight our framework's potential for scalable PFAS monitoring.

Abstract: It remains a significant challenge to compress images at extremely low bitrate while achieving both semantic consistency and high perceptual quality. Inspired by human progressive perception mechanism, we propose a Semantically Disentangled Image Compression framework (SEDIC) in this paper. Initially, an extremely compressed reference image is obtained through a learned image encoder. Then we leverage LMMs to extract essential semantic components, including overall descriptions, object detailed description, and semantic segmentation masks. We propose a training-free Object Restoration model with Attention Guidance (ORAG) built on pre-trained ControlNet to restore object details conditioned by object-level text descriptions and semantic masks. Based on the proposed ORAG, we design a multistage semantic image decoder to progressively restore the details object by object, starting from the extremely compressed reference image, ultimately generating high-quality and high-fidelity reconstructions. Experimental results demonstrate that SEDIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency at extremely low-bitrates ($\le$ 0.05 bpp).

Abstract: Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has become increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright infringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. In scalable applications, fine-tuning-based methods are time-consuming to precisely erase multiple target concepts, while real-time editing-based methods often degrade the generation quality of non-target concepts due to conflicting optimization objectives. To address this dilemma, we introduce SPEED, an efficient concept erasure approach that directly edits model parameters. SPEED searches for a null space, a model editing space where parameter updates do not affect non-target concepts, to achieve scalable and precise erasure. To facilitate accurate null space optimization, we incorporate three complementary strategies: Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to selectively retain the most affected non-target concepts, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to enrich the filtered retain set with semantically consistent variations, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to preserve key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in non-target preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully erasing 100 concepts within only 5 seconds. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/Ouxiang-Li/SPEED.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 18 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding has been transformed by open-vocabulary language models that enable interaction via natural language. However, at present the evaluation of these representations is limited to datasets with closed-set semantics that do not capture the richness of language. This work presents OpenLex3D, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating 3D open-vocabulary scene representations. OpenLex3D provides entirely new label annotations for scenes from Replica, ScanNet++, and HM3D, which capture real-world linguistic variability by introducing synonymical object categories and additional nuanced descriptions. Our label sets provide 13 times more labels per scene than the original datasets. By introducing an open-set 3D semantic segmentation task and an object retrieval task, we evaluate various existing 3D open-vocabulary methods on OpenLex3D, showcasing failure cases, and avenues for improvement. Our experiments provide insights on feature precision, segmentation, and downstream capabilities. The benchmark is publicly available at: https://openlex3d.github.io/.

Abstract: The practical application of AI tools for specific computer vision tasks relies on the "small-data regime" of hundreds to thousands of labeled samples. This small-data regime is vital for applications requiring expensive expert annotations, such as ecological monitoring, medical diagnostics or industrial quality control. We find, however, that computer vision research has ignored the small data regime as evaluations increasingly focus on zero- and few-shot learning. We use the Natural World Tasks (NeWT) benchmark to compare multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and vision-only methods across varying training set sizes. MLLMs exhibit early performance plateaus, while vision-only methods improve throughout the small-data regime, with performance gaps widening beyond 10 training examples. We provide the first comprehensive comparison between these approaches in small-data contexts and advocate for explicit small-data evaluations in AI research to better bridge theoretical advances with practical deployments.

Abstract: Effective scene representation is critical for the visual grounding ability of representations, yet existing methods for 3D Visual Grounding are often constrained. They either only focus on geometric and visual cues, or, like traditional 3D scene graphs, lack the multi-dimensional attributes needed for complex reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) framework, a novel scene representation framework that enriches robust geometric models with a spectrum of VLM-derived semantics, including appearance, physical properties, and affordances. The DSM is first constructed online by fusing multi-view observations within a temporal sliding window, creating a persistent and comprehensive world model. Building on this foundation, we propose DSM-Grounding, a new paradigm that shifts grounding from free-form VLM queries to a structured reasoning process over the semantic-rich map, markedly improving accuracy and interpretability. Extensive evaluations validate our approach's superiority. On the ScanRefer benchmark, DSM-Grounding achieves a state-of-the-art 59.06% overall accuracy of IoU@0.5, surpassing others by 10%. In semantic segmentation, our DSM attains a 67.93% F-mIoU, outperforming all baselines, including privileged ones. Furthermore, successful deployment on physical robots for complex navigation and grasping tasks confirms the framework's practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery demands precise spatial boundaries and robust intra-class consistency, challenging conventional hierarchical models. To address limitations arising from spatial domain feature fusion and insufficient receptive fields, this paper introduces SAIP-Net, a novel frequency-aware segmentation framework that leverages Spectral Adaptive Information Propagation. SAIP-Net employs adaptive frequency filtering and multi-scale receptive field enhancement to effectively suppress intra-class feature inconsistencies and sharpen boundary lines. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of spectral-adaptive strategies combined with expanded receptive fields for remote sensing image segmentation.

Abstract: Affordances are the potential actions an agent can perform on an object, as observed by a camera. Visual affordance prediction is formulated differently for tasks such as grasping detection, affordance classification, affordance segmentation, and hand pose estimation. This diversity in formulations leads to inconsistent definitions that prevent fair comparisons between methods. In this paper, we propose a unified formulation of visual affordance prediction by accounting for the complete information on the objects of interest and the interaction of the agent with the objects to accomplish a task. This unified formulation allows us to comprehensively and systematically review disparate visual affordance works, highlighting strengths and limitations of both methods and datasets. We also discuss reproducibility issues, such as the unavailability of methods implementation and experimental setups details, making benchmarks for visual affordance prediction unfair and unreliable. To favour transparency, we introduce the Affordance Sheet, a document that details the solution, datasets, and validation of a method, supporting future reproducibility and fairness in the community.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has become the dominant approach for medical image segmentation, yet ensuring the reliability and clinical applicability of these models requires addressing key challenges such as annotation variability, calibration, and uncertainty estimation. This is why we created the Calibration and Uncertainty for multiRater Volume Assessment in multiorgan Segmentation (CURVAS), which highlights the critical role of multiple annotators in establishing a more comprehensive ground truth, emphasizing that segmentation is inherently subjective and that leveraging inter-annotator variability is essential for robust model evaluation. Seven teams participated in the challenge, submitting a variety of DL models evaluated using metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). By incorporating consensus and dissensus ground truth, we assess how DL models handle uncertainty and whether their confidence estimates align with true segmentation performance. Our findings reinforce the importance of well-calibrated models, as better calibration is strongly correlated with the quality of the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that segmentation models trained on diverse datasets and enriched with pre-trained knowledge exhibit greater robustness, particularly in cases deviating from standard anatomical structures. Notably, the best-performing models achieved high DSC and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This work underscores the need for multi-annotator ground truth, thorough calibration assessments, and uncertainty-aware evaluations to develop trustworthy and clinically reliable DL-based medical image segmentation models.

<title>VideoRFT: Incentivizing Video Reasoning Capability in MLLMs via Reinforced Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To fill this gap, we propose VideoRFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VideoRFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a multi-expert-driven, cognition-inspired CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognition-inspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a MLLM conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets, i.e.VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VideoRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Worldwide image geolocalization-the task of predicting GPS coordinates from images taken anywhere on Earth-poses a fundamental challenge due to the vast diversity in visual content across regions. While recent approaches adopt a two-stage pipeline of retrieving candidates and selecting the best match, they typically rely on simplistic similarity heuristics and point-wise supervision, failing to model spatial relationships among candidates. In this paper, we propose GeoRanker, a distance-aware ranking framework that leverages large vision-language models to jointly encode query-candidate interactions and predict geographic proximity. In addition, we introduce a multi-order distance loss that ranks both absolute and relative distances, enabling the model to reason over structured spatial relationships. To support this, we curate GeoRanking, the first dataset explicitly designed for geographic ranking tasks with multimodal candidate information. GeoRanker achieves state-of-the-art results on two well-established benchmarks (IM2GPS3K and YFCC4K), significantly outperforming current best methods.

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

Abstract: Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world. Project page: https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/EmbodiedIQA

Abstract: We propose AdapTok, an adaptive temporal causal video tokenizer that can flexibly allocate tokens for different frames based on video content. AdapTok is equipped with a block-wise masking strategy that randomly drops tail tokens of each block during training, and a block causal scorer to predict the reconstruction quality of video frames using different numbers of tokens. During inference, an adaptive token allocation strategy based on integer linear programming is further proposed to adjust token usage given predicted scores. Such design allows for sample-wise, content-aware, and temporally dynamic token allocation under a controllable overall budget. Extensive experiments for video reconstruction and generation on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without additional image data, AdapTok consistently improves reconstruction quality and generation performance under different token budgets, allowing for more scalable and token-efficient generative video modeling.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for enhancing vision-language navigation (VLN) performance, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches predominantly adopt straightforward input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose EvolveNav, a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning paradigm that realizes adaptable and generalizable navigational reasoning for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation. Specifically, EvolveNav involves a two-stage training process: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with curated formalized CoT labels to first activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities, and simultaneously increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also designed to encourage the model to learn correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results under both task-specific and cross-task training paradigms demonstrate the consistent superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches on various popular benchmarks, including R2R, REVERIE, CVDN, and SOON. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.

<title>Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision</title>

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer, their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&amp;E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available. Our project page is: https://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/

Abstract: Agricultural parcels serve as basic units for conducting agricultural practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration, food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution images with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask labels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing datasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1) terrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple domain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks, including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction, and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level metrics. GTPBD fills a critical gap in terraced remote sensing research, providing a basic infrastructure for fine-grained agricultural terrain analysis and cross-scenario knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering verbatim training data replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. We challenge this assumption and demonstrate that, even after such pruning, small perturbations to the text embeddings of previously mitigated prompts can re-trigger data replication, revealing the fragility of such defenses. Our further analysis then provides multiple indications that memorization is indeed not inherently local: (1) replication triggers for memorized images are distributed throughout text embedding space; (2) embeddings yielding the same replicated image produce divergent model activations; and (3) different pruning methods identify inconsistent sets of memorization-related weights for the same image. Finally, we show that bypassing the locality assumption enables more robust mitigation through adversarial fine-tuning. These findings provide new insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and inform the development of more reliable mitigations against DM memorization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems. While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL) for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning. Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments. Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated videos and comparison results are in our project page.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies. Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2) feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset. Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data.

Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation. Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models, which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data, The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations, we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process low-level visual features is critical for evaluating their perceptual abilities and has not been systematically characterized. Inspired by human psychophysics, we introduce a behavioural method for estimating the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) in MLLMs by treating them as end-to-end observers. Models are queried with structured prompts while viewing noise-based stimuli filtered at specific spatial frequencies. Psychometric functions are derived from the binary verbal responses, and contrast thresholds (and CSFs) are obtained without relying on internal activations or classifier-based proxies. Our results reveal that some models resemble human CSFs in shape or scale, but none capture both. We also find that CSF estimates are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, indicating limited linguistic robustness. Finally, we show that CSFs predict model performance under frequency-filtered and adversarial conditions. These findings highlight systematic differences in frequency tuning across MLLMs and establish CSF estimation as a scalable diagnostic tool for multimodal perception.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alternative to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision, Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA) model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features. Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs), cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) relies on deep neural networks trained with large-scale labeled datasets. However, creating such datasets is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability of perception systems. Sim2Real learning offers a scalable alternative, but its success depends on the simulation's fidelity to real-world environments, dynamics, and sensors. This tutorial introduces a reproducible workflow for building high-fidelity digital twins (HiFi DTs) to generate realistic synthetic datasets. We outline practical steps for modeling static geometry, road infrastructure, and dynamic traffic using open-source resources such as satellite imagery, OpenStreetMap, and sensor specifications. The resulting environments support scalable and cost-effective data generation for robust Sim2Real learning. Using this workflow, we have released three synthetic LiDAR datasets, namely UT-LUMPI, UT-V2X-Real, and UT-TUMTraf-I, which closely replicate real locations and outperform real-data-trained baselines in perception tasks. This guide enables broader adoption of HiFi DTs in ITS research and deployment.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos. EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings. Project page: https://taiyi98.github.io/projects/EgoGazeVQA

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse. Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Rss1124/StegOT.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation has been widely studied in medical image segmentation as a tool to provide reliability, particularly in deep learning approaches. However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity, especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long); and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation. With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains 20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal quality loss.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal human motion generation.

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability. Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding.

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for 3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the 3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective, framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates, to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU memory to process thousands of images.

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process of changing magnification and moving between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods, offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and reduced reliance on expert operators.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems, guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management. Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

Abstract: In Mathematical Morphology for grey-level functions, an image is analysed by another image named the structuring function. This structuring function is translated over the image domain and summed to the image. However, in an image presenting lighting variations, the amplitude of the structuring function should vary according to the image intensity. Such a property is not verified in Mathematical Morphology for grey level functions, when the structuring function is summed to the image with the usual additive law. In order to address this issue, a new framework is defined with an additive law for which the amplitude of the structuring function varies according to the image amplitude. This additive law is chosen within the Logarithmic Image Processing framework and models the lighting variations with a physical cause such as a change of light intensity. The new framework is named Logarithmic Mathematical Morphology (LMM) and allows the definition of operators which are robust to such lighting variations.

Abstract: The AI-based assisted diagnosis programs have been widely investigated on medical ultrasound images. Complex scenario of ultrasound image, in which the coupled interference of internal and external factors is severe, brings a unique challenge for localize the object region automatically and precisely in ultrasound images. In this study, we seek to propose a more general and robust Benchmark Attention Adaptive Framework (BAAF) to assist doctors segment or diagnose lesions and tissues in ultrasound images more quickly and accurately. Different from existing attention schemes, the BAAF consists of a parallel hybrid attention module (PHAM) and an adaptive calibration mechanism (ACM). Specifically, BAAF first coarsely calibrates the input features from the channel and spatial dimensions, and then adaptively selects more robust lesion or tissue characterizations from the coarse-calibrated feature maps. The design of BAAF further optimizes the "what" and "where" focus and selection problems in CNNs and seeks to improve the segmentation accuracy of lesions or tissues in medical ultrasound images. The method is evaluated on four medical ultrasound segmentation tasks, and the adequate experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the comparison with existing attention mechanisms also demonstrates the superiority of BAAF. This work provides the possibility for automated medical ultrasound assisted diagnosis and reduces reliance on human accuracy and precision.

Abstract: Emerging universal Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) paradigms provide an inspiring solution to light-weight and high-quality imaging with a universal model trained on a lens library (LensLib) to address arbitrary lens aberrations blindly. However, the limited coverage of existing LensLibs leads to poor generalization of the trained models to unseen lenses, whose fine-tuning pipeline is also confined to the lens-descriptions-known case. In this work, we introduce OmniLens, a flexible solution to universal CAC via (i) establishing a convincing LensLib with comprehensive coverage for pre-training a robust base model, and (ii) adapting the model to any specific lens designs with unknown lens descriptions via fast LensLib-to-specific domain adaptation. To achieve these, an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline is proposed to generate a rich variety of lens samples with realistic aberration behaviors. Then, we design an unsupervised regularization term for efficient domain adaptation on a few easily accessible real-captured images based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in degradation induced by lens aberrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LensLib generated by EAOD effectively develops a universal CAC model with strong generalization capabilities, which can also improve the non-blind lens-specific methods by 0.35-1.81dB in PSNR. Additionally, the proposed domain adaptation method significantly improves the base model, especially in severe aberration cases (at most 2.59dB in PSNR). The code and data will be available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens.

Abstract: The optimal bit-width for achieving the best trade-off between quantized model size and accuracy has been a subject of ongoing debate. While some advocate for 4-bit quantization, others propose that 1.58-bit offers superior results. However, the lack of a cohesive framework for different bits has left such conclusions relatively tenuous. We present ParetoQ, the first unified framework that facilitates rigorous comparisons across 1-bit, 1.58-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, and 4-bit quantization settings. Our findings reveal a notable learning transition between 2 and 3 bits: For 3-bits and above, the fine-tuned models stay close to their original pre-trained distributions, whereas for learning 2-bit networks or below, the representations change drastically. By optimizing training schemes and refining quantization functions, ParetoQ surpasses all previous methods tailored to specific bit widths. Remarkably, our ParetoQ ternary 600M-parameter model even outperforms the previous SoTA ternary 3B-parameter model in accuracy, using only one-fifth of the parameters. Extensive experimentation shows that ternary, 2-bit, and 3-bit quantization maintains comparable performance in the size-accuracy trade-off and generally exceeds 4-bit and binary quantization. Considering hardware constraints, 2-bit quantization offers promising potential for memory reduction and speedup.

Abstract: Real-time acquisition of accurate scene depth is essential for automated robotic minimally invasive surgery. Stereo matching with binocular endoscopy can provide this depth information. However, existing stereo matching methods, designed primarily for natural images, often struggle with endoscopic images due to fuzzy tissue boundaries and typically fail to meet real-time requirements for high-resolution endoscopic image inputs. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RRESM}, a real-time stereo matching method tailored for endoscopic images. Our approach integrates a 3D Mamba Coordinate Attention module that enhances cost aggregation through position-sensitive attention maps and long-range spatial dependency modeling via the Mamba block, generating a robust cost volume without substantial computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a High-Frequency Disparity Optimization module that refines disparity predictions near tissue boundaries by amplifying high-frequency details in the wavelet domain. Evaluations on the SCARED and SERV-CT datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art matching accuracy with a real-time inference speed of 42 FPS. The code is available at https://github.com/Sonne-Ding/RRESM.

Abstract: Realistic digital garment modeling remains a labor-intensive task due to the intricate process of translating 2D sewing patterns into high-fidelity, simulation-ready 3D garments. We introduce GarmageNet, a unified generative framework that automates the creation of 2D sewing patterns, the construction of sewing relationships, and the synthesis of 3D garment initializations compatible with physics-based simulation. Central to our approach is Garmage, a novel garment representation that encodes each panel as a structured geometry image, effectively bridging the semantic and geometric gap between 2D structural patterns and 3D garment geometries. Followed by GarmageNet, a latent diffusion transformer to synthesize panel-wise geometry images and GarmageJigsaw, a neural module for predicting point-to-point sewing connections along panel contours. To support training and evaluation, we build GarmageSet, a large-scale dataset comprising 14,801 professionally designed garments with detailed structural and style annotations. Our method demonstrates versatility and efficacy across multiple application scenarios, including scalable garment generation from multi-modal design concepts (text prompts, sketches, photographs), automatic modeling from raw flat sewing patterns, pattern recovery from unstructured point clouds, and progressive garment editing using conventional instructions, laying the foundation for fully automated, production-ready pipelines in digital fashion.

Abstract: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a recent paradigm for generating neural networks of varying width and depth. Based on Implicit Neural Representation (INR), NeuMeta learns a continuous weight manifold, enabling the direct generation of compressed models, including those with configurations not seen during training. While promising, the original formulation of NeuMeta proves effective only for the final layers of the undelying model, limiting its broader applicability. In this work, we propose a training algorithm that extends the capabilities of NeuMeta to enable full-network metamorphosis with minimal accuracy degradation. Our approach follows a structured recipe comprising block-wise incremental training, INR initialization, and strategies for replacing batch normalization. The resulting metamorphic networks maintain competitive accuracy across a wide range of compression ratios, offering a scalable solution for adaptable and efficient deployment of deep models. The code is available at: https://github.com/TSommariva/HTTY_NeuMeta.

<title>Joint Embedding vs Reconstruction: Provable Benefits of Latent Space Prediction for Self Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space. Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process, e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging datasets.

Abstract: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality, digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain --the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of 66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer interface with multiple modalities. All data, tools, and acquisition protocols are openly shared to foster open science in cognitive computing.

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy of unstained live cells is challenging due to low contrast, dynamic morphology, uneven illumination, and lack of labels. Deep learning achieved SOTA performance on stained, high-contrast images but needs large labeled datasets, expensive hardware, and fails under uneven illumination. This study presents a low-cost, lightweight, annotation-free segmentation method by introducing one-time calibration-assisted unsupervised framework adaptable across imaging modalities and image type. The framework determines background via spatial standard deviation from the local mean. Uncertain pixels are resolved using fuzzy logic, cumulative squared shift of nodal intensity, statistical features, followed by post-segmentation denoising calibration which is saved as a profile for reuse until noise pattern or object type substantially change. The program runs as a script or graphical interface for non-programmers. The method was rigorously evaluated using \textit{IoU}, \textit{F1-score}, and other metrics, with statistical significance confirmed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. On unstained brightfield myoblast (C2C12) images, it outperformed \textit{Cellpose 3.0} and \textit{StarDist}, improving IoU by up to 48\% (average IoU = 0.43, F1 = 0.60). In phase-contrast microscopy, it achieved a mean IoU of 0.69 and an F1-score of 0.81 on the \textit{LIVECell} dataset ($n = 3178$), with substantial expert agreement ($\kappa > 0.75$) confirming cross-modality robustness. Successful segmentation of laser-affected polymer surfaces further confirmed cross-domain robustness. By introducing the \textit{Homogeneous Image Plane} concept, this work provides a new theoretical foundation for training-free, annotation-free segmentation. The framework operates efficiently on CPU, avoids cell staining, and is practical for live-cell imaging and biomedical applications.

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) represent abnormal cell division associated with poor prognosis. Yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we fine-tuned the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), training only ~1.3M parameters in combination with extensive augmentation and a domain-weighted Focal Loss to handle domain heterogeneity. Despite the domain gap, our fine-tuned DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, reaching first place on the final test set. These results highlight the advantages of DINOv3 pretraining and underline the efficiency and robustness of our fine-tuning strategy, yielding state-of-the-art results for the atypical mitosis classification challenge in MIDOG 2025.

Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical application-particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility.

They introduce Alignment Regularity Characteristic (ARC) curves, which provide a spectrum of performance under various levels of regularity. By using representative deep learning DIR methods with different network architectures and transformation models, they highlight the unique insights that ARC curves offer compared to traditional evaluation practices. The authors also introduce a HyperNetwork-based approach to interpolate across the full regularization range, improving the construction and sample density of ARC curves.

Abstract: Evaluating deformable image registration (DIR) is challenging due to the inherent trade-off between achieving high alignment accuracy and maintaining deformation regularity. However, most existing DIR works either address this trade-off inadequately or overlook it altogether. In this paper, we highlight the issues with existing practices and propose an evaluation scheme that captures the trade-off continuously to holistically evaluate DIR methods. We first introduce the alignment regularity characteristic (ARC) curves, which describe the performance of a given registration method as a spectrum under various degrees of regularity. We demonstrate that the ARC curves reveal unique insights that are not evident from existing evaluation practices, using experiments on representative deep learning DIR methods with various network architectures and transformation models. We further adopt a HyperNetwork based approach that learns to continuously interpolate across the full regularization range, accelerating the construction and improving the sample density of ARC curves. Finally, we provide general guidelines for a nuanced model evaluation and selection using our evaluation scheme for both practitioners and registration researchers.

<title>Keep It on a Leash: Controllable Pseudo-label Generation Towards Realistic Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning</title>

<div> Keywords: long-tailed semi-supervised learning, Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG), dynamic filtering mechanism, Bayes-optimal classifier, class-aware adaptive augmentation

Summary:
The paper introduces a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework for long-tailed semi-supervised learning. Unlike existing methods, CPG does not assume a predefined distribution for unlabeled data, making it more robust and effective. The framework operates through a dynamic filtering mechanism that incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset. This ensures that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution, leading to improved model training. CPG also utilizes a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment and introduces a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to enhance minority class representation. By leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples, CPG achieves significant improvements in accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15.97%. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the optimization cycle in CPG can reduce generalization error under certain conditions. The code for CPG is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed). However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to $\textbf{15.97%}$ in accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts, existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain knowledge limitations.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness.

Summary: 
The article introduces Contrastive Noise Optimization to address the limited diversity issue in Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models. Existing methods optimizing intermediate latents or text conditions during inference often result in outputs collapsing into similar modes under strong text guidance. In contrast, the proposed approach shapes the initial noise latents to promote diverse outputs. By defining a contrastive loss in Tweedie data space and optimizing a batch of noise latents, diverse outputs are maximized while maintaining fidelity to a reference sample. The method is shown to achieve a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier across various T2I backbones and remains robust to hyperparameter choices. The theoretical insights provided into the mechanism of this preprocessing further support its effectiveness. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel multimodal fusion strategy called Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet) to address the challenge of detecting fake news in scenarios where modalities are incomplete. MMLNet leverages Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities, Incomplete Modality Adapters to utilize new feature distributions, and Modality Missing Learning with label-aware adaptive weighting for robust representation learning. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks across multiple languages, demonstrating superior performance and simplicity.

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has become an urgent task with the emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective. It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning. We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of fake news detection in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation, MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed. We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with 5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2 from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90 age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%, specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early Batten disease detection.

Summary:
Omni Swift Action Tokenizer is introduced to improve the efficiency of Auto-regressive (AR) models in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks. It utilizes B-Spline encoding and multi-stage residual quantization to compress action representations, shortening training sequences and reducing target entropy. The tokenization process results in faster AR training convergence and improved model performance. A cross-embodiment learning strategy is developed to leverage robot and human demonstrations for scalable auxiliary supervision. OmniSAT demonstrates higher compression rates while maintaining reconstruction quality in diverse real-robot and simulation experiments. Overall, OmniSAT offers a compact and transferable action representation, leading to more efficient AR training and improved VLA model performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining. To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer, which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training convergence and model performance.

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss), and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning. Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6% gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2% improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net, existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

Summary: 
Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle facial changes that reveal genuine emotions, valuable in lie detection and psychological assessment. A novel MER method is proposed with two key contributions. First, two complementary representations - Temporal-ranked dynamic image and Motion-intensity dynamic image - enhance discriminative ME features. Second, an Adaptive fusion network automatically integrates these representations, improving performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, MMEW) show the method's superiority.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis, and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations - Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and 0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability. The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications, including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However, deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups, overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex, real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and adaptive CVS.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, AttWarp, perceptual grounding, spatial relations, cross-modal attention

Summary:
AttWarp is a new method introduced to enhance the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by reallocating spatial resolution in cluttered scenes. By using cross-modal attention, AttWarp performs rectilinear warping of input images to prioritize query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas. This method preserves global context while making small details and spatial relations more easily discernible. Across various benchmarks and MLLMs, AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces errors. The approach outperforms competitive baselines by focusing on relevant information while maintaining overall image structure. These results indicate that attention-guided warping is effective in enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs by optimizing the distribution of image information based on query relevance. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas, all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image, reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important, without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when given such warped inputs.

Human participants engaged in tasks involving image-text pairs, revealing correlations between specific data features and participant success. Interestingly, only certain intuitive features significantly influenced performance, highlighting the necessity for further investigation into predictive factors for task success.

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

Summary:
This study addresses the issue of fixed resolution assumptions in visual large language models (VLLMs) for vision-language applications. The researchers investigate the resolution preferences of various vision-language tasks and find a correlation between resolution preferences, image complexity, and uncertainty variance of VLLMs at different image input resolutions. They propose an empirical formula to determine the optimal resolution for a given task based on these factors. Additionally, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique is introduced to extend the visual input resolution of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Rigorous experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method across a range of vision-language tasks. This research provides valuable insights for improving the performance of VLLMs in real-world applications by adapting the resolution based on task requirements. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.

Summary:
This paper explores the use of synthetic face data to improve Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD) performance, addressing the challenges of limited access to large-scale bona fide image datasets due to privacy concerns. The study employs various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation methods and implements an incremental testing protocol to assess generalization capabilities with the addition of synthetic images. Results indicate that incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images can enhance generalization, but indiscriminate use may lead to sub-optimal performance. Interestingly, utilizing only synthetic data, including morphed and non-morphed images, produces the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), suggesting that relying solely on synthetic data may not be the most effective strategy in operational scenarios. This study sheds light on the benefits and limitations of integrating synthetic face data into S-MAD systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training. However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Summary:<br />
- The paper introduces a novel pixel clustering method, Ceb, for cell instance segmentation that leverages cell boundary features and labels to separate foreground pixels into cell instances.
- Ceb extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries using a revised Watershed algorithm and constructs boundary signatures for boundary candidates by sampling pixels from the boundaries.
- A boundary classifier predicts binary boundary labels based on the boundary signatures, and cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging neighboring regions according to the predicted labels.
- Extensive experiments on six datasets show that Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art cell instance segmentation methods.
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity, which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge, we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries), to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance segmentation methods.

<div> Keywords: Vision-language models, Prompt ensemble learning, Cluster preservation, Classification logits, Adaptive prompt weighting

Summary:
Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL) addresses the limitations of conventional prompt ensembling in vision-language models. By preserving the cluster nature of context prompts, CAPEL improves classification by representing class clusters with distinct prompts. Ensembling in the classification logits space aligns better with the visual feature distribution, enhancing model performance. A cluster-preserving regularization term ensures prompt distinctiveness and prevents collapse into a uniform direction. The integration of adaptive prompt weighting dynamically adjusts attention weights for prompts, leading to robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks. Overall, CAPEL enhances the effectiveness of vision-language models by optimizing prompt ensembling and maintaining cluster-specific discriminative power. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction. Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts, ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

Summary: 
Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for association, but it can be unreliable with similar or occluded objects and is computationally expensive for segmentation masks. In this work, depth and mask features are fused and passed through a self-supervised encoder to produce stable object representations for matching. Using depth maps and object masks for fine-grained spatial cues, the MOT method refines segmentation masks without computing masks IoU. The tracking-by-detection (TBD) model, which is more computationally efficient, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and DanceTrack. Competitive performance is achieved on simpler benchmarks with linear motion, such as MOT17.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with linear motion, such as MOT17.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content (UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG: Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos, transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse, and real-world UGC dataset.

The article proposes scene-adaptive strategies for efficiently allocating representation capacity in generating immersive indoor environment experiences from incomplete observations.

Additionally, scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints are suggested to compensate for geometric deficiencies in input trajectory configurations and provide necessary regularization. By recording observation statistics on estimated geometric scaffolds, the approach enhances rendering quality and reduces memory requirements in large-scale indoor scenes.

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach called LTGS for efficient scene representation and visualization from sparse-view updates in casual captures. It addresses challenges in capturing everyday environments with frequent changes by modeling long-term scene chronology through Gaussian splatting. Object templates as template Gaussians are used to create structural priors for shared object tracks, which are refined to adapt to temporal variations. The framework is designed to be generalizable across multiple time steps and is evaluated using real-world datasets. Results show that LTGS outperforms other baselines in reconstruction quality and provides fast and lightweight updates. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to handle abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations, making it a promising solution for capturing real-world environments effectively. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures. However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Summary:
The research introduces a comprehensive framework for multi-view pose estimation in animal behavior studies. The framework combines novel training methods, post-processing techniques, and model distillation to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation, surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking. The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features, enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition, and environmental monitoring tasks.

Summary:<br /> <div>

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration, reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both general image and aligned face datasets.

Summary:
- Underwater images are essential for ocean research but often have poor quality due to environmental factors.
- Current image enhancement methods have limitations in generalization and dataset quality.
- Lack of diversity and low-quality images in datasets hinders progress.
- Proposed solution includes expanding datasets with various image types using a denoising diffusion model.
- Advise using Controlnet to evaluate and improve dataset quality for better study of the marine ecosystem.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets, and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

<div> Implicit Neural Representations, longitudinal MRI data, brain aging trajectories, deep learning, dementia-like subjects <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel method for representing aging trajectories in the human brain using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model subject-specific longitudinal MRI data. Traditional deep learning methods struggle with discrete neuroimaging data due to different spatial and temporal sampling patterns, which the INR-based approach overcomes by representing the data as continuous functions. The study develops a biologically grounded trajectory simulation to generate MRI data for healthy and dementia-like subjects at regular and irregular timepoints. In the experiment with irregular sampling, the INR-based method outperforms a standard deep learning model, achieving an accuracy of 81.3% in classifying brain aging trajectories. This research contributes to a better understanding of the structural changes in the aging brain and provides a more effective tool for analyzing longitudinal neuroimaging data. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

<div> Keywords: Segmentation models, human-in-the-loop, interventional learning, dataset biases, data-efficient

Summary:
This article introduces a human-in-the-loop interactive framework for improving segmentation models by incorporating human corrections to address spurious correlations and enhance real-world performance. The system leverages human interventions to guide the model towards more robust, semantically meaningful features and away from dataset-specific artifacts. Through iterative feedback, the framework effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points on challenging cubemap data, reduces annotation effort by 3-4 times compared to standard retraining, and maintains competitive performance on benchmark datasets. The approach systematically identifies and corrects model failure modes to improve generalization in diverse domains like urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving. Overall, this framework offers practical guidance for building accurate, robust, data-efficient segmentation systems adaptable to real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Summary: <br />
Challenges affecting accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection include diverse imaging devices, inconsistent lighting conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To address these challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this study. The framework includes the use of a multi-scenario dataset, STP-AgriData, to tackle tone variation. Data augmentations for lighting conditions, and a novel REAS-Det network for object scale variation and occlusion. The proposed network achieved high precision (87.6%), recall (74.9%), mAP@.50 (82.8%), and mAP@.50:.95 (53.3%) metrics, outperforming existing detection methods. The network incorporates RFAConv and C3RFEM modules for scale variation, MultiSEAM and soft-NMS for occlusion, demonstrating superior performance. The study paves the way for accurate quantity detection of Shatian pomelo in agricultural settings to meet commercial demands for lean production. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset, STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art detection methods.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions, is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model. Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&amp;Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of 1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across architectures and datasets.

Summary: This study introduces an AI-based framework that utilizes existing traffic camera infrastructure for accurate and scalable traffic monitoring. By fine-tuning a YOLOv11 model on localized urban scenes, the framework extracts multimodal traffic density and classification metrics in real time. A novel graph-based viewpoint normalization method addresses inconsistencies from non-stationary cameras. Additionally, a large language model processes massive data to generate automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns. Validated using over 9 million images from NYC traffic cameras during congestion pricing rollout, results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicle density in the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions, and increased pedestrian and cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Example-based prompts improve the numerical accuracy of the large language model and reduce hallucinations. This framework has the potential to be a practical solution for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

Summary: 
The study focuses on addressing the challenge of lens flare in images by proposing a physics-informed method for flare data generation. This method involves creating parameterized templates, applying the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and utilizing a physical engine for 3D rendering. The resulting dataset, FlareX, combines both 2D and 3D perspectives, offering 9,500 2D templates and 3,000 flare image pairs. Additionally, a masking approach is designed to extract real-world flare-free images from corrupted ones, enabling the evaluation of model performance on real-world images. Through extensive experiments, the effectiveness of the method and dataset in improving model generalization to real-world scenarios is demonstrated. <div>
arXiv:2510.09995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation, the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both 2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and dataset.

Summary:
The article addresses flicker artifacts in short-exposure images caused by rolling shutter cameras and AC-powered lighting variations. These artifacts manifest as uneven brightness distribution and affect tasks like object detection. The lack of a large-scale dataset hinders flicker removal research progress. To fill this gap, BurstDeflicker dataset is introduced through three data acquisition methods. A Retinex-based synthesis pipeline allows manipulation of flicker attributes for diverse patterns. Real-world images capture spatial and temporal flicker characteristics, enhancing model generalization. A green-screen method introduces motion in image pairs for dynamic scenes. Experimental results showcase the dataset's effectiveness in advancing flicker removal research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting. These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity, area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker removal.

Unified medical vision language model MIMO is introduced, incorporating visual referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. A comprehensive multimodal dataset, MIMOSeg, is developed with 895K samples. MIMO combines visual clues and text instructions, and grounds medical terminologies in the image output. Experiment results demonstrate MIMO's effectiveness in various medical multimodal tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

Summary:
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter) is introduced as a lightweight visual adapter module for enhancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in video captioning tasks. By incorporating learnable query tokens and a gating layer into the Vision Encoder, Q-Adapter efficiently extracts sparse, caption-relevant features without the need for external textual supervision. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MSR-VTT and MSVD video captioning datasets, surpassing traditional fine-tuning approaches while using only 1.4% of the parameters. Additionally, the study provides insights into key hyperparameters and design choices that impact fine-tuning effectiveness, offering optimization strategies for adapter-based learning. These results demonstrate the potential of Q-Adapter in achieving a balance between caption quality and parameter efficiency, showcasing its scalability in video-language modeling.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning" paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task. Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness, providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning. These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for video-language modeling.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance, especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this, we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to \textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and real-world scenes, respectively.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames. Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

Summary:
ViTAR is a new framework for medical vision-language models that mimics the iterative reasoning process of human experts, enabling multi-step visual reasoning. By treating medical images as interactive objects and incorporating expert-like diagnostic behaviors in the training data, ViTAR outperforms existing models. The two-stage training strategy includes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making. Visual attention analysis shows that ViTAR increasingly focuses on clinically critical regions during the reasoning process, leading to improved performance. This approach enhances both the accuracy and reliability of medical AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues. In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising 1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the "think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and other related areas.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically, we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

<div> Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs, Masked Autoencoders, computer vision, multi-modal learning, data pipeline
Summary:
Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE) is a novel approach that combines neural graphs with masked autoencoders for self-supervised pre-training in computer vision tasks. By randomly masking entire modalities, the model samples from the distribution of hyper-edges, improving performance and consistency. The model integrates pre-training and fine-tuning in a single loop and enables inference-time ensembles for enhanced prediction. Knowledge distillation can be applied to ensembles with minimal loss in performance, even with small models. The approach is demonstrated in outdoor UAV scenes but can be adapted to other domains like autonomous driving. A data-pipeline software streamlines the integration of pre-trained models for multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL), with an automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset provided. Technical details, code, and reproduction steps are publicly available.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset. All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

<div> Keywords: large-scale landslide scars, spatiotemporal evolution, vision foundation model, video segmentation, early warning<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a novel framework for tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a vision foundation model. By converting discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video sequence, the framework leverages a vision model developed for video segmentation to track landslide scar evolution. The framework incorporates knowledge-guided, auto-propagation, and interactive refinement techniques to ensure accurate identification of landslide scars. Through validation on the Baige and Sela landslides, the framework successfully tracks the evolution of landslide scars, enabling the identification of failure precursors for early warning and post-failure evolution assessment. This approach proves valuable for understanding mechanisms and precursors of landslides and assessing long-term stability and secondary hazards.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors, enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification. Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided, auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars, capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

Summary:
Gesplat introduces a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis that overcomes the limitations of existing methods like Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. By leveraging the VGGT foundation model for initial poses and point clouds, Gesplat enables robust reconstruction from sparse, unposed images. Key innovations include a hybrid Gaussian representation, graph-guided attribute refinement, and flow-based depth regularization for improved depth estimation accuracy. The approach demonstrates superior performance on various datasets, outperforming pose-dependent methods. Gesplat's ability to generate geometrically consistent reconstructions and high-quality novel views without the need for accurate camera poses makes it a promising solution for applications in sparse-view settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Clients estimate pseudo label distribution, which is adjusted by the server to prevent class imbalances. A partial prompt aggregation protocol is implemented for effective collaboration and personalization, with visual prompts aggregated centrally and text prompts kept locally.

arXiv:2510.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative \underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to baseline methods.

<br />
Summary: 
Recent research has shown that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards can improve reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs) for complex tasks like video and image understanding. However, existing methods may lead to inconsistencies between the reasoning process and final answers. To address this issue, Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) modifies the standard GRPO algorithm by introducing an auxiliary consistency check. ACRE prompts the model to predict a second answer after generating a chain of thought and initial answer for a question, with shuffled answer options. By designing a consistency-verification reward that rewards agreement between original and post-shuffle answers, ACRE mitigates reasoning-answer misalignment and biases. Experiments on challenging Video Reasoning and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks show that ACRE outperforms the GRPO baseline, achieving significant improvements in answer consistency and correctness. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check. After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\% and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the GRPO baseline.

Summary: <br />
Accurate fire and smoke detection are crucial for safety and disaster response. Vision-based methods like YOLOv5n and YOLOv8n are popular but may result in false positives and missed detections due to reduced capacity. Conventional post-detection techniques like Non-Maximum Suppression sometimes fail in cluttered fire scenes. To address these issues, a new uncertainty-aware post-detection framework is proposed. This framework incorporates statistical uncertainty and domain-specific visual cues to rescale detection confidences using a Confidence Refinement Network. Experiments on the D-Fire dataset show enhanced precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing methods, with minimal computational overhead. Post-detection rescoring proves to be effective in improving the robustness of compact deep learning models for fire and smoke detection. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke detection.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Summary: 
Immersive iris recognition in egocentric applications is becoming popular, but traditional systems designed for on-axis iris imagery face challenges in off-axis acquisition. The ImmerIris dataset, containing over 499,000 ocular images from 564 subjects, addresses this gap as one of the largest public datasets for off-axis acquisition. Evaluation protocols based on ImmerIris highlight the shortcomings of current recognition methods, primarily due to normalization techniques. A normalization-free paradigm proposed in this paper shows superior performance by directly learning from ocular images with minimal adjustment. This approach offers a promising direction for robust recognition in immersive settings, indicating the importance of adapting techniques for off-axis iris acquisition in applications such as augmented and virtual reality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion, intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture. Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets, containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment. Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust immersive recognition.

Summary: 
This study proposes a novel multi-class Parkinson's disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced CNN BiLSTM model. The researchers collected finger tapping videos and extracted temporal, frequency, and amplitude features from wrist and hand movements. The hybrid deep learning framework, integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms, demonstrated promising results in classifying PD severity levels. The model reshapes input sequences, captures spatial dependencies through a Conv1D MaxPooling block, and models temporal dynamics using BiLSTM layers. An attention mechanism highlights informative temporal features, improving the model's performance in distinguishing between severity classes. The integration of spatial-temporal representations with attention mechanisms shows potential for non-invasive PD severity detection, offering a valuable tool for clinicians in monitoring and tracking disease progression. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency, and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently, low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed. According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7 percent according to the validation set.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues, three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference. Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline - while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%. Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments, showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

<div> Keywords: Color3D, 3D colorization, dynamic scenes, personalized colorizer, Lab color space<br />
Summary: <br />
Color3D is a new framework for colorizing both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs. It preserves color diversity and controllability, while ensuring consistency across views and time steps. By colorizing a single key view and fine-tuning a personalized colorizer, the method can propagate colors to novel views and frames. This personalized colorizer learns a scene-specific color mapping, enabling consistent projection of colors. The framework simplifies 3D colorization by treating it as a single image problem, allowing integration of different colorization models. Extensive experiments show that Color3D produces more consistent and chromatically rich 3D renderings with precise user control. The framework uses Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation for direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes. Overall, Color3D provides a flexible and versatile solution for realistic and visually appealing 3D colorization. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.10152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view, enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control.

<title>ReMix: Towards a Unified View of Consistent Character Generation and Editing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10156</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10156</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1) have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts, pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

<title>SaFiRe: Saccade-Fixation Reiteration with Mamba for Referring Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>SparseUWSeg: Active Sparse Point-Label Augmentation for Underwater Semantic Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models. The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool, integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks to process their data.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual concepts. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/CristianoPatricio/viconex-med.

<title>HccePose(BF): Predicting Front \&amp; Back Surfaces to Construct Ultra-Dense 2D-3D Correspondences for Pose Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However, current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/WangYuLin-SEU/HCCEPose.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time, high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos. Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings, environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset and method. The code and dataset will be released.

<title>Fairness Without Labels: Pseudo-Balancing for Bias Mitigation in Face Gender Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2) stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81% overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

arXiv:2510.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary relational perception in 3D localization.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system, developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5 million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare cancer classification and multimodal Q&amp;A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

<title>A Style-Based Metric for Quantifying the Synthetic-to-Real Gap in Autonomous Driving Image Datasets</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies}, including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}. Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric (\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary, AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and interpretable AIGC forensics.

<title>Are Video Models Emerging as Zero-Shot Learners and Reasoners in Medical Imaging?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10254</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan, producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on 4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation models built on video models.

<title>Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<title>Bridging Perspectives: Foundation Model Guided BEV Maps for 3D Object Detection and Tracking</title>

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2 features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however, fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets, SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation, respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7 percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\% inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\% reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of AI-driven monitoring systems.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However, existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud completion.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion. Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact, surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks, notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations, such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other 2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets, Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior, enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

<title>Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box", where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning, not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller, non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly, making classification more challenging. The second method involves the application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms, and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without the need to use background information.

Abstract: Audiovisual video captioning aims to generate semantically rich descriptions with temporal alignment between visual and auditory events, thereby benefiting both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we present AVoCaDO, a powerful audiovisual video captioner driven by the temporal orchestration between audio and visual modalities. We propose a two-stage post-training pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT, which fine-tunes the model on a newly curated dataset of 107K high-quality, temporally-aligned audiovisual captions; and (2) AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance temporal coherence and dialogue accuracy while regularizing caption length and reducing collapse. Experimental results demonstrate that AVoCaDO significantly outperforms existing open-source models across four audiovisual video captioning benchmarks, and also achieves competitive performance on the VDC and DREAM-1K benchmark under visual-only settings.

<title>Mesh-Gait: A Unified Framework for Gait Recognition Through Multi-Modal Representation Learning from 2D Silhouettes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

<title>Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order</title>

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks. Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper, we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset, self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate feature matching than the traditional method.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments. Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances (up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data, achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data, providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing user comfort in VR applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities, positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors, but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment (reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward trustworthy reasoning.

<title>MonoSE(3)-Diffusion: A Monocular SE(3) Diffusion Framework for Robust Camera-to-Robot Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses, thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks (DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

<title>On the Problem of Consistent Anomalies in Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data. Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies -- similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.'' CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation, yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across architectures.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability (IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11% and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules: (1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA), progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient (PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The dataset and code are available.

<title>When Images Speak Louder: Mitigating Language Bias-induced Hallucinations in VLMs through Cross-Modal Guidance</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features. Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion. Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

<title>MSF-Mamba: Motion-aware State Fusion Mamba for Efficient Micro-Gesture Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10478</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently, Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models (SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition, previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba (MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely, MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

<title>Towards Self-Refinement of Vision-Language Models with Triangular Consistency</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle, any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/dengyl20/SRF-LLaVA-1.5.

<title>Head-wise Adaptive Rotary Positional Encoding for Fine-Grained Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation, axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention, producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh. The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures. Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene styling, and tileable texture generation.

<title>VR-Thinker: Boosting Video Reward Models through Thinking-with-Image Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2510.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning; and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6% on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

<title>Receptive Field Expanded Look-Up Tables for Vision Inference: Advancing from Low-level to High-level Tasks</title>

arXiv:2510.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal, various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies, divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved generalization over single-modality approaches.

arXiv:2510.10533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification. Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues, enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion, and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance applications.

<title>MCE: Towards a General Framework for Handling Missing Modalities under Imbalanced Missing Rates</title>

arXiv:2510.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The journal preprint version is now available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2025.112591. Our code is available at https://github.com/byzhaoAI/MCE.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution, GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11. Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network (RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance. Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are 0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters and GFLOPs are reduced by 44.2% and 17.5%, respectively. It is demonstrated that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object detection in railroad transmission lines.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis of our proposed joint learning strategy.

<title>UniFlow: A Unified Pixel Flow Tokenizer for Visual Understanding and Generation</title>

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7 widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks, but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without guidance), respectively.

<title>Injecting Frame-Event Complementary Fusion into Diffusion for Optical Flow in Challenging Scenes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10577</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

<title>Equipping Vision Foundation Model with Mixture of Experts for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10584</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this, we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution. This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories, improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

<title>A Simple and Better Baseline for Visual Grounding</title>

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities, there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration, linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding, called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/jcwang0602/FSVG.

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs) include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge, whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT, RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

arXiv:2510.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training, using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and text-image alignment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually. However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition, underlining our manual specification-free definition.

<title>Stability Under Scrutiny: Benchmarking Representation Paradigms for Online HD Mapping</title>

arXiv:2510.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy, while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable facial representations to boost generalization across various face security tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically, we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training, vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent efficiency-performance trade-off.

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First, we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks. The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data and computational requirements associated with training video-language foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions. While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover, in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14, TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset -- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation for future action understanding research.

arXiv:2510.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction. In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes. We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

<title>Structured Spectral Graph Learning for Multi-label Abnormality Classification in 3D Chest CT Scans</title>

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload. Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

<title>DISC-GAN: Disentangling Style and Content for Cluster-Specific Synthetic Underwater Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN (DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains. We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.3728.

<title>ImHead: A Large-scale Implicit Morphable Model for Localized Head Modeling</title>

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars. However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead, we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation, allowing the user to make localized edits.

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells (Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2 (CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories: clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs. These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques, including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

<title>FastHMR: Accelerating Human Mesh Recovery via Token and Layer Merging with Diffusion Decoding</title>

arXiv:2510.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over real-world data.

<title>Where on Earth? A Vision-Language Benchmark for Probing Model Geolocation Skills Across Scales</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches 34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases, achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&amp;CO. Beyond VLMs, the proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological alignment into representation learning.

<title>SceneTextStylizer: A Training-Free Scene Text Style Transfer Framework with Diffusion Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and text preservation.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing. DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual descriptions. Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing GAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization, color-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with textual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.

arXiv:2510.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

arXiv:2510.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training, improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

<title>Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or (iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out of distribution.

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning, thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on 3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models, introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question answering (QA) scenarios.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM), which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal robustness.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems, research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static, passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation, whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii) Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also actively update a public repository at https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work, we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views, PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.

<title>ContextGen: Contextual Layout Anchoring for Identity-Consistent Multi-Instance Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11000</link>

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA), an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and overall visual quality.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas. Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform, extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

<title>COCO-Tree: Compositional Hierarchical Concept Trees for Enhanced Reasoning in Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image. Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground, EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

<title>High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Modeling with Global-Local State Space Models for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11017</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity; however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE. Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better computational trade-offs.

<title>GeoVLMath: Enhancing Geometry Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Cross-Modal Reward for Auxiliary Line Creation</title>

arXiv:2510.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of 3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency (GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset, we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at \href{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}.

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data. Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks. However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP metrics, respectively.

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i) early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892, F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks. Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for AI-driven research to support clinical decisions in laryngeal oncology.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting, etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&amp;F}$ metrics for VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient, language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Abstract: Patient face images provide a convenient mean for evaluating eye diseases, while also raising privacy concerns. Here, we introduce ROFI, a deep learning-based privacy protection framework for ophthalmology. Using weakly supervised learning and neural identity translation, ROFI anonymizes facial features while retaining disease features (over 98\% accuracy, $\kappa > 0.90$). It achieves 100\% diagnostic sensitivity and high agreement ($\kappa > 0.90$) across eleven eye diseases in three cohorts, anonymizing over 95\% of images. ROFI works with AI systems, maintaining original diagnoses ($\kappa > 0.80$), and supports secure image reversal (over 98\% similarity), enabling audits and long-term care. These results show ROFI's effectiveness of protecting patient privacy in the digital medicine era.

arXiv:2510.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks, enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion; and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

<title>Text-Enhanced Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings</title>

arXiv:2510.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex CAD drawings.

<title>Future-Aware End-to-End Driving: Bidirectional Modeling of Trajectory Planning and Scene Evolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of MLLMs in real world applications.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example, ``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion, which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically consistent 3D scene motion.

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression, yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse, irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static (anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs, prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification and general ICU prediction tasks.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces, transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Demystifying Numerosity in Diffusion Models -- Limitations and Remedies</title>

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6 featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization across settings.

<title>video-SALMONN S: Streaming Audio-Visual LLMs Beyond Length Limits via Memory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces (i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging, and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro), video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with 10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and 67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming baselines.

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images, using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

<title>Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11171</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them. However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture. Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

<title>CoPRS: Learning Positional Prior from Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text, which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation. Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation. Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

<title>Reliable Cross-modal Alignment via Prototype Iterative Construction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information. However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 5.2\%-14.1\%.

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding. We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset, BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16 regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant (Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000 multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation. BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge; models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language (SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation. In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models' performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

<title>FlexAC: Towards Flexible Control of Associative Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.

arXiv:2510.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names' vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation, we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at https://github.com/rohit-gupta/MMContrast/tree/main/APPROVE

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics, extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images. Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942, precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives. Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the dataset, achieving classification accuracies of 90.45% and 88.78%, respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in sign recognition tasks, particularly within low-resource settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic effort to construct a benchmark dataset and assess deep learning approaches for NSL recognition, highlighting the potential of transfer learning and fine-tuning for advancing research in underexplored sign languages.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG) modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy and better generalization across various clinical settings.

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

<title>Exploring and Leveraging Class Vectors for Classifier Editing</title>

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and adversarial trigger optimization.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation, combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach, ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU, enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018 confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

<title>Human Uncertainty-Aware Data Selection and Automatic Labeling in Visual Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11295</link>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially, real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

<title>$\Delta \mathrm{Energy}$: Optimizing Energy Change During Vision-Language Alignment Improves both OOD Detection and OOD Generalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11296</link>

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian, which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by 10% to 25% in AUROC.

<title>When Does Supervised Training Pay Off? The Hidden Economics of Object Detection in the Era of Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11302</link>

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on 1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2% accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for 100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond 55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year. Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories (ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance metrics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic bridging and symmetry-aware design.

<title>Evaluating the effects of preprocessing, method selection, and hyperparameter tuning on SAR-based flood mapping and water depth estimation</title>

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River (France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers. Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Abstract: Interactive 3D scenes are increasingly vital for embodied intelligence, yet existing datasets remain limited due to the labor-intensive process of annotating part segmentation, kinematic types, and motion trajectories. We present REACT3D, a scalable zero-shot framework that converts static 3D scenes into simulation-ready interactive replicas with consistent geometry, enabling direct use in diverse downstream tasks. Our contributions include: (i) openable-object detection and segmentation to extract candidate movable parts from static scenes, (ii) articulation estimation that infers joint types and motion parameters, (iii) hidden-geometry completion followed by interactive object assembly, and (iv) interactive scene integration in widely supported formats to ensure compatibility with standard simulation platforms. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on detection/segmentation and articulation metrics across diverse indoor scenes, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and providing a practical foundation for scalable interactive scene generation, thereby lowering the barrier to large-scale research on articulated scene understanding.

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.

<title>MMAP: A Multi-Magnification and Prototype-Aware Architecture for Predicting Spatial Gene Expression</title>

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and (2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).

<title>Uncertainty-Aware ControlNet: Bridging Domain Gaps with Synthetic Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene experiment.

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering (PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling, resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end, we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with 2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel views synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high- and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively, and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6 and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7% win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward producing human-preferred documents.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects. Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features (i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/juneyeeHu/LM-EEC.

<title>Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness on Inland Waterways: A YOLO-Based Fusion of Satellite and AIS for Vessel Characterization</title>

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550 instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification (tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1 score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1 score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded 93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets, incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further enhance operational scalability.

<title>Coupled Degradation Modeling and Fusion: A VLM-Guided Degradation-Coupled Network for Degradation-Aware Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques. This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression. Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor (SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios.

<title>VA-GS: Enhancing the Geometric Representation of Gaussian Splatting via View Alignment</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment. In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoR

<title>Towards Fast and Scalable Normal Integration using Continuous Components</title>

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision, dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

arXiv:2510.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages 11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

arXiv:2510.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

arXiv:2510.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled, scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities. Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users. Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing multi-modal walking assistance.

<title>Massive Activations are the Key to Local Detail Synthesis in Diffusion Transformers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11538</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations} (MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail \textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

<title>ODI-Bench: Can MLLMs Understand Immersive Omnidirectional Environments?</title>

arXiv:2510.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10 fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20 representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50 baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential samples for targeted performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts). Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer, resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in \textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries, enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for scalable 3D annotation.

<title>A Framework for Low-Effort Training Data Generation for Urban Semantic Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11567</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11567</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation, object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance. Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for urban scene understanding.

arXiv:2510.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery: HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%), DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of 93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved 91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

<title>MS-Mix: Unveiling the Power of Mixup for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS) strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment augmentation.

<title>ACE-G: Improving Generalization of Scene Coordinate Regression Through Query Pre-Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11605</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

arXiv:2510.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However, their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process: (1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19 leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

<title>High-resolution Photo Enhancement in Real-time: A Laplacian Pyramid Network</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

<title>NV3D: Leveraging Spatial Shape Through Normal Vector-based 3D Object Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11632</link>

arXiv:2510.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity, narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity, integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based assessments.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting, fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only 9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end. It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm, and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding. Our implementation is publicly available at https://yuxuan-xue.com/physic.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity, age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process, thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE (Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning, enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

<title>Beyond 'Templates': Category-Agnostic Object Pose, Size, and Shape Estimation from a Single View</title>

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL, spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty, propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer training.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically, it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for more efficient and robust image classification.

<title>DiT360: High-Fidelity Panoramic Image Generation via Hybrid Training</title>

arXiv:2510.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DiT360.

<title>Point Prompting: Counterfactual Tracking with Video Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2510.11715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

<title>Ev4DGS: Novel-view Rendering of Non-Rigid Objects from Monocular Event Streams</title>

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only. This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS, i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images) from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/Ev4DGS/.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance, such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems. Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples. Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

<title>Gradient-Sign Masking for Task Vector Transport Across Pre-Trained Models</title>

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.

<title>Semantic-Cohesive Knowledge Distillation for Deep Cross-modal Hashing</title>

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However, they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing, dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt, depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across its business units.

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models (VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs. Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty, diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts, a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

<title>Causality $\neq$ Decodability, and Vice Versa: Lessons from Interpreting Counting ViTs</title>

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.

This is because most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data (T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process. Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation, depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

<title>MTMD: A Multi-Task Multi-Domain Framework for Unified Ad Lightweight Ranking at Pinterest</title>

Abstract: The lightweight ad ranking layer, living after the retrieval stage and before the fine ranker, plays a critical role in the success of a cascaded ad recommendation system. Due to the fact that there are multiple optimization tasks depending on the ad domain, e.g., Click Through Rate (CTR) for click ads and Conversion Rate (CVR) for conversion ads, as well as multiple surfaces where an ad is served (home feed, search, or related item recommendation) with diverse ad products (shopping or standard ad); it is an essentially challenging problem in industry on how to do joint holistic optimization in the lightweight ranker, such that the overall platform's value, advertiser's value, and user's value are maximized.
  Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) can handle multiple goals naturally, with each prediction head mapping to a particular optimization goal. However, in practice, it is unclear how to unify data from different surfaces and ad products into a single model. It is critical to learn domain-specialized knowledge and explicitly transfer knowledge between domains to make MTL effective. We present a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture under the classic Two-Tower paradigm, with the following key contributions: 1) handle different prediction tasks, ad products, and ad serving surfaces in a unified framework; 2) propose a novel mixture-of-expert architecture to learn both specialized knowledge each domain and common knowledge shared between domains; 3) propose a domain adaption module to encourage knowledge transfer between experts; 4) constrain the modeling of different prediction tasks. MTMD improves the offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction in cost per click. We have deployed this single MTMD framework into production for Pinterest ad recommendation replacing 9 production models.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is widely recognized as essential for neural compression, yet balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff remains challenging. This difficulty is especially pronounced in video compression, where frame-wise quality fluctuations often cause perceptually optimized neural video codecs to suffer from flickering artifacts. In this paper, inspired by the success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video Compression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression. GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a perceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints from the rate-distortion optimization. We redesign the codec architecture explicitly for the latent domain, drawing on extensive insights from prior neural video codecs, and further equip it with innovations such as unified intra/inter coding and a recurrent memory mechanism. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that GLVC achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of DISTS and LPIPS metrics. Notably, our user study confirms GLVC rivals the latest neural video codecs at nearly half their rate while maintaining stable temporal coherence, marking a step toward practical perceptual video compression.

<title>CLoD-GS: Continuous Level-of-Detail via 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09997</link>

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets.

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words) to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively. Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast, convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper, we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named {\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention.

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes 2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9 representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose, agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1) a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing trustworthy web agent deployment.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of robust, in-the-wild imaging using ultra-thin nanophotonic metalens cameras. Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration, pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures. Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior after deployment.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution. However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic MLP and emerging KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect the response to signals of varying frequencies. Building on this analysis, we introduce INR-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for multimodal INR tasks. It includes 56 variants of Coordinate-MLP models (featuring 4 types of positional encoding and 14 activation functions) and 22 Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9 implicit multimodal tasks. These tasks cover both forward and inverse problems, offering a robust platform to highlight the strengths and limitations of different neural models, thereby establishing a solid foundation for future research. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lif314/INR-Bench.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment, heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich, diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity. Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities, from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments, and tasks.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic, two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2 leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations, even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic, reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially harmful and offensive model outputs.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations. This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy, enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters, consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners. Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by (i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under < 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off, delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for edge deployment.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses. Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulation methods solve wave equations numerically, achieving high accuracy but at substantial computational cost. Faster alternatives based on convolution with precomputed impulse responses remain relatively slow, often requiring several minutes to generate a full B-mode image. We introduce UltraScatter, a probabilistic ray tracing framework that models ultrasound scattering efficiently and realistically. Tissue is represented as a volumetric field of scattering probability and scattering amplitude, and ray interactions are simulated via free-flight delta tracking. Scattered rays are traced to the transducer, with phase information incorporated through a linear time-of-flight model. Integrated with plane-wave imaging and beamforming, our parallelized ray tracing architecture produces B-mode images within seconds. Validation with phantom data shows realistic speckle and inclusion patterns, positioning UltraScatter as a scalable alternative to wave-based methods.

<title>ImpMIA: Leveraging Implicit Bias for Membership Inference Attack under Realistic Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples. This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Abstract: Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-guided pre-filter is a promising technique for improving the perceptual compression efficiency of image coding. However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters. Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform. The open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/viplab-fudan/FJNDF-Pytorch.

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead. Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines, offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond the constraints of textual descriptions.

<title>Optimally Deep Networks -- Adapting Model Depth to Datasets for Superior Efficiency</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical. To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Abstract: The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems (CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$) by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

<title>Into the Unknown: Towards using Generative Models for Sampling Priors of Environment Uncertainty for Planning in Configuration Spaces</title>

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics, formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

<title>The Easy Path to Robustness: Coreset Selection using Sample Hardness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its \textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm (AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN) are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary. Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\% and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

<title>Lightweight Facial Landmark Detection in Thermal Images via Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer</title>

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while drastically reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life, ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions. Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465 trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at https://scoopdiff.github.io/.

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at https://github.com/LCO-Embedding/LCO-Embedding.

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs.

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks. Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning process or non-robust inputs.

Abstract: Existing long-tailed classification (LT) methods only focus on tackling the class-wise imbalance that head classes have more samples than tail classes, but overlook the attribute-wise imbalance. In fact, even if the class is balanced, samples within each class may still be long-tailed due to the varying attributes. Note that the latter is fundamentally more ubiquitous and challenging than the former because attributes are not just implicit for most datasets, but also combinatorially complex, thus prohibitively expensive to be balanced. Therefore, we introduce a novel research problem: Generalized Long-Tailed classification (GLT), to jointly consider both kinds of imbalances. By "generalized", we mean that a GLT method should naturally solve the traditional LT, but not vice versa. Not surprisingly, we find that most class-wise LT methods degenerate in our proposed two benchmarks: ImageNet-GLT and MSCOCO-GLT. We argue that it is because they over-emphasize the adjustment of class distribution while neglecting to learn attribute-invariant features. To this end, we propose an Invariant Feature Learning (IFL) method as the first strong baseline for GLT. IFL first discovers environments with divergent intra-class distributions from the imperfect predictions and then learns invariant features across them. Promisingly, as an improved feature backbone, IFL boosts all the LT line-up: one/two-stage re-balance, augmentation, and ensemble. Codes and benchmarks are available on Github: https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Generalized-Long-Tailed-Benchmarks.pytorch

Abstract: Out-Of-Distribution generalization (OOD) is all about learning invariance against environmental changes. If the context in every class is evenly distributed, OOD would be trivial because the context can be easily removed due to an underlying principle: class is invariant to context. However, collecting such a balanced dataset is impractical. Learning on imbalanced data makes the model bias to context and thus hurts OOD. Therefore, the key to OOD is context balance. We argue that the widely adopted assumption in prior work, the context bias can be directly annotated or estimated from biased class prediction, renders the context incomplete or even incorrect. In contrast, we point out the everoverlooked other side of the above principle: context is also invariant to class, which motivates us to consider the classes (which are already labeled) as the varying environments to resolve context bias (without context labels). We implement this idea by minimizing the contrastive loss of intra-class sample similarity while assuring this similarity to be invariant across all classes. On benchmarks with various context biases and domain gaps, we show that a simple re-weighting based classifier equipped with our context estimation achieves state-of-the-art performance. We provide the theoretical justifications in Appendix and codes on https://github.com/simpleshinobu/IRMCon.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{Information Topology}: a framework that unifies information theory and algebraic topology by treating \emph{cycle closure} as the primitive operation of inference. The starting point is the \emph{dot-cycle dichotomy}, which separates pointwise, order-sensitive fluctuations (dots) from order-invariant, predictive structure (cycles). Algebraically, closure is the cancellation of boundaries ($\partial^2=0$), which converts transient histories into stable invariants. Building on this, we derive the \emph{Structure-Before-Specificity} (SbS) principle: stable information resides in nontrivial homology classes that persist under perturbations, while high-entropy contextual details act as scaffolds. The \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP) quantifies this balance by decomposing uncertainty into contextual spread and content precision, showing why prediction requires invariance for generalization. Measure concentration onto residual invariant manifolds explains \emph{order invariance}: when mass collapses to a narrow tube around a closed cycle, reparameterizations of micro-steps leave predictive functionals unchanged. We then define \emph{homological capacity}, the topological dual of Shannon capacity, as the sustainable number of independent informational cycles supported by a system. This capacity links dynamical (KS) entropy to structural (homological) capacity and refines Euler characteristics from a ``net'' summary to a ``gross'' count of persistent invariants. Finally, we illustrate the theory across three domains where \emph{more is different}: \textbf{visual binding}, \textbf{working memory}, and \textbf{access consciousness}. Together, these results recast inference, learning, and communication as \emph{topological stabilization}: the formation, closure, and persistence of informational cycles that make prediction robust and scalable.

Abstract: Camouflaged objects that blend into natural scenes pose significant challenges for deep-learning models to detect and synthesize. While camouflaged object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with diverse real-world applications, this research topic has been constrained by limited data availability. We propose a framework for synthesizing camouflage data to enhance the detection of camouflaged objects in natural scenes. Our approach employs a generative model to produce realistic camouflage images, which can be used to train existing object detection models. Specifically, we use a camouflage environment generator supervised by a camouflage distribution classifier to synthesize the camouflage images, which are then fed into our generator to expand the dataset. Our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on three datasets (COD10k, CAMO, and CHAMELEON), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving camouflaged object detection. This approach can serve as a plug-and-play data generation and augmentation module for existing camouflaged object detection tasks and provides a novel way to introduce more diversity and distributions into current camouflage datasets.

Abstract: Predicting crowd intentions and trajectories is critical for a range of real-world applications, involving social robotics and autonomous driving. Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.

Abstract: Today, the family of latent diffusion models (LDMs) has gained prominence for its high quality outputs and scalability. This has also raised security concerns on social media, as malicious users can create and disseminate harmful content. Existing approaches typically involve training specific components or entire generative models to embed a watermark in generated images for traceability and responsibility. However, in the fast-evolving era of AI-generated content (AIGC), the rapid iteration and modification of LDMs makes retraining with watermark models costly. To address the problem, we propose MarkPlugger, a generalizable plug-and-play watermark framework without LDM retraining. In particular, to reduce the disturbance of the watermark on the semantics of the generated image, we try to identify a watermark representation that is approaching orthogonal to the semantic in latent space, and apply an additive fusion strategy for the watermark and the semantic. Without modifying any components of the LDMs, we embed diverse watermarks in latent space, adapting to the denoising process. Our experimental findings reveal that our method effectively harmonizes image quality and watermark recovery rate. We also have validated that our method is generalized to multiple official versions and modified variants of LDMs, even without retraining the watermark model. Furthermore, it performs robustly under various attacks of different intensities.

Abstract: The construction of vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps from onboard surround-view cameras has become a significant focus in autonomous driving. However, current map vector estimation pipelines face two key limitations: input-agnostic queries struggle to capture complex map structures, and the view transformation leads to information loss. These issues often result in inaccurate shape restoration or missing instances in map predictions. To address this concern, we propose a novel approach, namely \textbf{PerCMap}, which explicitly exploits clues from perspective-view features at both instance and point level. Specifically, at instance level, we propose Cross-view Instance Activation (CIA) to activate instance queries across surround-view images, thereby helping the model recover the instance attributes of map vectors. At point level, we design Dual-view Point Embedding (DPE), which fuses features from both views to generate input-aware positional embeddings and improve the accuracy of point coordinate estimation. Extensive experiments on \textit{nuScenes} and \textit{Argoverse 2} demonstrate that PerCMap achieves strong and consistent performance across benchmarks, reaching 67.1 and 70.5 mAP, respectively.

<title>UniRGB-IR: A Unified Framework for Visible-Infrared Semantic Tasks via Adapter Tuning</title>

Abstract: Semantic analysis on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images has gained significant attention due to their enhanced accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions including low-illumination and adverse weather. However, due to the lack of pre-trained foundation models on the large-scale infrared image datasets, existing methods prefer to design task-specific frameworks and directly fine-tune them with pre-trained foundation models on their RGB-IR semantic relevance datasets, which results in poor scalability and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniRGB-IR, a scalable and efficient framework for RGB-IR semantic tasks that introduces a novel adapter mechanism to effectively incorporate rich multi-modal features into pre-trained RGB-based foundation models. Our framework comprises three key components: a vision transformer (ViT) foundation model, a Multi-modal Feature Pool (MFP) module, and a Supplementary Feature Injector (SFI) module. The MFP and SFI modules cooperate with each other as an adpater to effectively complement the ViT features with the contextual multi-scale features. During training process, we freeze the entire foundation model to inherit prior knowledge and only optimize the MFP and SFI modules. Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of our framework, we utilize the ViT-Base as the pre-trained foundation model to perform extensive experiments. Experimental results on various RGB-IR semantic tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for image manipulation, yet interactive, localized editing workflows remain underdeveloped. We introduce Layered Diffusion Brushes (LDB), a novel training-free framework that enables interactive, layer-based editing using standard diffusion models. LDB defines each "layer" as a self-contained set of parameters guiding the generative process, enabling independent, non-destructive, and fine-grained prompt-guided edits, even in overlapping regions. LDB leverages a unique intermediate latent caching approach to reduce each edit to only a few denoising steps, achieving 140~ms per edit on consumer GPUs. An editor implementing LDB, incorporating familiar layer concepts, was evaluated via user study and quantitative metrics. Results demonstrate LDB's superior speed alongside comparable or improved image quality, background preservation, and edit fidelity relative to state-of-the-art methods across various sequential image manipulation tasks. The findings highlight LDB's ability to significantly enhance creative workflows by providing an intuitive and efficient approach to diffusion-based image editing and its potential for expansion into related subdomains, such as video editing.

<title>RATLIP: Generative Adversarial CLIP Text-to-Image Synthesis Based on Recurrent Affine Transformations</title>

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality photorealistic images with textual descriptions as a condition is very challenging. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the classical model for this task, frequently suffer from low consistency between image and text descriptions and insufficient richness in synthesized images. Recently, conditional affine transformations (CAT), such as conditional batch normalization and instance normalization, have been applied to different layers of GAN to control content synthesis in images. CAT is a multi-layer perceptron that independently predicts data based on batch statistics between neighboring layers, with global textual information unavailable to other layers. To address this issue, we first model CAT and a recurrent neural network (RAT) to ensure that different layers can access global information. We then introduce shuffle attention between RAT to mitigate the characteristic of information forgetting in recurrent neural networks. Moreover, both our generator and discriminator utilize the powerful pre-trained model, Clip, which has been extensively employed for establishing associations between text and images through the learning of multimodal representations in latent space. The discriminator utilizes CLIP's ability to comprehend complex scenes to accurately assess the quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the CUB, Oxford, and CelebA-tiny datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: When applying deep learning models in open-world scenarios, active learning (AL) strategies are crucial for identifying label candidates from a nearly infinite amount of unlabeled data. In this context, robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanisms are essential for handling data outside the target distribution of the application. However, current works investigate both problems separately. In this work, we introduce SISOM as the first unified solution for both AL and OOD detection. By leveraging feature space distance metrics SISOM combines the strengths of the currently independent tasks to solve both effectively. We conduct extensive experiments showing the problems arising when migrating between both tasks. In these evaluations SISOM underlined its effectiveness by achieving first place in two of the widely used OpenOOD benchmarks and second place in the remaining one. In AL, SISOM outperforms others and delivers top-1 performance in three benchmarks

<title>SMC++: Masked Learning of Unsupervised Video Semantic Compression</title>

Abstract: Most video compression methods focus on human visual perception, neglecting semantic preservation. This leads to severe semantic loss during the compression, hampering downstream video analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a Masked Video Modeling (MVM)-powered compression framework that particularly preserves video semantics, by jointly mining and compressing the semantics in a self-supervised manner. While MVM is proficient at learning generalizable semantics through the masked patch prediction task, it may also encode non-semantic information like trivial textural details, wasting bitcost and bringing semantic noises. To suppress this, we explicitly regularize the non-semantic entropy of the compressed video in the MVM token space. The proposed framework is instantiated as a simple Semantic-Mining-then-Compression (SMC) model. Furthermore, we extend SMC as an advanced SMC++ model from several aspects. First, we equip it with a masked motion prediction objective, leading to better temporal semantic learning ability. Second, we introduce a Transformer-based compression module, to improve the semantic compression efficacy. Considering that directly mining the complex redundancy among heterogeneous features in different coding stages is non-trivial, we introduce a compact blueprint semantic representation to align these features into a similar form, fully unleashing the power of the Transformer-based compression module. Extensive results demonstrate the proposed SMC and SMC++ models show remarkable superiority over previous traditional, learnable, and perceptual quality-oriented video codecs, on three video analysis tasks and seven datasets. \textit{Codes and model are available at: https://github.com/tianyuan168326/VideoSemanticCompression-Pytorch.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods typically overlook local manifold structures, leading to compromised discriminative capabilities in perceptual quality evaluation. To address this limitation, we present LML-IQA, an innovative no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) approach that leverages a combination of local manifold learning and contrastive learning. Our approach first extracts multiple patches from each image and identifies the most visually salient region. This salient patch serves as a positive sample for contrastive learning, while other patches from the same image are treated as intra-class negatives to preserve local distinctiveness. Patches from different images also act as inter-class negatives to enhance feature separation. Additionally, we introduce a mutual learning strategy to improve the model's ability to recognize and prioritize visually important regions. Comprehensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PLCC of 0.942 on TID2013 (compared to 0.908) and 0.977 on CSIQ (compared to 0.965).

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in open vocabulary computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation. Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

Abstract: We present LiDAR-GS, a Gaussian Splatting (GS) method for real-time, high-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR scans in public urban road scenes. Recent GS methods proposed for cameras have achieved significant advancements in real-time rendering beyond Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, applying GS representation to LiDAR, an active 3D sensor type, poses several challenges that must be addressed to preserve high accuracy and unique characteristics. Specifically, LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, using range-view representation for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations. Furthermore, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Representation, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident direction and external factors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances decomposition, LiDAR-GS succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets when compared with the methods using explicit mesh or implicit NeRF. Our source code is publicly available at https://www.github.com/cqf7419/LiDAR-GS.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel generative video compression framework that leverages motion pattern priors, derived from subtle dynamics in common scenes (e.g., swaying flowers or a boat drifting on water), rather than relying on video content priors (e.g., talking faces or human bodies). These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) aims to segment classes that are not present in the training dataset. However, most existing studies assume that the training data is fixed in advance, overlooking more practical scenarios where new datasets are continuously collected over time. To address this, we first analyze how existing OVS models perform under such conditions. In this context, we explore several approaches such as retraining, fine-tuning, and continual learning but find that each of them has clear limitations. To address these issues, we propose ConOVS, a novel continual learning method based on a Mixture-of-Experts framework. ConOVS dynamically combines expert decoders based on the probability that an input sample belongs to the distribution of each incremental dataset. Through extensive experiments, we show that ConOVS consistently outperforms existing methods across pre-training, incremental, and zero-shot test datasets, effectively expanding the recognition capabilities of OVS models when data is collected sequentially.

Abstract: Existing feedforward image-to-3D methods mainly rely on 2D multi-view diffusion models that cannot guarantee 3D consistency. These methods easily collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle object-centric cases. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object generation and scene reconstruction from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs. Plus, to improve the capability and generality of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments show that DiffusionGS yields improvements of 2.20 dB/23.25 and 1.34 dB/19.16 in PSNR/FID for objects and scenes than the state-of-the-art methods, without depth estimator. Plus, our method enjoys over 5$\times$ faster speed ($\sim$6s on an A100 GPU). Our Project page at https://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/DiffusionGS/ shows the video and interactive results.

Abstract: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in multimodal alignment and fusion within the field of machine learning, driven by the increasing availability and diversity of data modalities such as text, images, audio, and video. Unlike previous surveys that often focus on specific modalities or limited fusion strategies, our work presents a structure-centric and method-driven framework that emphasizes generalizable techniques. We systematically categorize and analyze key approaches to alignment and fusion through both structural perspectives -- data-level, feature-level, and output-level fusion -- and methodological paradigms -- including statistical, kernel-based, graphical, generative, contrastive, attention-based, and large language model (LLM)-based methods, drawing insights from an extensive review of over 260 relevant studies. Furthermore, this survey highlights critical challenges such as cross-modal misalignment, computational bottlenecks, data quality issues, and the modality gap, along with recent efforts to address them. Applications ranging from social media analysis and medical imaging to emotion recognition and embodied AI are explored to illustrate the real-world impact of robust multimodal systems. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing multimodal learning systems for improved scalability, robustness, and generalizability across diverse domains.

Abstract: Structuring latent representations in a hierarchical manner enables models to learn patterns at multiple levels of abstraction. However, most prevalent image understanding models focus on visual similarity, and learning visual hierarchies is relatively unexplored. In this work, for the first time, we introduce a learning paradigm that can encode user-defined multi-level complex visual hierarchies in hyperbolic space without requiring explicit hierarchical labels. As a concrete example, first, we define a part-based image hierarchy using object-level annotations within and across images. Then, we introduce an approach to enforce the hierarchy using contrastive loss with pairwise entailment metrics. Finally, we discuss new evaluation metrics to effectively measure hierarchical image retrieval. Encoding these complex relationships ensures that the learned representations capture semantic and structural information that transcends mere visual similarity. Experiments in part-based image retrieval show significant improvements in hierarchical retrieval tasks, demonstrating the capability of our model in capturing visual hierarchies.

Abstract: Condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic counterparts has demonstrated its promise for image classification. However, previous research has overlooked a crucial concern in image recognition: ensuring that models trained on condensed datasets are unbiased towards protected attributes (PA), such as gender and race. Our investigation reveals that dataset distillation fails to alleviate the unfairness towards minority groups within original datasets. Moreover, this bias typically worsens in the condensed datasets due to their smaller size. To bridge the research gap, we propose a novel fair dataset distillation (FDD) framework, namely FairDD, which can be seamlessly applied to diverse matching-based DD approaches (DDs), requiring no modifications to their original architectures. The key innovation of FairDD lies in synchronously matching synthetic datasets to PA-wise groups of original datasets, rather than indiscriminate alignment to the whole distributions in vanilla DDs, dominated by majority groups. This synchronized matching allows synthetic datasets to avoid collapsing into majority groups and bootstrap their balanced generation to all PA groups. Consequently, FairDD could effectively regularize vanilla DDs to favor biased generation toward minority groups while maintaining the accuracy of target attributes. Theoretical analyses and extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that FairDD significantly improves fairness compared to vanilla DDs, with a promising trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Its consistent superiority across diverse DDs, spanning Distribution and Gradient Matching, establishes it as a versatile FDD approach. Code is available at https://github.com/zqhang/FairDD.

Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a promising approach for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) of visual representations. However, the out-of-the-box performance of MIMs is typically inferior to competing approaches. Most users cannot afford fine-tuning due to the need for large amounts of data, high GPU consumption, and specialized user knowledge. Therefore, the practical use of MIM representations is limited. In this paper we ask what is the reason for the poor out-of-the-box performance of MIMs. Is it due to weaker features produced by MIM models, or is it due to suboptimal usage? Through detailed analysis, we show that attention in MIMs is spread almost uniformly over many patches, leading to ineffective aggregation by the [cls] token. Based on this insight, we propose Selective Aggregation to better capture the rich semantic information retained in patch tokens, which significantly improves the out-of-the-box performance of MIM.

Abstract: Recent advancements in view synthesis have significantly enhanced immersive experiences across various computer graphics and multimedia applications, including telepresence and entertainment. By enabling the generation of new perspectives from a single input view, view synthesis allows users to better perceive and interact with their environment. However, many state-of-the-art methods, while achieving high visual quality, face limitations in real-time performance, which makes them less suitable for live applications where low latency is critical. In this paper, we present a lightweight, position-aware network designed for real-time view synthesis from a single input image and a target camera pose. The proposed framework consists of a Position Aware Embedding, which efficiently maps positional information from the target pose to generate high dimensional feature maps. These feature maps, along with the input image, are fed into a Rendering Network that merges features from dual encoder branches to resolve both high and low level details, producing a realistic new view of the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior efficiency and visual quality compared to existing approaches, particularly in handling complex translational movements without explicit geometric operations like warping. This work marks a step toward enabling real-time live and interactive telepresence applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the mainstream approach for visual generation. However, these models typically suffer from sample inefficiency and high training costs. Consequently, methods for efficient finetuning, inference and personalization were quickly adopted by the community. However, training these models in the first place remains very costly. While several recent approaches - including masking, distillation, and architectural modifications - have been proposed to improve training efficiency, each of these methods comes with a tradeoff: they achieve enhanced performance at the expense of increased computational cost or vice versa. In contrast, this work aims to improve training efficiency as well as generative performance at the same time through routes that act as a transport mechanism for randomly selected tokens from early layers to deeper layers of the model. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models and achieves this without architectural modifications or additional parameters. Finally, we show that TREAD reduces computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard ImageNet-256 benchmark in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 14x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 37x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations. Furthermore, we achieve a competitive FID of 2.09 in a guided and 3.93 in an unguided setting, which improves upon the DiT, without architectural changes.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models face limitations in building extra-large scale outdoor scenes, primarily due to the lack of sufficiently large-scale and detailed datasets. In this paper, we present a extra-large fine-grained dataset with 10 billion points composed of 41,006 drone-captured high-resolution aerial images, covering 20 diverse and culturally significant scenes from worldwide locations such as Cambridge Uni main buildings, the Pyramids, and the Forbidden City Palace. Compared to existing datasets, ours offers significantly larger scale and higher detail, uniquely suited for fine-grained 3D applications. Each scene contains an accurate spatial layout and comprehensive structural information, supporting detailed 3D reconstruction tasks. By reconstructing environments using these detailed images, our dataset supports multiple applications, including outputs in the widely adopted COLMAP format, establishing a novel benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art large-scale Gaussian Splatting methods.The dataset's flexibility encourages innovations and supports model plug-ins, paving the way for future 3D breakthroughs. All datasets and code will be open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generative models, they are prone to adversarial attacks and inadvertently generate unsafe, unethical content. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lacks scalability, and/or compromises generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style) -- all during test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of $\mathbf{20.01\%}$ in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is $\mathbf{\sim5}$x faster than the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Customization of text-to-image models enables users to insert new concepts or objects and generate them in unseen settings. Existing methods either rely on comparatively expensive test-time optimization or train encoders on single-image datasets without multi-image supervision, which can limit image quality. We propose a simple approach to address these challenges. We first leverage existing text-to-image models and 3D datasets to create a high-quality Synthetic Customization Dataset (SynCD) consisting of multiple images of the same object in different lighting, backgrounds, and poses. Using this dataset, we train an encoder-based model that incorporates fine-grained visual details from reference images via a shared attention mechanism. Finally, we propose an inference technique that normalizes text and image guidance vectors to mitigate overexposure issues in sampled images. Through extensive experiments, we show that our encoder-based model, trained on SynCD, and with the proposed inference algorithm, improves upon existing encoder-based methods on standard customization benchmarks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation enhances the performance of compact student networks by transferring knowledge from more powerful teacher networks without introducing additional parameters. In the feature space, local regions within an individual global feature encode distinct yet interdependent semantic information. Previous feature-based distillation methods mainly emphasize global feature alignment while neglecting the decoupling of local regions within an individual global feature, which often results in semantic confusion and suboptimal performance. Moreover, conventional contrastive representation distillation suffers from low efficiency due to its reliance on a large memory buffer to store feature samples. To address these limitations, this work proposes MSDCRD, a model-agnostic distillation framework that systematically decouples global features into multi-scale local features and leverages the resulting semantically rich feature samples with tailored sample-wise and feature-wise contrastive losses. This design enables efficient distillation using only a single batch, eliminating the dependence on external memory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSDCRD achieves superior performance not only in homogeneous teacher-student settings but also in heterogeneous architectures where feature discrepancies are more pronounced, highlighting its strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Compressed video super-resolution (SR) aims to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from the corresponding low-resolution (LR) compressed videos. Recently, some compressed video SR methods attempt to exploit the spatio-temporal information in the frequency domain, showing great promise in super-resolution performance. However, these methods do not differentiate various frequency subbands spatially or capture the temporal frequency dynamics, potentially leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a deep frequency-based compressed video SR model (FCVSR) consisting of a motion-guided adaptive alignment (MGAA) network and a multi-frequency feature refinement (MFFR) module. Additionally, a frequency-aware contrastive loss is proposed for training FCVSR, in order to reconstruct finer spatial details. The proposed model has been evaluated on three public compressed video super-resolution datasets, with results demonstrating its effectiveness when compared to existing works in terms of super-resolution performance (up to a 0.14dB gain in PSNR over the second-best model) and complexity.

Abstract: Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has emerged as a strong base model in various pinhole imaging segmentation tasks. However, when applying it to $360^\circ$ domain, the significant field-of-view (FoV) gap between pinhole ($70^\circ \times 70^\circ$) and panoramic images ($180^\circ \times 360^\circ$) poses unique challenges. Two major concerns for this application includes 1) inevitable distortion and object deformation brought by the large FoV disparity between domains; 2) the lack of pixel-level semantic understanding that the original SAM2 cannot provide. To address these issues, we propose a novel OmniSAM framework, which makes the first attempt to apply SAM2 for panoramic semantic segmentation. Specifically, to bridge the first gap, OmniSAM first divides the panorama into sequences of patches. These patches are then treated as image sequences in similar manners as in video segmentation tasks. We then leverage the SAM2's memory mechanism to extract cross-patch correspondences that embeds the cross-FoV dependencies, improving feature continuity and the prediction consistency along mask boundaries. For the second gap, OmniSAM fine-tunes the pretrained image encoder and reutilize the mask decoder for semantic prediction. An FoV-based prototypical adaptation module with dynamic pseudo label update mechanism is also introduced to facilitate the alignment of memory and backbone features, thereby improving model generalization ability across different sizes of source models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniSAM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins, e.g., 79.06% (+10.22%) on SPin8-to-SPan8, 62.46% (+6.58%) on CS13-to-DP13.

Abstract: Blind video super-resolution (BVSR) is a low-level vision task which aims to generate high-resolution videos from low-resolution counterparts in unknown degradation scenarios. Existing approaches typically predict blur kernels that are spatially invariant in each video frame or even the entire video. These methods do not consider potential spatio-temporal varying degradations in videos, resulting in suboptimal BVSR performance. In this context, we propose a novel BVSR model based on Implicit Kernels, BVSR-IK, which constructs a multi-scale kernel dictionary parameterized by implicit neural representations. It also employs a newly designed recurrent Transformer to predict the coefficient weights for accurate filtering in both frame correction and feature alignment. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed BVSR-IK, when compared with four state-of-the-art BVSR models on three commonly used datasets, with BVSR-IK outperforming the second best approach, FMA-Net, by up to 0.59 dB in PSNR. Source code will be available at https://github.com/QZ1-boy/BVSR-IK.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in standard RGB image processing tasks. However, applying ViTs to multi-channel imaging (MCI) data, e.g., for medical and remote sensing applications, remains a challenge. In particular, MCI data often consist of layers acquired from different modalities. Directly training ViTs on such data can obscure complementary information and impair the performance. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective pretraining framework for large-scale MCI datasets. Our method, named Isolated Channel ViT (IC-ViT), patchifies image channels individually and thereby enables pretraining for multimodal multi-channel tasks. We show that this channel-wise patchifying is a key technique for MCI processing. More importantly, one can pretrain the IC-ViT on single channels and finetune it on downstream multi-channel datasets. This pretraining framework captures dependencies between patches as well as channels and produces robust feature representation. Experiments on various tasks and benchmarks, including JUMP-CP and CHAMMI for cell microscopy imaging, and So2Sat-LCZ42 for satellite imaging, show that the proposed IC-ViT delivers 4-14 percentage points of performance improvement over existing channel-adaptive approaches. Further, its efficient training makes it a suitable candidate for large-scale pretraining of foundation models on heterogeneous data. Our code is available at https://github.com/shermanlian/IC-ViT.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved notable performance in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing with various applications in both academia and industry. However, with recent advancements in DNNs and transformer models with a tremendous number of parameters, deploying these large models on edge devices causes serious issues such as high runtime and memory consumption. This is especially concerning with the recent large-scale foundation models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Large Language Models (LLMs). Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the prominent techniques proposed to address the aforementioned problems using a teacher-student architecture. More specifically, a lightweight student model is trained using additional knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model. In this work, a comprehensive survey of knowledge distillation methods is proposed. This includes reviewing KD from different aspects: distillation sources, distillation schemes, distillation algorithms, distillation by modalities, applications of distillation, and comparison among existing methods. In contrast to most existing surveys, which are either outdated or simply update former surveys, this work proposes a comprehensive survey with a new point of view and representation structure that categorizes and investigates the most recent methods in knowledge distillation. This survey considers various critically important subcategories, including KD for diffusion models, 3D inputs, foundational models, transformers, and LLMs. Furthermore, existing challenges in KD and possible future research directions are discussed.

<title>Free-Lunch Color-Texture Disentanglement for Stylized Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have transformed image generation, enabling significant progress in stylized generation using only a few style reference images. However, current diffusion-based methods struggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling multiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the first tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement in stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled style elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem. Our approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image embedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting Color-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference images. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely with the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to enhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the signal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that preserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring Transformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes Disentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable solution for stylized image generation. Experiments on images from the WikiArt and StyleDrop datasets demonstrate that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, SADis surpasses state-of-the-art stylization methods in the DisIG task.Code is released at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/.

Abstract: Many 3D tasks such as pose alignment, animation, motion transfer, and 3D reconstruction rely on establishing correspondences between 3D shapes. This challenge has recently been approached by pairwise matching of semantic features from pre-trained vision models. However, despite their power, these features struggle to differentiate instances of the same semantic class such as ``left hand'' versus ``right hand'' which leads to substantial mapping errors. To solve this, we learn a surface-aware embedding space that is robust to these ambiguities while facilitating shared mapping for an entire family of 3D shapes. Importantly, our approach is self-supervised and requires only a small number of unpaired training meshes to infer features for new possibly imperfect 3D shapes at test time. We achieve this by introducing a contrastive loss that preserves the semantic content of the features distilled from foundational models while disambiguating features located far apart on the shape's surface. We observe superior performance in correspondence matching benchmarks and enable downstream applications including 2D-to-3D and 3D-to-3D texture transfer, in-part segmentation, pose alignment, and motion transfer in low-data regimes. Unlike previous pairwise approaches, our solution constructs a joint embedding space, where both seen and unseen 3D shapes are implicitly aligned without further optimization.

Abstract: We propose L2T, an advancement of visual instruction tuning (VIT). While VIT equips Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) with promising multimodal capabilities, the current design choices for VIT often result in overfitting and shortcut learning, potentially degrading performance. This gap arises from an overemphasis on instruction-following abilities, while neglecting the proactive understanding of visual information. Inspired by this, L2T adopts a simple yet effective approach by incorporating the loss function into both the instruction and response sequences. It seamlessly expands the training data, and regularizes the MLLMs from overly relying on language priors. Based on this merit, L2T achieves a significant relative improvement of up to 9% on comprehensive multimodal benchmarks, requiring no additional training data and incurring negligible computational overhead. Surprisingly, L2T attains exceptional fundamental visual capabilities, yielding up to an 18% improvement in captioning performance, while simultaneously alleviating hallucination in MLLMs. Github code: https://github.com/Feng-Hong/L2T.

Abstract: Low signal-to-noise ratio videos -- such as those from underwater sonar, ultrasound, and microscopy -- pose significant challenges for computer vision models, particularly when paired clean imagery is unavailable. We present Spatiotemporal Augmentations and denoising in Video for Downstream Tasks (SAVeD), a novel self-supervised method that denoises low-SNR sensor videos using only raw noisy data. By leveraging distinctions between foreground and background motion and exaggerating objects with stronger motion signal, SAVeD enhances foreground object visibility and reduces background and camera noise without requiring clean video. SAVeD has a set of architectural optimizations that lead to faster throughput, training, and inference than existing deep learning methods. We also introduce a new denoising metric, FBD, which indicates foreground-background divergence for detection datasets without requiring clean imagery. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for classification, detection, tracking, and counting tasks, and it does so with fewer training resource requirements than existing deep-learning-based denoising methods.

Abstract: Advertisement videos serve as a rich and valuable source of purpose-driven information, encompassing high-quality visual, textual, and contextual cues designed to engage viewers. They are often more complex than general videos of similar duration due to their structured narratives and rapid scene transitions, posing significant challenges to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we introduce VideoAds, the first dataset tailored for benchmarking the performance of MLLMs on advertisement videos. VideoAds comprises well-curated advertisement videos with complex temporal structures, accompanied by \textbf{manually} annotated diverse questions across three core tasks: visual finding, video summary, and visual reasoning. We propose a quantitative measure to compare VideoAds against existing benchmarks in terms of video complexity. Through extensive experiments, we find that Qwen2.5-VL-72B, an opensource MLLM, achieves 73.35\% accuracy on VideoAds, outperforming GPT-4o (66.82\%) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (69.66\%); the two proprietary models especially fall behind the opensource model in video summarization and reasoning, but perform the best in visual finding. Notably, human experts easily achieve a remarkable accuracy of 94.27\%. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' temporal modeling capabilities and highlight VideoAds as a potentially pivotal benchmark for future research in understanding video that requires high FPS sampling. The dataset and evaluation code will be publicly available at https://videoadsbenchmark.netlify.app.

Abstract: Human infants rapidly develop visual reasoning skills from minimal input, suggesting that developmentally inspired pretraining could significantly enhance the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs). Although recent efforts have leveraged infant-inspired datasets like SAYCam, existing evaluation benchmarks remain misaligned--they are either too simplistic, narrowly scoped, or tailored for large-scale pretrained models. Additionally, training exclusively on infant data overlooks the broader, diverse input from which infants naturally learn. To address these limitations, we propose BabyVLM, a novel framework comprising comprehensive in-domain evaluation benchmarks and a synthetic training dataset created via child-directed transformations of existing datasets. We demonstrate that VLMs trained with our synthetic dataset achieve superior performance on BabyVLM tasks compared to models trained solely on SAYCam or general-purpose data of the SAYCam size. BabyVLM thus provides a robust, developmentally aligned evaluation tool and illustrates how compact models trained on carefully curated data can generalize effectively, opening pathways toward data-efficient vision-language learning paradigms.

Abstract: Conventional infrared and visible image fusion(IVIF) methods often assume high-quality inputs, neglecting real-world degradations such as low-light and noise, which limits their practical applicability. To address this, we propose a Degradation-Decoupled Fusion(DDFusion) framework, which achieves degradation decoupling and jointly models degradation suppression and image fusion in a unified manner. Specifically, the Degradation-Decoupled Optimization Network(DDON) performs degradation-specific decomposition to decouple inter-degradation and degradation-information components, followed by component-specific extraction paths for effective suppression of degradation and enhancement of informative features. The Interactive Local-Global Fusion Network (ILGFN) aggregates complementary features across multi-scale pathways and alleviates performance degradation caused by the decoupling between degradation optimization and image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDFusion achieves superior fusion performance under both clean and degraded conditions. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/DDFusion.

Abstract: Fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for infrared small target detection poses significant challenges due to severe domain shifts. Existing adaptation methods often incorporate handcrafted priors to bridge this gap, yet such designs limit generalization and scalability. We identify a fundamental texture bias in foundation models, which overly depend on local texture cues for target localization. To address this, we propose Ladder Shape-Biased Side-Tuning (LSP-ST), a novel approach that introduces a shape-aware inductive bias to facilitate effective adaptation beyond texture cues. In contrast to prior work that injects explicit edge or contour features, LSP-ST models shape as a global structural prior, integrating both boundaries and internal layouts. We design a Shape-Enhanced Large-Kernel Attention Module to hierarchically and implicitly capture structural information in a fully differentiable manner, without task-specific handcrafted guidance. A theoretical analysis grounded in matched filtering and backpropagation reveals the mechanism by which the proposed attention improves structure-aware learning. With only 4.72M learnable parameters, LSP-ST achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple infrared small target detection benchmarks. Furthermore, its strong generalization is validated across tasks such as mirror detection, shadow detection, and camouflaged object detection, while maintaining stable performance on texture-driven tasks like salient object detection, demonstrating that the introduced shape bias complements rather than competes with texture-based reasoning.

Traditional low-rank plus sparse models often fail to capture dynamic backgrounds and global spatial-temporal correlations, which results in background leakage or target loss. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-enhanced nonlocal similarity implicit neural representation (INR) framework to address these challenges. We first integrate motion estimation via optical flow to capture subtle target movements, and propose multi-frame fusion to enhance motion saliency. Second, we leverage nonlocal similarity to construct patch tensors with strong low-rank properties, and propose an innovative tensor decomposition-based INR model to represent the nonlocal patch tensor, effectively encoding both the nonlocal low-rankness and spatial-temporal correlations of background through continuous neural representations. An alternating direction method of multipliers is developed for the nonlocal INR model, which enjoys theoretical fixed-point convergence. Experimental results show that our approach robustly separates dim targets from complex infrared backgrounds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: We present ViDRiP-LLaVA, the first large multimodal model (LMM) in computational pathology that integrates three distinct image scenarios, including single patch images, automatically segmented pathology video clips, and manually segmented pathology videos. This integration closely mirrors the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, ViDRiP-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning. Central to our approach is the ViDRiP-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. ViDRiP-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning. Our code, data, and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/QuIIL/ViDRiP-LLaVA.

Abstract: Recognising expressive behaviours in face videos is a long-standing challenge in Affective Computing. Despite significant advancements in recent years, it still remains a challenge to build a robust and reliable system for naturalistic and in-the-wild facial expressive behaviour analysis in real time. This paper addresses two key challenges in building such a system: (1). The paucity of large-scale labelled facial affect video datasets with extensive coverage of the 2D emotion space, and (2). The difficulty of extracting facial video features that are discriminative, interpretable, robust, and computationally efficient. Toward addressing these challenges, this work introduces xTrace, a robust tool for facial expressive behaviour analysis and predicting continuous values of dimensional emotions, namely valence and arousal, from in-the-wild face videos. To address challenge (1), the proposed affect recognition model is trained on the largest facial affect video data set, containing $\sim$450k videos that cover most emotion zones in the dimensional emotion space, making xTrace highly versatile in analysing a wide spectrum of naturalistic expressive behaviours. To address challenge (2), xTrace uses facial affect descriptors that are not only explainable, but can also achieve a high degree of accuracy and robustness with low computational complexity. The key components of xTrace are benchmarked against three existing tools: MediaPipe, OpenFace, and Augsburg Affect Toolbox. On an in-the-wild benchmarking set composed of $\sim$50k videos, xTrace achieves 0.86 mean Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and on the SEWA test set it achieves 0.75 mean CCC, outperforming existing SOTA by $\sim$7.1\%.

Abstract: As Text-to-Image models continue to evolve, so does the risk of generating unsafe, copyrighted, or privacy-violating content. Existing safety interventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to inference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept removal, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or collateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE, a training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the weight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and highly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is the Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that identifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over token embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain. Intuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the undesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then applied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target concept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or iterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for spectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on their relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in only $2$ seconds. Benchmarking against prior approaches, CURE achieves a more efficient and thorough removal for targeted artistic styles, objects, identities, or explicit content, with minor damage to original generation ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming.

Abstract: Language-Guided object recognition in remote sensing imagery is crucial for large-scale mapping and automated data annotation. However, existing open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal, and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future research in developing versatile object recognition systems.

Abstract: While recent text-to-image (T2I) models show impressive capabilities in synthesizing images from brief descriptions, their performance significantly degrades when confronted with long, detail-intensive prompts required in professional applications. We present DetailMaster, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models' systematic abilities to handle extended textual inputs that contain complex compositional requirements. Our benchmark introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: Character Attributes, Structured Character Locations, Multi-Dimensional Scene Attributes, and Spatial/Interactive Relationships. The benchmark comprises long and detail-rich prompts averaging 284.89 tokens, with high quality validated by expert annotators. Evaluation on 7 general-purpose and 5 long-prompt-optimized T2I models reveals critical performance limitations: state-of-the-art models achieve merely $\sim$50\% accuracy in key dimensions like attribute binding and spatial reasoning, while all models showing progressive performance degradation as prompt length increases. Our analysis reveals fundamental limitations in compositional reasoning, demonstrating that current encoders flatten complex grammatical structures and that diffusion models suffer from attribute leakage under detail-intensive conditions. We open-source our dataset, data curation code, and evaluation tools to advance detail-rich T2I generation and enable applications previously hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent acceleration methods enhance the efficiency by exploiting the local sparsity of attention scores; yet they often struggle with accelerating the long-range computation. To address this problem, we propose VORTA, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants. VORTA achieves an end-to-end speedup $1.76\times$ without loss of quality on VBench. Furthermore, it can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as model caching and step distillation, reaching up to speedup $14.41\times$ with negligible performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the practicality of video diffusion transformers in real-world settings. Codes and weights are available at https://github.com/wenhao728/VORTA.

Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with stereo depth estimation in rapidly changing scenes. In contrast, bio-inspired spike cameras emit asynchronous events at microsecond-level resolution, providing an alternative sensing modality. However, existing methods lack specialized stereo algorithms and benchmarks tailored to the spike data. To address this gap, we propose SpikeStereoNet, a brain-inspired framework and the first to estimate stereo depth directly from raw spike streams. The model fuses raw spike streams from two viewpoints and iteratively refines depth estimation through a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) update module. To benchmark our approach, we introduce a large-scale synthetic spike stream dataset and a real-world stereo spike dataset with dense depth annotations. SpikeStereoNet outperforms existing methods on both datasets by leveraging spike streams' ability to capture subtle edges and intensity shifts in challenging regions such as textureless surfaces and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong data efficiency, maintaining high accuracy even with substantially reduced training data. The source code and datasets will be publicly available.

Abstract: Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, top-tier text-to-image (T2I) models still struggle to achieve precise spatial layout control, i.e. accurately generating entities with specified attributes and locations. Segmentation-mask-to-image (S2I) generation has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating pixel-level spatial guidance and regional text prompts. However, existing S2I methods fail to simultaneously ensure semantic consistency and shape consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Seg2Any, a novel S2I framework built upon advanced multimodal diffusion transformers (e.g. FLUX). First, to achieve both semantic and shape consistency, we decouple segmentation mask conditions into regional semantic and high-frequency shape components. The regional semantic condition is introduced by a Semantic Alignment Attention Mask, ensuring that generated entities adhere to their assigned text prompts. The high-frequency shape condition, representing entity boundaries, is encoded as an Entity Contour Map and then introduced as an additional modality via multi-modal attention to guide image spatial structure. Second, to prevent attribute leakage across entities in multi-entity scenarios, we introduce an Attribute Isolation Attention Mask mechanism, which constrains each entity's image tokens to attend exclusively to themselves during image self-attention. To support open-set S2I generation, we construct SACap-1M, a large-scale dataset containing 1 million images with 5.9 million segmented entities and detailed regional captions, along with a SACap-Eval benchmark for comprehensive S2I evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Seg2Any achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-set and closed-set S2I benchmarks, particularly in fine-grained spatial and attribute control of entities.

Abstract: Generating multiview-consistent $360^\circ$ ground-level scenes from satellite imagery is a challenging task with broad applications in simulation, autonomous navigation, and digital twin cities. Existing approaches primarily focus on synthesizing individual ground-view panoramas, often relying on auxiliary inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and struggle to produce multiview consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose SatDreamer360, a framework that generates geometrically consistent multi-view ground-level panoramas from a single satellite image, given a predefined pose trajectory. To address the large viewpoint discrepancy between ground and satellite images, we adopt a triplane representation to encode scene features and design a ray-based pixel attention mechanism that retrieves view-specific features from the triplane. To maintain multi-frame consistency, we introduce a panoramic epipolar-constrained attention module that aligns features across frames based on known relative poses. To support the evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for generating multi-view ground panoramas from a satellite image, by augmenting the original VIGOR dataset with more ground-view images and their pose annotations. Experiments show that SatDreamer360 outperforms existing methods in both satellite-to-ground alignment and multiview consistency.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in video understanding, most existing datasets are limited to Earth's gravitational conditions. However, microgravity alters human motion, interactions, and visual semantics, revealing a critical gap for real-world vision systems. This presents a challenge for domain-robust video understanding in safety-critical space applications. To address this, we introduce MicroG-4M, the first benchmark for spatio-temporal and semantic understanding of human activities in microgravity. Constructed from real-world space missions and cinematic simulations, the dataset includes 4,759 clips covering 50 actions, 1,238 context-rich captions, and over 7,000 question-answer pairs on astronaut activities and scene understanding. MicroG-4M supports three core tasks: fine-grained multi-label action recognition, temporal video captioning, and visual question answering, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both spatial localization and semantic reasoning in microgravity contexts. We establish baselines using state-of-the-art models. All data, annotations, and code are available at https://github.com/LEI-QI-233/HAR-in-Space.

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for single-image dehazing. We embed the atmospheric scattering model into a PDE featuring edge-preserving diffusion and a nonlocal operator to maintain both local details and global structures. A key innovation is an adaptive regularization mechanism guided by the dark channel prior, which adjusts smoothing strength based on haze density. The framework's mathematical well-posedness is rigorously established by proving the existence and uniqueness of its weak solution in $H_0^1(\Omega)$. An efficient, GPU-accelerated fixed-point solver is used for implementation. Experiments confirm our method achieves effective haze removal while preserving high image fidelity, offering a principled alternative to purely data-driven techniques.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance across multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, how vision information contributes to the model's decoding process remains under-explored, as reflected in frequent hallucinations. Through a series of analyses, we found that (i) vision tokens provide meaningful visual information even when hallucinations occur, and (ii) their semantics are encoded in the textual space and become explicit under appropriate vocabulary constraints. Building on these observations, we propose ReVisiT, a simple training-free decoding method that references vision tokens to guide text generation. Our approach leverages the semantic information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text token distribution. Specifically, ReVisiT dynamically selects the most relevant vision token at each decoding step via context-aware constrained divergence minimization, and using its constrained projection to refine the output distribution to better incorporate visual semantics. Across five benchmarks on recent LVLMs, ReVisiT consistently enhances visual grounding with minimal computational overhead, and achieves competitive or superior results to state-of-the-art decoding baselines while reducing computational cost by up to $2\times$.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise as zero-shot goal-conditioned value functions, but their frozen pre-trained representations limit generalization and temporal reasoning. We introduce VITA, a zero-shot value function learning method that enhances both capabilities via test-time adaptation. At inference, a lightweight adaptation module is updated via a gradient step on a meta-learned self-supervised loss, such that each test-time update improves value estimation. By updating sequentially over a trajectory, VITA encodes history into its parameters, addressing the temporal reasoning limitations. To mitigate shortcut learning, we propose a dissimilarity-based sampling strategy that selects semantically diverse segments of the trajectory during training. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks, VITA generalizes from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art zero-shot method using autoregressive VLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VITA's zero-shot value estimates can be utilized for reward shaping in offline reinforcement learning, resulting in multi-task policies on the Meta-World benchmark that exceed the performance of those trained with the simulation's fuzzy-logic dense rewards.

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a major source of injury in hospitals and long-term care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

<title>OmniVCus: Feedforward Subject-driven Video Customization with Multimodal Control Conditions</title>

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus, with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training subjects to activate more frame embeddings.

<title>LH2Face: Loss function for Hard High-quality Face</title>

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR) algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face). Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving 49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method by 2.37%.

<title>DeRIS: Decoupling Perception and Cognition for Enhanced Referring Image Segmentation through Loopback Synergy</title>

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its general applicability. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/DeRIS.

<title>Investigating VLM Hallucination from a Cognitive Psychology Perspective: A First Step Toward Interpretation with Intriguing Observations</title>

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or externally driven factors, and may have neglected the possibility that hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing VLMs' cognitive biases that lead to hallucinations, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency, and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: appeal to authority. To systematically analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark, we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.

<title>SenseShift6D: Multimodal RGB-D Benchmarking for Robust 6D Pose Estimation across Environment and Sensor Variations</title>

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation have achieved high performance on representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode-and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations-largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For five common household objects (spray, pringles, tincase, sandwich, and mouse), we acquire 166.4k RGB and 16.7k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset demonstrate that applying multimodal sensor control at test time yields substantial performance gains, achieving a 19.5 pp improvement on pretrained generalizable models. It also enhances robustness precisely where those models tend to fail. Moreover, even instance-level pose estimators, where train and test set share identical object and background, performance still varies under environmental and sensor change, demonstrating that test-time sensor control remains effective compared to costly expansions in the quantity and diversity of real-world training data, without any additional training. SenseShift6D extends the object pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments.

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS dataset will be released soon.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as the Gate Shift Module (GSM) or the Gate Shift Fuse to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal shifts and channel grouped spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short and long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that integrates seamlessly with diverse 2D backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis Australia dataset, the first PES benchmark for table tennis containing over 4,800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across four PES benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions, leading to inaccurate predictions. To address this, we introduce the first robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with environmental variability, occlusions, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes 20 corruption types based on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the HOI field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic and partial cues, thus dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene. Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance, achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5 of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods, our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing well across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. However, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have historically been rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with {S\textsuperscript{2}M\textsuperscript{2}}: a global matching architecture that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. {S\textsuperscript{2}M\textsuperscript{2}} establishes a new state of the art on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods in most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial objects and precise structural analysis. However, existing datasets for astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency, object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset containing 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community, STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view. Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR) model that could accurately infer the flux-consistent high-resolution images from input photometry, suppressing several SR state-of-the-art methods by 24.84% on a novel designed flux consistency metric, showing the priority of our method for astrophysics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and the value of our dataset. Code and models are available at https://github.com/GuoCheng12/STAR.

Abstract: Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU), which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry (IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by 10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional entropy model.

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in (1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

Abstract: Good form is the difference between strength and strain, yet for the fast-growing community of at-home fitness enthusiasts, expert feedback is often out of reach. FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.

<title>MRFD: Multi-Region Fusion Decoding with Self-Consistency for Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without requiring model updates.

<title>Error Propagation Mechanisms and Compensation Strategies for Quantized Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing existing PTQ methods. Specifically, it achieves a 1.2 PSNR improvement over SVDQuant on SDXL W4A4, while incurring only an additional $<$ 0.5\% time overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We first propose a holistic taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.

Abstract: Retrieving relevant visual and textual information from medical literature and hospital records can enhance diagnostic accuracy for clinical image interpretation. We develop a multimodal retrieval model jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG which doesn't backpropagate LVLM errors to the retriever. Using only general-purpose backbones with lightweight fine-tuning, our model achieves competitive results with medically-pretrained models on clinical classification and VQA tasks. In a novel analysis, we find that different top-retrieved images often yield different predictions for the same target, and that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition costs in training robust object detection models for complex industrial environments, such as offshore oil platforms. Data collection in these hazardous settings often limits the development of autonomous inspection systems. To mitigate this issue, we propose a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that integrates procedural rendering and AI-driven video generation. The approach uses BlenderProc to produce photorealistic images with domain randomization and NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 to generate physically consistent video sequences with temporal variation. A YOLO-based detector trained on a composite dataset, combining real and synthetic data, outperformed models trained solely on real images. A 1:1 ratio between real and synthetic samples achieved the highest accuracy. The results demonstrate that synthetic data generation is a viable, cost-effective, and safe strategy for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video-grounded chatbot systems and navigation robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To address this, we first build lightweight captioning models using a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluate their performance not only on single-sentence but on detailed captioning tasks. We obtain surprising results showing that our model can achieve performance comparable to MLLMs, suggesting its potential to serve as a strong captioning specialist for on-device applications. While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it suffers from occasional captioning errors. We investigate the underlying causes and observe that the problems stem from ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality by refining coarse descriptions into more precise captions. At its core, DeepLens improves visual grounding by re-examining the informative regions identified in the initial glance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model over both recent lightweight captioning methods and MLLMs in detailed captioning and even in long-range video QA tasks.

<title>Cryo-RL: automating prostate cancer cryoablation planning with reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases, Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent, limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones, highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1) Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior), which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than 20%.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.

EO tasks introduce unique challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning, change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps), which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in $\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data has be released.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms. Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However, most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU, Replica, and BlendedMVS datasets.

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

<title>GI-NAS: Boosting Gradient Inversion Attacks Through Adaptive Neural Architecture Search</title>

Abstract: Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach towards image authentication and tampering detection by using watermarking as a communication channel for semantic information. We modify the HiDDeN deep-learning watermarking architecture to embed and extract high-dimensional real vectors representing image captions. Our method improves significantly robustness on both malign and benign edits. We also introduce a local confidence metric correlated with Message Recovery Rate, enhancing the method's practical applicability. This approach bridges the gap between traditional watermarking and passive forensic methods, offering a robust solution for image integrity verification.

<title>Rethinking Medical Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI: An Image Quality Assessment Perspective</title>

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those leveraging autoencoders, have been widely adopted for anomaly detection task in brain MRI. Unlike most existing works try to improve the task accuracy through architectural or algorithmic innovations, we tackle this task from image quality assessment (IQA) perspective, an under-explored direction in the field. Due to the limitations of conventional metrics such as l1 in capturing the nuanced differences in reconstructed images for medical anomaly detection, we propose fusion quality, a novel metric that wisely integrates the structure-level sensitivity of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) with the pixel-level precision of l1. The metric offers a more comprehensive assessment of reconstruction quality, considering intensity (subtractive property of l1 and divisive property of SSIM), contrast, and structural similarity. Furthermore, the proposed metric makes subtle regional variations more impactful in the final assessment. Thus, considering the inherent divisive properties of SSIM, we design an average intensity ratio (AIR)-based data transformation that amplifies the divisive discrepancies between normal and abnormal regions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection. By fusing the aforementioned two components, we devise the IQA approach. Experimental results on two distinct brain MRI datasets show that our IQA approach significantly enhances medical anomaly detection performance when integrated with state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: With sepsis remaining a leading cause of mortality, early identification of patients with sepsis and those at high risk of death is a challenge of high socioeconomic importance. Given the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to monitor microcirculatory alterations, we propose a deep learning approach to automated sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction using a single HSI cube acquired within seconds. In a prospective observational study, we collected HSI data from the palms and fingers of more than 480 intensive care unit patients. Neural networks applied to HSI measurements predicted sepsis and mortality with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively. Performance improved substantially with additional clinical data, reaching AUROCs of 0.94 for sepsis and 0.83 for mortality. We conclude that deep learning-based HSI analysis enables rapid and noninvasive prediction of sepsis and mortality, with a potential clinical value for enhancing diagnosis and treatment.

arXiv:2411.14833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches rely heavily on detection or segmentation in each frame as a prerequisite, requiring substantial resources for high-quality segmentation masks and increasing the overall prediction time. To address these limitations, we propose CAP, a novel end-to-end one-stage framework that reimagines cell tracking by treating Cell as Point. Unlike traditional methods, CAP eliminates the need for explicit detection or segmentation, instead jointly tracking cells for sequences in one stage by leveraging the inherent correlations among their trajectories. This simplification reduces both labeling requirements and pipeline complexity. However, directly processing the entire sequence in one stage poses challenges related to data imbalance in capturing cell division events and long sequence inference. To solve these challenges, CAP introduces two key innovations: (1) adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling, which prioritizes cell division events to mitigate the occurrence imbalance of cell events, and (2) the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference strategy, which ensures continuous and stable tracking of newly emerging cells over extended sequences. By removing the dependency on segmentation-based preprocessing while addressing the challenges of imbalanced occurrence of cell events and long-sequence tracking, CAP demonstrates promising cell tracking performance and is 8 to 32 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and model checkpoints will be available soon.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks with task-specific fine-tuning, yet full parameter fine-tuning is often computationally prohibitive for large models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the \textbf{Server-Side Aggregation Bias}, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the \textbf{Client-Side Initialization Lag}, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness. We propose LoRA-FAIR, a novel method that tackles both issues by introducing a correction term on the server, enhancing aggregation efficiency and accuracy. LoRA-FAIR maintains computational and communication efficiency, yielding superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on ViT and MLP-Mixer models across large-scale datasets demonstrate that LoRA-FAIR consistently achieves performance improvements in FL settings.

Abstract: Real-time computer vision (CV) plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, whose performance is highly dependent on communication networks. Nonetheless, the data-oriented characteristics of conventional communications often do not align with the special needs of real-time CV tasks. To alleviate this issue, the recently emerged semantic communications only transmit task-related semantic information and exhibit a promising landscape to address this problem. However, the communication challenges associated with Semantic Facial Editing, one of the most important real-time CV applications on social media, still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing Editable-DeepSC, a novel cross-modal semantic communication approach for facial editing. Firstly, we theoretically discuss different transmission schemes that separately handle communications and editings, and emphasize the necessity of Joint Editing-Channel Coding (JECC) via iterative attributes matching, which integrates editings into the communication chain to preserve more semantic mutual information. To compactly represent the high-dimensional data, we leverage inversion methods via pre-trained StyleGAN priors for semantic coding. To tackle the dynamic channel noise conditions, we propose SNR-aware channel coding via model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments indicate that Editable-DeepSC can achieve superior editings while significantly saving the transmission bandwidth, even under high-resolution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.

Abstract: Many everyday mobile manipulation tasks require precise interaction with small objects, such as grasping a knob to open a cabinet or pressing a light switch. In this paper, we develop Servoing with Vision Models (SVM), a closed-loop framework that enables a mobile manipulator to tackle such precise tasks involving the manipulation of small objects. SVM uses state-of-the-art vision foundation models to generate 3D targets for visual servoing to enable diverse tasks in novel environments. Naively doing so fails because of occlusion by the end-effector. SVM mitigates this using vision models that out-paint the end-effector, thereby significantly enhancing target localization. We demonstrate that aided by out-painting methods, open-vocabulary object detectors can serve as a drop-in module for SVM to seek semantic targets (e.g. knobs) and point tracking methods can help SVM reliably pursue interaction sites indicated by user clicks. We conduct a large-scale evaluation spanning experiments in 10 novel environments across 6 buildings including 72 different object instances. SVM obtains a 71% zero-shot success rate on manipulating unseen objects in novel environments in the real world, outperforming an open-loop control method by an absolute 42% and an imitation learning baseline trained on 1000+ demonstrations also by an absolute success rate of 50%.

Abstract: We propose a demand estimation method that leverages unstructured text and image data to infer substitution patterns. Using pre-trained deep learning models, we extract embeddings from product images and textual descriptions and incorporate them into a random coefficients logit model. This approach enables researchers to estimate demand even when they lack data on product attributes or when consumers value hard-to-quantify attributes, such as visual design or functional benefits. Using data from a choice experiment, we show that our approach outperforms standard attribute-based models in counterfactual predictions of consumers' second choices. We also apply it across 40 product categories on Amazon and consistently find that text and image data help identify close substitutes within each category.

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a critical challenge due to the diversity in garment categories, geometries, and deformations. Despite this, humans can effortlessly handle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing research in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity, primarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment manipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment specifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation, which features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and refines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or training expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence to automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a single expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention. However, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of garments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve generalization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a Hierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies transferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then generates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive experiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate that HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing to previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and deformation where others fail.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has traditionally relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models. CNNs, however, are constrained by limited receptive fields, while Transformers face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. To over-come these issues, recent studies have explored alternative architectures. The Mamba model, a selective state-space design, achieves near-linear complexity and effectively captures long-range dependencies. Its vision-oriented variant, the Visual State Space (VSS) model, extends these strengths to image feature learning. In parallel, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhanc-es nonlinear expressiveness by replacing fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Moti-vated by these advances, we propose the VSS-Enhanced KAN (VKAN) module, which integrates VSS with the Expanded Field Convolutional KAN (EFC-KAN) as a replacement for Transformer modules, thereby strengthening feature extraction. We further embed VKAN into a U-Net frame-work, resulting in MedVKAN, an efficient medical image segmentation model. Extensive exper-iments on five public datasets demonstrate that MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second on the remaining one. These results underscore the effective-ness of combining Mamba and KAN while introducing a novel and computationally efficient feature extraction framework.

<title>Breaking the Compression Ceiling: Data-Free Pipeline for Ultra-Efficient Delta Compression</title>

Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned-pretrained paradigm, storing numerous fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance. UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions, using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3) Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression. Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B) with up to 50x compression, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base) with up to 224x compression, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 132x compression, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 18x compression, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression.

Abstract: Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models are available at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.

<title>Shifting AI Efficiency From Model-Centric to Data-Centric Compression</title>

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on scaling model parameters. However, as hardware limits constrain further model growth, the primary computational bottleneck has shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over increasingly long sequences by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient artificial intelligence (AI) is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position data-centric compression as the emerging paradigm, which improves AI efficiency by directly compressing the volume of data processed during model training or inference. To formalize this shift, we establish a unified framework for existing efficiency strategies and demonstrate why it constitutes a crucial paradigm change for long-context AI. We then systematically review the landscape of data-centric compression methods, analyzing their benefits across diverse scenarios. Finally, we outline key challenges and promising future research directions. Our work aims to provide a novel perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing efforts, and catalyze innovation to address the challenges posed by ever-increasing context lengths.

Abstract: Differentiable optics, as an emerging paradigm that jointly optimizes optics and (optional) image processing algorithms, has made innovative optical designs possible across a broad range of applications. Many of these systems utilize diffractive optical components (DOEs) for holography, PSF engineering, or wavefront shaping. Existing approaches have, however, mostly remained limited to laboratory prototypes, owing to a large quality gap between simulation and manufactured devices. We aim at lifting the fundamental technical barriers to the practical use of learned diffractive optical systems. To this end, we propose a fabrication-aware design pipeline for diffractive optics fabricated by direct-write grayscale lithography followed by nano-imprinting replication, which is directly suited for inexpensive mass production of large area designs. We propose a super-resolved neural lithography model that can accurately predict the 3D geometry generated by the fabrication process. This model can be seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable optics frameworks, enabling fabrication-aware, end-to-end optimization of computational optical systems. To tackle the computational challenges, we also devise tensor-parallel compute framework centered on distributing large-scale FFT computation across many GPUs. As such, we demonstrate large scale diffractive optics designs up to 32.16 mm $\times$ 21.44 mm, simulated on grids of up to 128,640 by 85,760 feature points. We find adequate agreement between simulation and fabricated prototypes for applications such as holography and PSF engineering. We also achieve high image quality from an imaging system comprised only of a single DOE, with images processed only by a Wiener filter utilizing the simulation PSF. We believe our findings lift the fabrication limitations for real-world applications of diffractive optics and differentiable optical design.

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities -- such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning -- within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) renders pixels by rasterizing Gaussian primitives, where conditional alpha-blending dominates the computational cost in the rendering pipeline. This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent universal module that expands the applicability of Tensor Core (TCU) for 3DGS, leading to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing top-tier acceleration algorithms and integrates seamlessly with rendering pipeline designs, such as Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thereby achieving a total acceleration of up to 5.6x.

<title>Tversky Neural Networks: Psychologically Plausible Deep Learning with Differentiable Tversky Similarity</title>

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception of similarity. In contrast, Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity with psychological plausibility based on a representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a function of their common and distinctive features. This model of similarity has not been used in deep learning before, in part because of the challenge of incorporating discrete set operations. In this paper, we develop a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive basic neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR. Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling neural networks, we show that the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear projection layer. For instance, on the NABirds image classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases by 7.8%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified interpretation of both types of projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes for which we also propose a novel visualization technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in modern deep learning, and designing neural networks that are interpretable under an established theory of psychological similarity.

<title>TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity</title>

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits. The code is available at: https://github.com/Suchenl/TAG-WM.

<title>The Illusion of Progress? A Critical Look at Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons between TTA methods and make it difficult to assess their practical strengths and weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning with vision-language models (VLMs) often suffers from hallucinations, as models tend to generate explanations after only a superficial inspection of the image. We present \textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a framework that enhances reasoning reliability through post-hoc verification of chain-of-thought outputs. Given a VLM-generated rationale, CoRGI decomposes it into step-wise statements, grounds each step in visual evidence, and filters or corrects unsupported claims before producing the final answer. Experiments on five challenging benchmark-VCR, ScienceQA, MMMU, MathVista, and HallusionBenc-demonstrate that CoRGI consistently improves both answer accuracy and explanation faithfulness across multiple VLM backbones, including Qwen-2.5VL, LLaVA-1.6, and Gemma3-12B. Beyond quantitative gains, qualitative analyses further illustrate how the verification process reduces hallucination and strengthens interpretability, suggesting that post-hoc visual grounding is a promising direction for building more trustworthy and transparent multimodal reasoning systems.

<title>Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. To address these issues, we propose CcGAN-AVAR, an enhanced CcGAN framework featuring (1) two novel components for handling data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism that dynamically adjusts vicinity size and a multi-task discriminator that enhances generator training through auxiliary regression and density ratio estimation - and (2) the GAN framework's native one-step generator, enable 30x-2000x faster inference than CCDM. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 256x256 resolution) across eleven challenging settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

<title>Audio Does Matter: Importance-Aware Multi-Granularity Fusion for Video Moment Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval. These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end, we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference. To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e., Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning framework designed to enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, with a focus on improving precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present \textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and innovation policy.

arXiv:2509.18111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.

arXiv:2509.23373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, visual token pruning, efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, HoloV, global visual context

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to the computational overhead caused by massive visual tokens. Existing token pruning methods focus on attention-first approaches, which may lead to a drop in performance at high pruning ratios. In response, the proposed HoloV framework offers a more holistic approach to visual token pruning. By distributing the pruning budget across spatial crops, HoloV ensures global visual context retention, minimizing information loss even with aggressive pruning. Experimental results show that HoloV outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios. For example, utilizing HoloV, LLaVA1.5 maintains 95.8% of original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens, striking a more efficient balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or [\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops, HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems. This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse 2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area, we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub, enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

Summary:
- Text-to-image diffusion models are powerful but prone to memorizing and replicating training data, leading to privacy and copyright issues.
- Memorization is attributed to attraction basins, prompting delays in applying classifier-free guidance (CFG).
- Delaying CFG application results in poorly aligned non-memorized images.
- The initial noise sample significantly influences escape times from attraction basins.
- Proposed mitigation strategies adjust initial noise samples to encourage earlier escape and reduce memorization while maintaining image-text alignment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However, such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

Summary: 
This study explores representation biases in AI-generated images in an occupational setting, comparing the performance of two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram. The research reveals that both tools tend to reinforce traditional gender stereotypes in the generated images. Over 750 AI-generated images of occupations were analyzed, with findings indicating the presence of biases in the visual representations. The study highlights the importance of addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases in AI visualisation tools to ensure diversity in media and professional contexts. The results underscore the risk of narrow representations perpetuated by AI image generators. Suggestions are provided for practitioners, individuals, and researchers to enhance gender representation in generated images, promoting inclusivity and equality. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used, addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over 750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations. In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners, individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images with visible genders.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

<div> Keywords: LiDAR point clouds, out-of-distribution detection, unsupervised learning, epistemic uncertainty, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

Summary: 
An unsupervised approach for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in LiDAR point clouds is introduced in this study. The method utilizes epistemic uncertainty derived from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters within the feature space of a deep neural network. By differentiating between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, the model effectively distinguishes OOD objects from ambiguous in-distribution regions. The approach does not require additional data or training stages, outperforming existing uncertainty-based methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Results show significant improvements, with an 18% increase in AUROC, a 22% rise in AUPRC, and a 36% reduction in FPR95 compared to previous predictive entropy-based approaches. This advancement in OOD detection is crucial for accurate scene understanding and preventing misclassifications of unknown objects. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC, 22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%), compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

<div> Keywords: Human Activity Recognition, Open-set classification, Hierarchical classifier, Unseen activities, Dataset

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach to Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier known as Hi-OSCAR. It addresses the challenge of handling unseen activities in HAR datasets by structuring activity classes into a hierarchy. Hi-OSCAR can accurately identify known activities while rejecting unknown ones, enabling open-set classification. The classifier also localizes unknown classes to the nearest internal node, providing additional insight. To support open-set HAR research, the authors have collected a new dataset called NFI_FARED, which includes data from multiple subjects performing nineteen activities across different contexts. The dataset is publicly available for download. This research aims to bridge the gap between the diverse range of activities performed in real life and the limitations of existing annotated sensor datasets used in training, ultimately improving the reliability and accuracy of HAR classifiers. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability. Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown" classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and available for download.

<div> Keywords: HFOs, biomarker, epilepsy, automated detection, S-transform<br />
Summary:<br />
High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a valuable biomarker for identifying the epileptogenic zone, and mapping HFO-generating regions can improve precision in epilepsy surgery. This study introduces a novel automated method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands using an unsupervised clustering technique with the S-transform. The method showed high sensitivity (97.67%), precision (98.57%), and F-score (97.78%) on controlled datasets and demonstrated a strong correlation with surgical outcomes in epilepsy patients. The results confirmed HFOs as promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity, with seizure freedom achieved by removing HFOs, particularly fast ripple, and seizure recurrence associated with remaining HFOs. Automated detection of HFOs is crucial for research and clinical applications, providing a more efficient and objective approach compared to manual visual identification, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes in epilepsy surgery. <br /> <div>

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined. Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500 Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity, and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients. Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

<div> Keywords: DINOv2, Linear Representation Hypothesis, SAEs, functional specialization, Minkowski Representation Hypothesis

Summary:
The study explores the nature of object recognition by deploying DINOv2 and using the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH). Through the analysis of downstream tasks, functional specialization is revealed, with classification utilizing "Elsewhere" concepts, segmentation relying on boundary detectors, and depth estimation drawing on various depth cues. The geometry and statistics of concepts learned by SAEs show dense representations evolving towards greater coherence. Tokens are found to be formed by combining convex mixtures of archetypes, suggesting a departure from linear sparsity alone. The proposed Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) posits that tokens are defined by convex mixtures of archetypes, grounded in conceptual spaces. Empirical signatures of MRH are examined, with implications for interpreting vision-transformer representations. <div>
arXiv:2510.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization: classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors' conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer representations.

Summary:
PhyDAE is a novel approach for remote sensing image restoration that addresses the challenges posed by complex and heterogeneous degradations. It utilizes a two-stage cascaded architecture to transform implicit degradation information into explicit decision signals, allowing for precise identification and differentiated processing of various degradation factors such as haze, noise, blur, and low-light conditions. The model incorporates degradation mining mechanisms like the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) to analyze degradation characteristics comprehensively. Physics-aware expert modules and sparse activation strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining imaging physics consistency. PhyDAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration tasks on benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance, reduced parameter count, and computational complexity. It strikes an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, making significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches. The code is available for implementation.

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts (PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals, enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives. Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video, leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility. Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M) samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful clinical AI.

<div> Keywords: camera-centric multimodal model, spatial intelligence, vision-language, spatial generation, Puffin-4M dataset

Summary: 
Puffin is a unified camera-centric multimodal model designed to enhance spatial awareness and generation by integrating language regression and diffusion-based generation. By treating the camera as language, Puffin aligns visual cues with photographic terminology and reasons across geometric contexts. Trained on the Puffin-4M dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets, Puffin incorporates global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps for flexible spatial generation. Experimental results show Puffin outperforms specialized models for camera-centric generation and understanding. Through instruction tuning, Puffin is able to generalize to various cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and photography guidance. The researchers plan to release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and benchmark to further advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets. We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps, yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

<div> transfer learning, Structured Output Regularization (SOR), few-shot medical imaging classification, convolutional filters, group lasso, $L_1 penalties 

Summary:
Structured Output Regularization (SOR) is proposed as a framework for transfer learning that freezes internal network structures while incorporating group lasso and $L_1 penalties. This approach allows models to adapt to domain-specific features with minimal additional parameters and can be applied to various network components. In three few-shot medical imaging classification tasks, SOR yielded competitive results using DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks. SOR offers a computationally efficient solution that mitigates overfitting and enhances the model's ability to learn from limited data, making it a valuable tool for transfer learning tasks in medical imaging. <div>

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization (SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks.

<div> benchmark, embodied capabilities, multimodal large language models, BEAR, BEAR-Agent

Summary:
The article introduces a new benchmark called BEAR that evaluates the embodied capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across various domains. BEAR consists of tasks ranging from low-level pointing to high-level planning, covering 14 domains in 6 categories. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs on BEAR reveals persistent limitations in their embodied capabilities. To address these limitations, the authors propose BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that enhances MLLM performance by integrating pretrained vision models. This approach leads to a substantial improvement in MLLM performance on BEAR, with a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. The experiments also suggest that enhancing MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit tasks in simulated environments. The findings underscore the importance of evaluating and improving the embodied capabilities of MLLMs for better performance on a wide range of tasks.

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across 14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

<div> Keywords: adversarial attacks, deep learning models, biological mechanisms, reinforcement learning, ImageNet dataset

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel defense framework inspired by biological mechanisms to enhance the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks. The proposed approach incorporates foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in to selectively capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses using reinforcement learning-guided saccades. By integrating these glimpses into a reconstructed image before classification, the method effectively mitigates adversarial noise and maintains semantic integrity without the need for retraining downstream classifiers. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the framework's ability to improve system robustness across various classifiers and attack types while reducing training overhead compared to existing defense techniques. This innovative approach shows promise for enhancing the security of deep learning models in real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces LinearSR, a framework for Image Super-Resolution that utilizes Linear Attention to overcome the computational bottleneck of self-attention models. The authors developed an Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning strategy to address training instability issues and implemented a Mixture of Experts architecture to balance perception-distortion trade-offs. They also introduced a guidance paradigm called TAG based on precision-over-volume principles. The resulting LinearSR model achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency, featuring a diffusion forward pass with SOTA-level speed. This work paves the way for using Linear Attention in photorealistic SR applications, setting a foundation for future research in efficient generative super-resolution.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful, yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time, systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF) strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our "precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future research in efficient generative super-resolution.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification, however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a} re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and conservation biology.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content (AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video, highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems. Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts, showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models.

Summary:
The framework proposed in this study addresses challenges in Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) through three key contributions. Firstly, a unified solution for aligning heterogeneous modalities across multiple levels and stages is introduced, utilizing contrastive learning and optimal transport theory. Secondly, a hard negative mining method with soft labels is implemented to enhance multi-modality alignments and discrimination of hard negative pairs. Lastly, a Gated Cross-Attention Module is developed to integrate answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and select relevant information.

arXiv:2510.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions. Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP) have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels, modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces SkipSR, a framework for accelerating video super-resolution by identifying low-detail regions from low-resolution inputs and skipping computation on them. By only super-resolving areas that require refinement, SkipSR significantly reduces computation while maintaining perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models. The method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency on 720p videos without any perceived loss in quality. This approach allows for scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos by focusing computational resources on areas that benefit from refinement, rather than processing all pixels uniformly. Video demos of SkipSR's performance are available for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks.

<div> Keywords: 3D instance segmentation, open-vocabulary, knowledge distillation, ScanNet200, Replica

Summary:
Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation aims to classify instances beyond annotated labels by avoiding the use of 2D mappings that introduce noise and slow down inference. The Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided Knowledge distillation (FOLK) introduces a teacher model to distill open-vocabulary knowledge into a 3D student model, enabling direct instance classification from 3D point clouds. A 2D CLIP embedding is generated by the teacher model for each 3D instance, serving as the distillation target. A 3D student model produces 3D embeddings for instances, and label-guided distillation is used to transfer knowledge from 2D embeddings to the student model. FOLK outperforms existing methods on the ScanNet200 dataset with an AP50 score of 35.7 and achieves significantly faster inference speeds. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, with all codes to be released post-acceptance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from 2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled 3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

<div> Keywords: cranberry farming, change monitoring, deep learning, vision transformers, self-supervised approach

Summary:
This article introduces a method for change monitoring in cranberry farming using deep learning techniques. Traditional manual monitoring methods are time-consuming, so the proposed method aims to automate the process using vision transformers (ViTs) and a self-supervised approach. By fine-tuning ViTs with a two-fold pretext task, the method learns a latent space for the evolution of plant and fruit appearance over time. This allows for the prediction of growth and the distinction of temporal differences among cranberry varieties. A new time-lapse dataset of cranberry fruit, featuring eight varieties observed 52 times over four months, is provided, annotated with relevant information. The approach is generalizable to other crops and applications and the code and dataset are available on GitHub for further exploration.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield, and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually, requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task (time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github. com/ronan-39/tlt/).

<div> hierarchical structure, compositionality, vision-language models, hyperbolic space, multi-modal representation learning

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of current vision-language models in expressing both hierarchical structures within concept families and compositional relationships across different concept families. To address this challenge, the authors propose PHyCLIP, a model that utilizes an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic factors. This design allows for the emergence of intra-family hierarchies within individual factors and captures cross-family compositionality through the $\ell_1$-product metric. Experimental results demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches in tasks such as zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding. Additionally, PHyCLIP offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing complex semantic relationships in multi-modal representation learning. <div>
arXiv:2510.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family (e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP, which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the $\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.

<div> transfer attack, segmentation models, adversarial examples, SegTrans, computational efficiency

Summary:<br />
Researchers have developed a novel transfer attack framework, SegTrans, to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples in segmentation models. The framework divides input samples into local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples, which are used for perturbation optimization. Unlike existing methods, SegTrans focuses on retaining local semantic information rather than global semantic information for perturbation optimization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and segmentation models demonstrate that SegTrans significantly improves transfer attack success rates and computational efficiency. It achieves an average increase of 8.55% in transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by over 100% compared to current state-of-the-art methods. <div>

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than 100%.

<div> image restoration, knowledge distillation, defense, adaptive singular value perturbation, deep learning <br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a defense mechanism, Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), designed specifically for image restoration models to counter knowledge distillation attacks. ASVP disrupts the alignment needed for distillation by injecting structured, high-frequency perturbations into the internal feature maps of the teacher model using singular value decomposition. This method hinders student learning while maintaining the quality of the teacher's output. Experimental results across various image restoration tasks, including super-resolution and dehazing, demonstrate that ASVP can significantly reduce the student's PSNR and SSIM metrics without affecting the teacher's performance. Compared to existing methods, ASVP provides a more robust and consistent defense against knowledge distillation attacks, offering a practical solution to safeguard open-source restoration models from unauthorized model replication. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient, as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks: super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation.

<br />
Summary:
An object-focused data augmentation framework is proposed for animal health monitoring in data-constrained settings. The framework segments animals from backgrounds and augments them using transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to improve animal detection and monitoring performance. This strategy addresses the limited data availability and scene-specific challenges faced in aerial drone-based animal health monitoring. Initial experiments show that the augmented dataset outperforms baseline models in animal detection. By generating domain-specific data, this approach enables real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios. This method bridges the gap between limited data and practical applicability, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of agricultural operations using integrated monitoring systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small, occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds, environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios, bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

<div> Perception-Time Scaling, visual estimation tasks, LVLMs, inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning  
Summary:  
The article introduces DisTANCE, a benchmark for visual estimation tasks, revealing limited precision in current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inference-time scaling strategies offer only marginal benefits due to the one-shot output nature of LVLMs' visual understanding. To address this, Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) is proposed, encouraging token-rich perception and breaking down complex perception tasks into manageable sub-problems. PTS, combined with reinforcement learning, significantly improves perception accuracy, enhancing high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7% and demonstrating generalizability to various tasks. Remarkably, synthetic PTS data combined with math reasoning data show gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Analysis reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and enhances model attention to image tokens. The code and data for this research will be publicly available.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%, and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

<div> mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals, weak reflections, joint descriptors, activity recognition
<br />
<br />
In the paper, the authors propose a framework called mmJoints to enhance the output of a pre-trained mmWave-based 3D pose estimator by including joint descriptors that estimate the likelihood of joint sensing and the reliability of predicted joint locations. This approach aims to address the issue of models relying too heavily on statistical priors rather than sensor data. Through extensive evaluations across various pose estimation settings, the authors demonstrate that mmJoints can estimate joint descriptors with a low error rate and improve joint position accuracy by up to 12.5%. Furthermore, they show that using mmJoints can boost activity recognition accuracy by up to 16% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework not only enhances interpretability but also improves performance in downstream tasks, making it a promising approach for mmWave-based pose estimation.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations, over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below 4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications. However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval - HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment. Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel hand quality assessment task aimed at improving details in text-to-image models, particularly focusing on human hands. The HandPair dataset is created to train models for assessing hand quality, using high- and low-quality hand pairs for efficient supervision. The HandEval model is designed to evaluate hand quality by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and prior knowledge of hand keypoints. It outperforms existing methods in aligning with human judgments. The model is integrated into image generation and artificial image generation and curation (AIGC) detection pipelines, enhancing generated hand realism and detection accuracy. This work highlights the importance of assessing quality in specific regions of generated images, providing a valuable tool for improving visual fidelity in complex local regions. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Summary: 
The article introduces a defensive paradigm called Uncolorable Examples to prevent unauthorized colorization of grayscale images, which can lead to copyright infringement. The method, Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), embeds imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. Four criteria - effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness - are established to ensure the real-world applicability of the method. PAChroma optimizes imperceptible perturbations with a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality and applies diverse input transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models and robustness against common post-processing. Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets show that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This research is a crucial step towards protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization and opens up avenues for copyright-aware defenses in generative media. <br /> <div>

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Summary:
The article introduces Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2) as a framework to improve the efficiency of autoregressive text-to-image models. This new method incorporates denoising into Jacobi iterations, allowing for parallel token generation in models. By predicting next clean tokens through fine-tuning with noise-perturbed token embeddings, the denoising paradigm guides the model towards more stable trajectories. During inference, SJD2 initializes token sequences with Gaussian noise and iteratively predicts next clean tokens in the embedding space. A probabilistic criterion is used to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, refining unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that SJD2 can accelerate image generation by reducing model forward passes while maintaining high visual quality in the generated images.

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory. Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

<div> Keywords: Large vision-language models, object hallucination, epistemic uncertainty, adversarial perturbations, mitigation strategy

Summary:
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have seen success but face challenges such as object hallucination, where descriptions of non-existent objects are generated. The study suggests that uncertain visual tokens in the vision encoder (VE) contribute to hallucinations. High epistemic uncertainty in visual tokens correlates with hallucinations. Visual tokens in early VE layers showing large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high uncertainty. A simple strategy is proposed to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE. The method efficiently identifies uncertain visual tokens using adversarial perturbations and masks them during the self-attention process in middle VE layers to reduce their influence on visual encoding and alleviate hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can complement existing methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE) with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.

Dynamic temperature control based on spatial entropy improves content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural coherence in autoregressive image generation models without additional computational cost. Entropy-informed acceptance rules in speculative decoding enable near-lossless generation at 85% of the inference cost compared to conventional methods.

arXiv:2510.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive (AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution. Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed. Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding, achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation quality and sampling speed.

Summary:
The paper introduces the task of Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) to address the challenges of noisy annotations in LiDAR data. Existing noisy-label learning strategies from image classification are adapted to 3D segmentation, but they prove ineffective. A novel dual-view framework called DuNe is proposed, with strong and weak branches to enforce feature-level consistency and apply confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% label noise. Overall, the approach demonstrates robustness in domain generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation tasks. The code for the proposed approach is available on the project page.

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data. We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is available on our project page.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817 patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models. Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse medical image translation tasks.

<div> Framework, Microelectrode implantation, Anomaly detection, Vision transformer, Image analysis

Summary:
The paper presents an image-based anomaly detection framework for flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into the brain cortex. The framework utilizes microscopic cameras in a robotic FME implantation system to monitor the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point. By extracting regions of interest (ROIs) from raw images and inputting them into a pretrained vision transformer (ViT), anomalies can be detected at different checkpoints. A progressive granularity patch feature sampling method is employed to address sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issues, optimizing performance at various locations. Additionally, a selection of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios enhances descriptors for each specific scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is confirmed through validation with image datasets from the implantation system. <div>

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point, respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image datasets collected from our implantation system.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces MambaH-Fit, a framework for accurate normal estimation in point clouds using state space modelling. Existing methods often struggle with fine geometric details, affecting normal prediction accuracy. The proposed Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion scheme enhances geometric context learning in local point cloud neighborhoods by adaptively fusing multi-scale features. The Patch-wise State Space Model represents point cloud patches as hyper-surfaces through state dynamics, improving fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's superior accuracy, robustness, and flexibility over existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the proposed components. <div>

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However, existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework to improve multi-object tracking (MOT) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By incorporating a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module, motion and appearance features are jointly modeled to enhance small-target detection. The global-local collaborative detection strategy helps in accurately tracking small-scale targets in complex backgrounds. The JPTrack tracking algorithm is also introduced to address issues like ID switches and trajectory fragmentation, thus improving the continuity and stability of MOT.

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT) technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However, complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

<div> Transformer, parameter compression, Mixture of Experts, structured sparsification, text-to-image generation

Summary: 
In this study, the authors introduce a method called Dense2MoE to address the issue of large parameter size and inference overhead in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for text-to-image generation. By transforming a dense DiT into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, the number of activated parameters is reduced while maintaining model capacity. The Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks are replaced with MoE layers, resulting in a 62.5% reduction in activated parameters. Additionally, the Mixture of Blocks (MoB) approach is proposed to selectively activate DiT blocks for further sparsity enhancement. A multi-step distillation pipeline is designed for effective conversion, incorporating expert initialization, knowledge distillation, and group feature loss for MoB optimization. The Dense2MoE transformation of large diffusion transformers achieves a 60% reduction in activated parameters without sacrificing performance, surpassing pruning-based methods in experiments. This advancement establishes a more efficient paradigm for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g., FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\% while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features. This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set, achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical diagnostics.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a new data synthesis pipeline called SOS, which utilizes an object-centric composition strategy to generate high-quality synthetic object segments. This approach involves pasting these segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting to create accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Training models on 100,000 synthetic images from SOS outperformed models trained on larger real-image datasets in detection and grounding tasks. By augmenting real datasets like LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments, significant performance improvements were achieved, particularly in low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios. The controllability of SOS also allows for targeted data generation for difficult intra-class referring in visual grounding tasks, further showcasing the flexibility and effectiveness of synthetic data in improving model generalization and performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K) on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4 $N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in visual grounding.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies, present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Summary: 
PSepT (Polar Separable Transform) is introduced as a separable orthogonal transform that addresses the limitations of traditional methods in computer vision. By utilizing a tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, PSepT achieves complete kernel factorization and enables independent radial and angular processing. This design significantly reduces computational complexity to O(N^2 log N), memory requirements to O(N^2), and condition number scaling to O(√N). PSepT demonstrates orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance properties, along with improved numerical stability and computational efficiency. Experimental results show competitive classification performance on structured datasets while maintaining exact reconstruction. The separable framework of PSepT opens up new possibilities for high-order moment analysis in image analysis applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$ complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis applications.

Summary:
training feature attribution is explored in this work for deep neural networks to provide insights into model workings. This approach links test predictions to specific regions of training images, offering fine-grained, test-specific explanations. It identifies harmful examples driving misclassifications and exposes spurious correlations like patch-based shortcuts that other attribution methods may miss. By studying both input features and influential training examples together, a better understanding of model behavior is achieved. This method enhances the trust and accountability of deep learning models by shedding light on their inner workings. <div>
arXiv:2510.09135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features (e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution methods fail to expose.

Video bronchoscopy is a crucial procedure in respiratory medicine, but navigating the bronchial tree can be complex. Surgeons often rely on CT scans and additional sensors for guidance. This article introduces an image-based topological localization pipeline for navigation assistance during bronchoscopy, eliminating the need for patient CT scans. The approach, trained on phantom data, shows strong generalization capabilities and outperforms existing methods, particularly on real data test sequences.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities. The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test sequences.

Summary: 
Instance-level recognition (ILR) is crucial for identifying individual objects accurately. However, creating large-scale annotated datasets for ILR is challenging. This research introduces a novel approach that generates diverse object instances synthetically without using real images. By fine-tuning vision models on the generated data, significant improvements were achieved in retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks covering multiple domains. This method addresses ILR-specific challenges efficiently and effectively, offering a new paradigm where only target domain names are required as input. The approach eliminates the need for extensive data collection and curation, making ILR more applicable in real-world scenarios across various domains. <div>

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09173</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption, limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model, achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health, productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6 dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking, standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows. Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding, drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

<title>3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer</title>

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the 3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements. Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

<title>Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting (e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions (e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks, including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

<title>Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are further classified based on their scope: single-task models, multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and their open-source implementations at https://github.com/ChaudharyUPES/A-comprehensive-review-on-Multi-weather-restoration

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis), are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field.

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods. Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image perturbations.

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500 images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across 706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and 63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues, while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated \texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP), which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at: https://github.com/Dmmm1997/MomentSeg

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks, VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models, with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales. Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study, we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4 million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

<title>CapGeo: A Caption-Assisted Approach to Geometric Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency, which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling. Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over 4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline (RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable, energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G networks. We release the code at \href{https://github.com/Hxxxz0/RadioFlow}{GitHub}.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2, ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at https://github.com/Zhangwenyao1/Hybrid-depth.

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods, while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully supervised methods in some scenarios.

<title>Enhancing Infrared Vision: Progressive Prompt Fusion Network and Benchmark</title>

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details, but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a notable 8.76\% improvement.

<title>Boosting Multi-modal Keyphrase Prediction with Dynamic Chain-of-Thought in Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs. Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the "overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

<title>BLINK-Twice: You see, but do you observe? A Reasoning Benchmark on Visual Perception</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09361</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress, particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models. BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/PicoTrex/BLINK-Twice

<title>Visibility-Aware Densification for 3D Gaussian Splatting in Dynamic Urban Scenes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09364</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09364</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically, achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring. While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM) into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

<title>Utilizing dynamic sparsity on pretrained DETR</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge, especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification (SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers without full model retraining.

arXiv:2510.09438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor, a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally, targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

arXiv:2510.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast, and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images. Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP) of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/SilvaScenes.

arXiv:2510.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters, thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and highlighting the potential of our method.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust, generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However, inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g. SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification. We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

arXiv:2510.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations, where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements, but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp (ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD, and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics, requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however, extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING (FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications - including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing - show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at http://schardong.github.io/flowing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic, multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic, parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision. Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across 26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally, extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench, demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However, training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement), which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

<title>StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96.

<title>Look before Transcription: End-to-End SlideASR with Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with domain-specific terminology, especially in specialized settings such as academic lectures. To address this, we define the SlideASR task, which leverages the rich visual information from presentation slides to improve transcription accuracy. Existing pipeline methods for this task tend to be complex and underperform. Although omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) provide a promising end-to-end framework, they frequently fail in practice by degenerating into simple optical character recognition (OCR) systems. To overcome this, we propose Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a novel post-training method designed to control the model's reasoning process. Drawing on the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, VAPO enforces a structured "Look before Transcription" procedure using a  format. Specifically, the model first performs OCR on the slide content within the think step, then generates the transcription by referencing this recognized visual information in the answer step. This reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement learning with four distinct rewards targeting format compliance, OCR accuracy, ASR quality, and visual anchoring consistency. To support further research, we construct SlideASR-Bench, a new entity-rich benchmark consisting of a synthetic dataset for training and testing, and a challenging real-world set for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPO significantly improves recognition of domain-specific terms, establishing an effective end-to-end paradigm for SlideASR.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT) reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels, and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.

Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation. However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming, computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates. The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%, leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369, with primitive parameter files approximately 6KB in size. Our approach is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping of simple models.

<title>FreqCa: Accelerating Diffusion Models via Frequency-Aware Caching</title>

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps. Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images, exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF) instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing. Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on GitHub.

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons. Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon, SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making. However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links, and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

<title>The Boundaries of Fair AI in Medical Image Prognosis: A Causal Perspective</title>

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE, the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE) prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts, underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for more robust, equitable prognostic models.

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream. Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of neural tuning.

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Abstract: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization, impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods. The code is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Evidence-U-KAN-BBE8}{github}.

Abstract: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers enhanced spatial resolution and tissue contrast that enables the detection of subtle pathological changes in neurological disorders. However, the limited availability of 7T scanners restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead. RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1) Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP) module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2 to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500 samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably, Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation. Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints, approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically, across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Abstract: We introduce MMAudioSep, a generative model for video/text-queried sound separation that is founded on a pretrained video-to-audio model. By leveraging knowledge about the relationship between video/text and audio learned through a pretrained audio generative model, we can train the model more efficiently, i.e., the model does not need to be trained from scratch. We evaluate the performance of MMAudioSep by comparing it to existing separation models, including models based on both deterministic and generative approaches, and find it is superior to the baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even after acquiring functionality for sound separation via fine-tuning, the model retains the ability for original video-to-audio generation. This highlights the potential of foundational sound generation models to be adopted for sound-related downstream tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/sony/mmaudiosep.

<title>Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at https://goba-attack.github.io/.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects, motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work, we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point. Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer. By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast, accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI segmentation across the lifespan.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence. Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust, interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting supports numerous clinical and research applications. We introduce the first generative model that conditions on voxel-level, continuous tumor concentrations to synthesize high-fidelity brain tumor MRIs. For the BraTS 2025 Inpainting Challenge, we adapt this architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5, and for tumor inpainting, we achieve 17.4. Our code is available at: https://github.com/valentin-biller/ldm.git

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication. However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies: Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn exchanges in code generation.

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' - the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions. ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2, we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts. Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon, planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in the ever more challenging environments.

<title>STaTS: Structure-Aware Temporal Sequence Summarization via Statistical Window Merging</title>

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness, and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+ datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30 archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity, demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware time series modeling.

<title>Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM-based Fusion</title>

Abstract: State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.

Abstract: Improving model robustness in case of corrupted images is among the key challenges to enable robust vision systems on smart devices, such as robotic agents. Particularly, robust test-time performance is imperative for most of the applications. This paper presents a novel approach to improve robustness of any classification model, especially on severely corrupted images. Our method (FROST) employs high-frequency features to detect input image corruption type, and select layer-wise feature normalization statistics. FROST provides the state-of-the-art results for different models and datasets, outperforming competitors on ImageNet-C by up to 37.1% relative gain, improving baseline of 40.9% mCE on severe corruptions.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes while overcoming catastrophic forgetting. The introduction of pre-trained models has brought new tuning paradigms to CIL. In this paper, we revisit different parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods within the context of continual learning. We observe that adapter tuning demonstrates superiority over prompt-based methods, even without parameter expansion in each learning session. Motivated by this, we propose incrementally tuning the shared adapter without imposing parameter update constraints, enhancing the learning capacity of the backbone. Additionally, we employ feature sampling from stored prototypes to retrain a unified classifier, further improving its performance. We estimate the semantic shift of old prototypes without access to past samples and update stored prototypes session by session. Our proposed method eliminates model expansion and avoids retaining any image samples. It surpasses previous pre-trained model-based CIL methods and demonstrates remarkable continual learning capabilities. Experimental results on five CIL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Abstract: Echocardiography is an essential medical technique for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, but its high operational complexity has led to a shortage of trained professionals. To address this issue, we introduce a novel probe movement guidance algorithm that has the potential to be applied in guiding robotic systems or novices with probe pose adjustment for high-quality standard plane image acquisition.Cardiac ultrasound faces two major challenges: (1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2) significant individual variations. Previous works have only learned the population-averaged structure of the heart rather than personalized cardiac structures, leading to a performance bottleneck. Clinically, we observe that sonographers dynamically adjust their interpretation of a patient's cardiac anatomy based on prior scanning sequences, consequently refining their scanning strategies. Inspired by this, we propose a novel sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training method. Specifically, our approach learns personalized three-dimensional cardiac structural features by predicting the masked-out image features and probe movement actions in a scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can predict the missing content it has acquired a good understanding of personalized cardiac structure. Extensive experiments on a large-scale expert scanning dataset with 1.67 million samples demonstrate that our proposed sequence-aware paradigm can effectively reduce probe guidance errors compared to other advanced baseline methods.

Abstract: Vision-based perception and reasoning is essential for scene understanding in any autonomous system. RGB and depth images are commonly used to capture both the semantic and geometric features of the environment. Developing methods to reliably interpret this data is critical for real-world applications, where noisy measurements are often unavoidable. In this work, we introduce a diffusion-based framework to address the RGB-D semantic segmentation problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that utilizing a Deformable Attention Transformer as the encoder to extract features from depth images effectively captures the characteristics of invalid regions in depth measurements. Our generative framework shows a greater capacity to model the underlying distribution of RGB-D images, achieving robust performance in challenging scenarios with significantly less training time compared to discriminative methods. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves State-of-the-Art performance on both the NYUv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets in general and especially in the most challenging of their image data.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generative approach for pose-free (without camera parameters) reconstruction of 360 scenes from a sparse set of 2D images. Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, pose-free observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of large complex scenes (with high degree of foreground and background detail) with known camera poses using view-conditioned generative priors, these methods cannot be directly adapted for the pose-free setting when ground-truth poses are not available during evaluation. To address this, we propose an image-to-image generative model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We introduce context and geometry conditioning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation layers as a lightweight alternative to cross-attention and also propose a novel confidence measure for 3D Gaussian splat representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent 3D representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 and DL3DV-10K benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed (precomputed camera parameters are given) reconstruction methods in complex 360 scenes. Our project page provides additional results, videos, and code.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-vision generation excel in visual fidelity but struggle with compositional generalization and semantic alignment. Existing datasets are noisy and weakly compositional, limiting models' understanding of complex scenes, while scalable solutions for dense, high-quality annotations remain a challenge. We introduce Generate Any Scene, a data engine that systematically enumerates scene graphs representing the combinatorial array of possible visual scenes. Generate Any Scene dynamically constructs scene graphs of varying complexity from a structured taxonomy of objects, attributes, and relations. Given a sampled scene graph, Generate Any Scene translates it into a caption for text-to-image or text-to-video generation; it also translates it into a set of visual question answers that allow automatic evaluation and reward modeling of semantic alignment. Using Generate Any Scene, we first design a self-improving framework where models iteratively enhance their performance using generated data. Stable Diffusion v1.5 achieves an average 4% improvement over baselines and surpassing fine-tuning on CC3M. Second, we also design a distillation algorithm to transfer specific strengths from proprietary models to their open-source counterparts. Using fewer than 800 synthetic captions, we fine-tune Stable Diffusion v1.5 and achieve a 10% increase in TIFA score on compositional and hard concept generation. Third, we create a reward model to align model generation with semantic accuracy at a low cost. Using GRPO algorithm, we fine-tune SimpleAR-0.5B-SFT and surpass CLIP-based methods by +5% on DPG-Bench. Finally, we apply these ideas to the downstream task of content moderation where we train models to identify challenging cases by learning from synthetic data.

Abstract: Most of the ML datasets we use today are biased. When we train models on these biased datasets, they often not only learn dataset biases but can also amplify them -- a phenomenon known as bias amplification. Several co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed to measure bias amplification between a protected attribute A (e.g., gender) and a task T (e.g., cooking). However, these metrics fail to measure biases when A is balanced with T. To measure bias amplification in balanced datasets, recent work proposed a predictability-based metric called leakage amplification. However, leakage amplification cannot identify the direction in which biases are amplified. In this work, we propose a new predictability-based metric called directional predictability amplification (DPA). DPA measures directional bias amplification, even for balanced datasets. Unlike leakage amplification, DPA is easier to interpret and less sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). Our experiments on tabular and image datasets show that DPA is an effective metric for measuring directional bias amplification. The code will be available soon.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel architecture for interactive segmentation in winter sports contexts. The field of interactive segmentation deals with the prediction of high-quality segmentation masks by informing the network about the objects position with the help of user guidance. In our case the guidance consists of click prompts. For this task, we first present a baseline architecture which is specifically geared towards quickly responding after each click. Afterwards, we motivate and describe a number of architectural modifications which improve the performance when tasked with segmenting winter sports equipment on the WSESeg dataset. With regards to the average NoC@85 metric on the WSESeg classes, we outperform SAM and HQ-SAM by 2.336 and 7.946 clicks, respectively. When applied to the HQSeg-44k dataset, our system delivers state-of-the-art results with a NoC@90 of 6.00 and NoC@95 of 9.89. In addition to that, we test our model on a novel dataset containing masks for humans during skiing.

Abstract: The widespread use of chest X-rays (CXRs), coupled with a shortage of radiologists, has driven growing interest in automated CXR analysis and AI-assisted reporting. While existing vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in specific tasks such as report generation or abnormality detection, they often lack support for interactive diagnostic capabilities. In this work we present RadVLM, a compact, multitask conversational foundation model designed for CXR interpretation. To this end, we curate a large-scale instruction dataset comprising over 1 million image-instruction pairs containing both single-turn tasks -- such as report generation, abnormality classification, and visual grounding -- and multi-turn, multi-task conversational interactions. After fine-tuning RadVLM on this instruction dataset, we evaluate it across different tasks along with re-implemented baseline VLMs. Our results show that RadVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in conversational capabilities and visual grounding while remaining competitive in other radiology tasks. Ablation studies further highlight the benefit of joint training across multiple tasks, particularly for scenarios with limited annotated data. Together, these findings highlight the potential of RadVLM as a clinically relevant AI assistant, providing structured CXR interpretation and conversational capabilities to support more effective and accessible diagnostic workflows.

Abstract: This work introduces Semantically Masked Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (SQ-GAN), a novel approach integrating semantically driven image coding and vector quantization to optimize image compression for semantic/task-oriented communications. The method only acts on source coding and is fully compliant with legacy systems. The semantics is extracted from the image computing its semantic segmentation map using off-the-shelf software. A new specifically developed semantic-conditioned adaptive mask module (SAMM) selectively encodes semantically relevant features of the image. The relevance of the different semantic classes is task-specific, and it is incorporated in the training phase by introducing appropriate weights in the loss function. SQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art image compression schemes such as JPEG2000, BPG, and deep-learning based methods across multiple metrics, including perceptual quality and semantic segmentation accuracy on the reconstructed image, at extremely low compression rates.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models with custom data leads to numerous expert models on specific tasks. Merging models into one universal model to empower multi-task ability refraining from data leakage has gained popularity. With the expansion in data and model size, parameter-efficient tuning becomes the common practice for obtaining task-specific models efficiently. However, few methods are dedicated to efficient merging, and existing methods designed for full fine-tuning merging fail under efficient merging. To address the issue, we analyze from low-rank decomposition and reveal that direction robustness during merging is crucial for merging efficient modules. We furthermore uncover that compensating for the gap between stark singular values contributes to direction robustness. Therefore, we propose RobustMerge, a training-free parameter-efficient merging method with complementary parameter adaptation to maintain direction robustness. Specifically, we (1) prune parameters and scale coefficients from inter-parameter relation for singular values to maintain direction stability away from task interference, and (2) perform cross-task normalization to enhance unseen task generalization. We establish a benchmark consisting of diverse multimodal tasks, on which we conduct experiments to certify the outstanding performance and generalizability of our method. Additional studies and extensive analyses further showcase the effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/AuroraZengfh/RobustMerge.

Abstract: When we train models on biased ML datasets, they not only learn these biases but can inflate them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. To measure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias amplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these metrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they cannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in captions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in Captioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it has limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified, poorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy, and is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional Predictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional bias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias using an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker models. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the most reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that generates implicit labels by learning underlined patterns and extracting discriminative features from unlabeled data without manual labelling. Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.

<title>CQ-DINO: Mitigating Gradient Dilution via Category Queries for Vast Vocabulary Object Detection</title>

Abstract: With the exponential growth of data, traditional object detection methods are increasingly struggling to handle vast vocabulary object detection tasks effectively. We analyze two key limitations of classification-based detectors: positive gradient dilution, where rare positive categories receive insufficient learning signals, and hard negative gradient dilution, where discriminative gradients are overwhelmed by numerous easy negatives. To address these challenges, we propose CQ-DINO, a category query-based object detection framework that reformulates classification as a contrastive task between object queries and learnable category queries. Our method introduces image-guided query selection, which reduces the negative space by adaptively retrieving top-K relevant categories per image via cross-attention, thereby rebalancing gradient distributions and facilitating implicit hard example mining. Furthermore, CQ-DINO flexibly integrates explicit hierarchical category relationships in structured datasets (e.g., V3Det) or learns implicit category correlations via self-attention in generic datasets (e.g., COCO). Experiments demonstrate that CQ-DINO achieves superior performance on the challenging V3Det benchmark (surpassing previous methods by 2.1% AP) while maintaining competitiveness in COCO. Our work provides a scalable solution for real-world detection systems requiring wide category coverage. The code is publicly at https://github.com/FireRedTeam/CQ-DINO.

Abstract: Open-world egocentric activity recognition poses a fundamental challenge due to its unconstrained nature, requiring models to infer unseen activities from an expansive, partially observed search space. We introduce ProbRes, a Probabilistic Residual search framework based on jump-diffusion that efficiently navigates this space by balancing prior-guided exploration with likelihood-driven exploitation. Our approach integrates structured commonsense priors to construct a semantically coherent search space, adaptively refines predictions using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a stochastic search mechanism to locate high-likelihood activity labels while minimizing exhaustive enumeration efficiently. We systematically evaluate ProbRes across multiple openness levels (L0-L3), demonstrating its adaptability to increasing search space complexity. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets (GTEA Gaze, GTEA Gaze+, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charades-Ego), we establish a clear taxonomy for open-world recognition, delineating the challenges and methodological advancements necessary for egocentric activity understanding. Our results highlight the importance of structured search strategies, paving the way for scalable and efficient open-world activity recognition.

Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) has become essential in numerous applications including healthcare, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction. However, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present significant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional anonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data utility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied naively. In this work, we present the first comprehensive framework for differentially private 2D human pose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance, we adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace. Next, we incorporate Feature Differential Privacy(FDP) to selectively privatize only sensitive features while retaining public visual cues. Finally, we propose a hybrid feature-projective DP framework that combines both approaches to balance privacy and accuracy for HPE. We evaluate our approach on the MPII dataset across varying privacy budgets, training strategies, and clipping norms. Our combined feature-projective method consistently outperforms vanilla DP-SGD and individual baselines, achieving up to 82.61\% mean PCKh@0.5 at $\epsilon = 0.8$, substantially closing the gap to the non-private performance. This work lays foundation for privacy-preserving human pose estimation in real-world, sensitive applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically extract visual features from the final layers of a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT). This widespread deep-layer bias, however, is largely driven by empirical convention rather than principled analysis. While prior studies suggest that different ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, the impact of this variation on MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of visual layer selection for MLLMs, analyzing representation similarity across ViT layers to establish shallow, middle, and deep layer groupings. Through extensive evaluation of MLLMs (1.4B-7B parameters) across 10 benchmarks encompassing 60+ tasks, we find that while deep layers excel in semantic-rich tasks like OCR, shallow and middle layers significantly outperform them on fine-grained visual tasks including counting, positioning, and object localization. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight feature fusion method that strategically incorporates shallower layers, achieving consistent improvements over both single-layer and specialized fusion baselines. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, showing that MLLMs can often see better when they look shallower.

Abstract: Video event detection has become a cornerstone of modern sports analytics, powering automated performance evaluation, content generation, and tactical decision-making. Recent advances in deep learning have driven progress in related tasks such as Temporal Action Localization (TAL), which detects extended action segments; Action Spotting (AS), which identifies a representative timestamp; and Precise Event Spotting (PES), which pinpoints the exact frame of an event. Although closely connected, their subtle differences often blur the boundaries between them, leading to confusion in both research and practical applications. Furthermore, prior surveys either address generic video event detection or broader sports video tasks, but largely overlook the unique temporal granularity and domain-specific challenges of event spotting. In addition, most existing sports video surveys focus on elite-level competitions while neglecting the wider community of everyday practitioners. This survey addresses these gaps by: (i) clearly delineating TAL, AS, and PES and their respective use cases; (ii) introducing a structured taxonomy of state of the art approaches including temporal modeling strategies, multimodal frameworks, and data-efficient pipelines tailored for AS and PES; and (iii) critically assessing benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols, highlighting limitations such as reliance on broadcast quality footage and metrics that over reward permissive multilabel predictions. By synthesizing current research and exposing open challenges, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for developing temporally precise, generalizable, and practically deployable sports event detection systems for both the research and industry communities.

Abstract: Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action recognition.

Abstract: Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens. Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for camera simulation, enabling both geometric transformations and realistic optical effects. Among these, image-based bokeh rendering has shown promising results, but diffusion for video bokeh remains unexplored. Existing image-based methods are plagued by temporal flickering and inconsistent blur transitions, while current video editing methods lack explicit control over the focus plane and bokeh intensity. These issues limit their applicability for controllable video bokeh. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion framework for generating temporally coherent, depth-aware video bokeh rendering. The framework employs a multi-plane image (MPI) representation adapted to the focal plane to condition the video diffusion model, thereby enabling it to exploit strong 3D priors from pretrained backbones. To further enhance temporal stability, depth robustness, and detail preservation, we introduce a progressive training strategy. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate superior temporal coherence, spatial accuracy, and controllability, outperforming prior baselines. This work represents the first dedicated diffusion framework for video bokeh generation, establishing a new baseline for temporally coherent and controllable depth-of-field effects.

Abstract: A major breakthrough in 3D reconstruction is the feedforward paradigm to generate pixel-wise 3D points or Gaussian primitives from sparse, unposed images. To further incorporate semantics while avoiding the significant memory and storage costs of high-dimensional semantic features, existing methods extend this paradigm by associating each primitive with a compressed semantic feature vector. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) the naively compressed feature compromises expressiveness, affecting the model's ability to capture fine-grained semantics, and (b) the pixel-wise primitive prediction introduces redundancy in overlapping areas, causing unnecessary memory overhead. To this end, we introduce \textbf{SpatialSplat}, a feedforward framework that produces redundancy-aware Gaussians and capitalizes on a dual-field semantic representation. Particularly, with the insight that primitives within the same instance exhibit high semantic consistency, we decompose the semantic representation into a coarse feature field that encodes uncompressed semantics with minimal primitives, and a fine-grained yet low-dimensional feature field that captures detailed inter-instance relationships. Moreover, we propose a selective Gaussian mechanism, which retains only essential Gaussians in the scene, effectively eliminating redundant primitives. Our proposed Spatialsplat learns accurate semantic information and detailed instances prior with more compact 3D Gaussians, making semantic 3D reconstruction more applicable. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method, demonstrating a remarkable 60\% reduction in scene representation parameters while achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to generate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic text-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these models should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but that approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key obstacles: (i) the data likelihood term is usually intractable; (ii) learned generative models cannot be directly conditioned on the distorted observations, leading to conflicting objectives between data likelihood and prior; and (iii) the reconstructions can deviate from the observed data. We present FLAIR, a novel, training-free variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as prior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective for flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it with deterministic trajectory adjustments to guide the prior towards regions which are more likely under the posterior. To enforce exact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the data fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent calibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated according to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion- and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been applied as a post-training technique for text-to-video diffusion models. To obtain training data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.

Abstract: Finding reliable matches is essential in multi-object tracking to ensure the accuracy and reliability of perception systems in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. Effective matching mitigates perception errors, enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on previous ones. However, this process is challenged by the bidirectional dependencies inherent in conventional image tokenizations, which creates a fundamental misalignment with the unidirectional nature of autoregressive models. To resolve this, we introduce AliTok, a novel Aligned Tokenizer that alters the dependency structure of the token sequence. AliTok employs a bidirectional encoder constrained by a causal decoder, a design that compels the encoder to produce a token sequence with both semantic richness and forward-dependency. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing a two-stage tokenizer training process to enhance reconstruction performance, AliTok achieves high fidelity and predictability simultaneously. Building upon AliTok, a standard decoder-only autoregressive model with just 177M parameters achieves a gFID of 1.44 and an IS of 319.5 on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. Scaling up to 662M parameters, our model reaches a gFID of 1.28, surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method while achieving a 10x faster sampling speed. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/ali-vilab/alitok.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies. The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF) module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention. To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark.

<title>Event-RGB Fusion for Spacecraft Pose Estimation Under Harsh Lighting</title>

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations, such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure, blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However, event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support community research on this topic, our dataset has been released publicly.

<title>Site-Level Fine-Tuning with Progressive Layer Freezing: Towards Robust Prediction of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia from Day-1 Chest Radiographs in Extremely Preterm Infants</title>

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses. Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR) models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering, enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales, resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales.

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing, and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features. Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold. We further evaluate our approach on the CAESAR and ISL Pointing datasets.

<title>UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, a unified framework that adapts CLIP for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Although CLIP excels at understanding, it lacks reconstruction abilities required to be a unified visual encoder. However, previous CLIP-based unified methods fail to balance understanding and reconstruction, leading to semantic degradation or inconsistent reconstructions. In contrast, we introduce a novel two-stage training scheme with a self-distillation strategy that progressively endows CLIP with high-fidelity reconstruction abilities while preserving its original comprehension performance. For enhanced reasoning and consistency in generation and editing, we further develop a dual-condition architecture built upon the MetaQuery framework. Our architecture jointly utilizes multimodal hidden states for rich contextual details and learnable query embeddings to harness the powerful reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging advanced image representation and architectural design, UniLIP demonstrates superior instruction following and edit fidelity. With only 1B and 3B parameters, UniLIP can outperform larger unified models such as BAGEL (7B) and Uniworld-V1 (12B), achieving state-of-the-art performance of 0.90 on GenEval, 0.63 on WISE, and 3.94 on ImgEdit. These results demonstrate that UniLIP successfully expands the application of CLIP, establishing its continuous features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated, with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for classification. The code is available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MedCAL-Bench.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) due to a critical adaptation gap: they lack the local inductive biases required for dense prediction and employ inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method proposes a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass. This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data. For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework towards existing work. Project page at: https://panolam.github.io/.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Abstract: The pursuit of unified multimodal models (UMMs) has long been hindered by a fundamental schism between multimodal understanding and generation. Current approaches typically disentangle the two and treat them as separate endeavors with disjoint objectives, missing the mutual benefits. We argue that true unification requires more than just merging two tasks. It requires a unified, foundational objective that intrinsically links them. In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder lens, i.e., regarding understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. To implement this, we propose UAE, where we begin by pre-training the decoder with the proposed 700k long-context image-caption pairs to direct it to "understand" the fine-grained and complex semantics from the text. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL) to unify the two, which covers two complementary stages: (1) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual perception; (2) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity. Our empirical results suggest that understanding can largely enhance generation (verified on GenEval), while generation, in turn, notably strengthens fine-grained visual perception like small object and color recognition (verified on MMT-Bench). This bidirectional improvement reveals a deep synergy: under the unified reconstruction objective, generation and understanding can mutually benefit each other, moving closer to truly unified multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce LaV-CoT, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to ~9.5% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by ~2.6%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information (multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining strategy. The implementation is made available.

Abstract: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

<title>Enhancing Feature Fusion of U-like Networks with Dynamic Skip Connections</title>

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like networks.

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment. In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images, thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual prompts, contributing to the development of more ethical AI applications in social media.

This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable, exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses, with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for evidence anchored defenses.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image. However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content manipulation across frames.

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem, Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description. Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new challenging problem.

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.

Abstract: Using pre-trained models has been found to reduce the effect of data heterogeneity and speed up federated learning algorithms. Recent works have explored training-free methods using first- and second-order statistics to aggregate local client data distributions at the server and achieve high performance without any training. In this work, we propose a training-free method based on an unbiased estimator of class covariance matrices which only uses first-order statistics in the form of class means communicated by clients to the server. We show how these estimated class covariances can be used to initialize the global classifier, thus exploiting the covariances without actually sharing them. We also show that using only within-class covariances results in a better classifier initialization. Our approach improves performance in the range of 4-26% with exactly the same communication cost when compared to methods sharing only class means and achieves performance competitive or superior to methods sharing second-order statistics with dramatically less communication overhead. The proposed method is much more communication-efficient than federated prompt-tuning methods and still outperforms them. Finally, using our method to initialize classifiers and then performing federated fine-tuning or linear probing again yields better performance.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has been studied mainly in either discrete or continuous settings, with little attention to dynamic, crowded environments. We present HA-VLN 2.0, a unified benchmark introducing explicit social-awareness constraints. Our contributions are: (i) a standardized task and metrics capturing both goal accuracy and personal-space adherence; (ii) HAPS 2.0 dataset and simulators modeling multi-human interactions, outdoor contexts, and finer language-motion alignment; (iii) benchmarks on 16,844 socially grounded instructions, revealing sharp performance drops of leading agents under human dynamics and partial observability; and (iv) real-world robot experiments validating sim-to-real transfer, with an open leaderboard enabling transparent comparison. Results show that explicit social modeling improves navigation robustness and reduces collisions, underscoring the necessity of human-centric approaches. By releasing datasets, simulators, baselines, and protocols, HA-VLN 2.0 provides a strong foundation for safe, socially responsible navigation research.

Abstract: Decoding sensory experiences from neural activity to reconstruct human-perceived visual stimuli and semantic content remains a challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Despite notable progress in current brain decoding models, a critical gap still persists in their systematic integration with established neuroscientific theories and the exploration of underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we present a novel framework that directly decodes fMRI signals into textual descriptions of viewed natural images. Our novel deep learning model, trained without visual information, achieves state-of-the-art semantic decoding performance, generating meaningful captions that capture the core semantic content of complex scenes. Neuroanatomical analysis reveals the critical role of higher-level visual cortices, including MT+ complex, ventral stream visual cortex, and inferior parietal cortex, in visual semantic processing. Furthermore, category-specific analysis demonstrates nuanced neural representations for semantic dimensions like animacy and motion. This work provides a more direct and interpretable framework to the brain's semantic decoding, offering a powerful new methodology for probing the neural basis of complex semantic processing, refining the understanding of the distributed semantic network, and potentially developing brain-sinpired language models.

Abstract: Animation retargetting applies sparse motion description (e.g., keypoint sequences) to a character mesh to produce a semantically plausible and temporally coherent full-body mesh sequence. Existing approaches come with restrictions -- they require access to template-based shape priors or artist-designed deformation rigs, suffer from limited generalization to unseen motion and/or shapes, or exhibit motion jitter. We propose Self-supervised Motion Fields (SMF), a self-supervised framework that is trained with only sparse motion representations, without requiring dataset-specific annotations, templates, or rigs. At the heart of our method are Kinetic Codes, a novel autoencoder-based sparse motion encoding, that exposes a semantically rich latent space, simplifying large-scale training. Our architecture comprises dedicated spatial and temporal gradient predictors, which are jointly trained in an end-to-end fashion. The combined network, regularized by the Kinetic Codes' latent space, has good generalization across both unseen shapes and new motions. We evaluated our method on unseen motion sampled from AMASS, D4D, Mixamo, and raw monocular video for animation transfer on various characters with varying shapes and topology. We report a new SoTA on the AMASS dataset in the context of generalization to unseen motion. Code, weights, and supplementary are available on the project webpage at https://motionfields.github.io/

Abstract: This paper introduces Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment with Onset-Aware Conditioning (TARO), a novel framework for high-fidelity and temporally coherent video-to-audio synthesis. Built upon flow-based transformers, which offer stable training and continuous transformations for enhanced synchronization and audio quality, TARO introduces two key innovations: (1) Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment (TRA), which dynamically aligns latent representations by adjusting alignment strength based on the noise schedule, ensuring smooth evolution and improved fidelity, and (2) Onset-Aware Conditioning (OAC), which integrates onset cues that serve as sharp event-driven markers of audio-relevant visual moments to enhance synchronization with dynamic visual events. Extensive experiments on the VGGSound and Landscape datasets demonstrate that TARO outperforms prior methods, achieving relatively 53% lower Frechet Distance (FD), 29% lower Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), and a 97.19% Alignment Accuracy, highlighting its superior audio quality and synchronization precision.

<title>What's Inside Your Diffusion Model? A Score-Based Riemannian Metric to Explore the Data Manifold</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable ability to capture complex image distributions, but the geometric properties of the learned data manifold remain poorly understood. We address this gap by introducing a score-based Riemannian metric that leverages the Stein score function from diffusion models to characterize the intrinsic geometry of the data manifold without requiring explicit parameterization. Our approach defines a metric tensor in the ambient space that stretches distances perpendicular to the manifold while preserving them along tangential directions, effectively creating a geometry where geodesics naturally follow the manifold's contours. We develop efficient algorithms for computing these geodesics and demonstrate their utility for both interpolation between data points and extrapolation beyond the observed data distribution. Through experiments on synthetic data with known geometry, Rotated MNIST, and complex natural images via Stable Diffusion, we show that our score-based geodesics capture meaningful transformations that respect the underlying data distribution. Our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches on perceptual metrics (LPIPS) and distribution-level metrics (FID, KID), producing smoother, more realistic image transitions. These results reveal the implicit geometric structure learned by diffusion models and provide a principled way to navigate the manifold of natural images through the lens of Riemannian geometry.

Abstract: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. In multimodal retrieval tasks, LEAF improves the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization. We open-source our code ( https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/LEAF ) and models ( https://huggingface.co/LEAF-CLIP ).

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the video domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. Furthermore, we propose two potential training-free mitigation strategies, revealing potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias: (i) enhancing visual grounding through interpretable key-frame selection and (ii) steering model behavior away from sycophancy via targeted, inference-time intervention on its internal neural representations. Our code is available at https://github.com/William030422/Video-Sycophancy.

<title>AMFT: Aligning LLM Reasoners by Meta-Learning the Optimal Imitation-Exploration Balance</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.

Abstract: Pediatric brain tumor segmentation presents unique challenges due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these malignancies, yet remains critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose an ensemble approach integrating nnU-Net, Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net for the BraTS-PED 2025 challenge. Our method incorporates three key extensions: adjustable initialization scales for optimal nnU-Net complexity control, transfer learning from BraTS 2021 pre-trained models to enhance Swin UNETR's generalization on pediatric dataset, and frequency domain decomposition for HFF-Net to separate low-frequency tissue contours from high-frequency texture details. Our final ensemble framework combines nnU-Net ($\gamma=0.7$), fine-tuned Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net, achieving Dice scores of 62.7% (CC), 83.2% (ED), 72.9% (ET), 85.7% (NET), 91.8% (TC), and 92.6% (WT) on the unseen test dataset, respectively. Our proposed method achieves first place (rank 1st) in the BraTS 2025 Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge.

Abstract: Simulating in silico cellular responses to interventions is a promising direction to accelerate high-content image-based assays, critical for advancing drug discovery and gene editing. To support this, we introduce MorphGen, a state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model for fluorescent microscopy that enables controllable generation across multiple cell types and perturbations. To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a state-of-the-art biological foundation model. Unlike prior approaches that compress multichannel stains into RGB images -- thus sacrificing organelle-specific detail -- MorphGen generates the complete set of fluorescent channels jointly, preserving per-organelle structures and enabling a fine-grained morphological analysis that is essential for biological interpretation. We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via CellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over 35% lower than the prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a single cell type. Code is available at https://github.com/czi-ai/MorphGen.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Granular-GRPO (G$^2$RPO) framework that achieves precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise, thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently, to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, demonstrate that our G$^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.

Summary:<br />
Equilibrium Matching (EqM) is a novel generative modeling framework that focuses on equilibrium dynamics. Unlike traditional diffusion and flow-based models, EqM learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape, enabling an optimization-based sampling process during inference. This approach results in superior generation performance, surpassing diffusion/flow models with an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256x256. EqM is not only empirically effective but also theoretically sound in learning and sampling from data manifolds. Additionally, it offers flexibility in tasks like image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with an equilibrium landscape, EqM provides a seamless integration between flow and energy-based models, making optimization-driven inference a straightforward process. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each architectural module and explore its interactions.

<div> dynamic camera motion, video quality, background scene consistency, foreground object consistency, text-to-video models

Summary:
DynamicEval introduces a new benchmark for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) models, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks. The benchmark focuses on dynamic camera motion and evaluates video quality based on background scene consistency and foreground object consistency. They propose new metrics for background consistency and foreground consistency, improving alignment with human judgments. The benchmark consists of systematically curated prompts with human annotations on video pairs generated by ten T2V models. The study identifies limitations in existing metrics, particularly in cases of occlusions/disocclusions, and presents solutions for more accurate evaluation of video quality. Extensive experiments show that the proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences, establishing DynamicEval as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation, however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with 45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases: occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements. Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion.

<div> Keywords: Fast convergence, high-quality image recovery, regularization by denoising, image priors, Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors

Summary: <br /><br />Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are crucial for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods like regularization by denoising (RED) typically focus on enhancing image priors for better reconstruction quality, leaving convergence acceleration as a heuristic. To address this gap, Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) is introduced as an extension of RED. RISP integrates restarting inertia for rapid convergence while incorporating score-based image priors for superior reconstruction. The method demonstrates a faster stationary-point convergence rate compared to RED without the need for image prior convexity. Additionally, the associated continuous-time dynamical system reveals the connection between RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experimental results confirm that RISP facilitates quick convergence and high-quality reconstructions across various imaging inverse problems. <div>

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods, such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

<div> Keywords: uLDCT, CT denoising, Image Purification, Frequency-domain Flow Matching, anatomical structure preservation

Summary: 
This paper introduces a denoising framework for ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) images, which have high noise and artifacts. The proposed Image Purification (IP) strategy creates aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs for network training. The Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model is then used to enhance anatomical structure preservation in denoised images. The real clinical dataset used in the study shows that the IP strategy improves the performance of existing denoising models on uLDCT images. The combination of FFM with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art results in preserving anatomical structures in uLDCT images. This work provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. The code and dataset used in the study are available at the provided GitHub link.

arXiv:2510.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

Despite recent improvements in semantic watermarking schemes, vulnerabilities exist, especially in resource-constrained adversarial settings. The authors introduce D2RA, a novel approach that can remove or weaken watermarks from images without requiring access to the underlying model. D2RA achieves this by leveraging natural priors across various representations to suppress watermark signals while maintaining visual quality. Experimental results across different watermarking schemes demonstrate the effectiveness of D2RA in reducing watermark detectability, highlighting inherent weaknesses in current designs.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free, single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability, revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs.

<div> Keywords: video style transfer, diffusion models, PickStyle, video-to-video, context-style classifier

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach, PickStyle, for video style transfer using diffusion models. A key challenge in this task is the lack of paired video data for supervision. PickStyle enhances pretrained video diffusion backbones with style adapters and leverages paired still image data with source-style correspondences for training. This framework inserts low-rank adapters into self-attention layers to specialize in motion-style transfer while maintaining alignment between video content and style. To address the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video, synthetic training clips are generated with shared augmentations simulating camera motion. The approach also introduces Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG) to factorize guidance into text (style) and video (context) directions, ensuring preservation of context in generated videos while effectively transferring style. Experimental results demonstrate that PickStyle produces temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video translations, outperforming existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion, ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Summary: 
This paper explores the challenge of assessing physical realism in video generated by models. While humans can easily detect violations of physical laws in videos, existing Video-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to do so. The authors introduce TRAVL, a training technique that improves motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs using a balanced dataset and trajectory-aware attention module. They also propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of 300 videos that allows for rigorous evaluation of physical reasoning in models. By combining TRAVL and ImplausiBench, the authors provide a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, addressing a critical yet underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.  <div>

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together, TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

Summary: 
- The article introduces a Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification that combines textual descriptions with spectral-spatial data to improve classification accuracy.
- S3FN leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate textual descriptions for each class label, capturing unique characteristics and spectral behaviors.

<br /><br />Summary:   <div>
arXiv:2510.07556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically augmented HSI classification models.

Summary:
Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL) is proposed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to prevent leakage of private data during tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). The method leverages visual tokens and external modules to encode unlearning information for sensitive queries. CAGUL is lightweight, efficient, and retains reference model behavior without the need for costly finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that CAGUL outperforms finetuning-based approaches, ensuring data privacy without modifying pre-trained model parameters. This approach offers a practical and effective solution for tackling privacy concerns in VLMs, safeguarding against information leakage while maintaining model accuracy. Additionally, CAGUL considers the complex interplay between visual and textual contexts in VLMs, making it a versatile and reliable unlearning framework for multi-modal tasks. <br /><br />Summary: Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL) is an efficient and effective framework designed to prevent private data leakage in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) during tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), offering a practical solution without the need for costly model finetuning. <div>
arXiv:2510.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference. Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research, informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10 growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production environments.

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs. neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits. Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however, is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further improve QCN.

<div> Classifier-free guidance, rectified flow, visual artifacts, text misalignment, large-scale text-to-image models<br />
Summary:<br />
Rectified-CFG++ is introduced as an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance method for rectified flow models. It combines the efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning rule to address issues such as off-manifold drift and visual artifacts. Each inference step involves a conditional update to anchor the sample near the learned transport path, followed by a weighted conditional correction that balances conditional and unconditional velocity fields. The resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and ensures stability within a bounded neighborhood of the data manifold. Extensive experiments on text-to-image models demonstrate that Rectified-CFG++ outperforms standard CFG on benchmark datasets, including MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench. The approach shows improved performance in handling text-conditioned targets, yielding better alignment and reducing drift in image synthesis tasks.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.07631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench.

We are interested in using these models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM, a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and interactivity.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams. Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the spatio- temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary information using cross- attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation (Q- ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging. Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement: specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading performance under these constraints.

<div> personalizing diffusion models, image generation, text prompt, IP-Adapter, segmentation<br />
<br />
In this study, the authors propose a method to improve the personalization of diffusion models for image generation. By utilizing the IP-Adapter to automatically generate masks that separate the subject from the background, the text prompt can focus on the subject rather than recreating the entire image. This approach allows for more accurate and detailed image generation based on the given prompt. The method involves using the generated mask to restrict image tokens to the subject, ensuring that the final image reflects both the subject and the prompt. Comparisons with other personalization methods show that this approach results in high alignment between the prompt and the source image. The proposed method is particularly effective for text prompts describing locations and places, producing images that closely match both the subject and the prompt.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background, allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high prompt and source image alignment.

<div> Keywords: pyramid networks, medical image registration, Feature-Enhanced Residual Module, Threshold-Controlled Iterative, generalizability

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach for medical image registration using a Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP) model. The model incorporates a Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) in each decoding layer to improve anatomical structure alignment. Additionally, a dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy dynamically determines the number of iterations for optimization based on image requirements. Experimental results on brain MRI and abdomen CT datasets show that TCIP outperforms existing registration networks in accuracy while maintaining speed and compactness. The generalizability of FERM and TCI is demonstrated through integration with other registration networks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Overall, TCIP improves registration accuracy by mitigating anatomical misalignments and adapting the optimization process based on image characteristics. <div>

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

The approach combines variational inference techniques with multiple video generation backbones to achieve this.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of induction motors for fault detection.

Summary: <br />
Deep hashing is a popular technique for large-scale image retrieval, with different optimization strategies available. Pairwise-based methods focus on local similarity relationships, while center-based methods excel in capturing global data distributions. However, center-based methods may underutilize local similarity information. To address this, Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH) introduces a weak-to-strong framework where a center-based branch learns from a weaker pairwise-based branch. Through iterative mutual learning and a mixture-of-hash-experts module, MLH enhances both branches by transferring knowledge and enabling cross-branch interaction. Experiments show that MLH outperforms existing hashing methods on various benchmark datasets. <div>

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However, the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch. Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore, inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction, further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality, large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and weights upon acceptance.

arXiv:2510.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses. Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

The article introduces a new method called ComGS for 3D object-scene composition in immersive rendering. It addresses challenges in combining objects and scenes by utilizing Gaussian Splatting and Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for efficient relightable object reconstruction. SOPs enable real-time shadow computation and at least a 2x speedup in reconstruction compared to existing methods. The framework simplifies scene lighting estimation by focusing on environment lighting at the object's placement, achieving high-quality results with vivid shadows. By capturing a 360-degree reconstructed radiance field and fine-tuning a diffusion model, ComGS achieves real-time rendering at around 28 FPS and requires only 36 seconds for editing. The proposed method provides visually harmonious results and offers code and dataset availability for further research and development. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360 degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for editing.

<div> Keywords: UHDR, dynamic range, RAW image, denoising, UltraLED

Summary:
Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes with exposure disparities pose challenges in preserving both highlight and shadow details. RGB-based bracketing methods may introduce misalignment and ghosting artifacts. This study proposes UltraLED, a two-stage framework using a single short-exposure RAW image for UHDR reconstruction. The framework corrects exposure imbalance using a ratio map and employs a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to enhance dark region detail recovery. A 9-stop bracketing pipeline synthesizes realistic UHDR images, with a dataset provided for diverse scenes. UltraLED outperforms existing single-frame approaches, avoiding ghosting and motion blur issues. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://srameo.github.io/projects/ultraled. <div>
arXiv:2510.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges, making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a 9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and dataset are made publicly available at https://srameo.github.io/projects/ultraled.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, event cameras, motion priors, event-Gaussian motion correspondence, optimization

Summary:<br /><br />
Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB videos faces challenges due to large inter-frame motions increasing solution space uncertainty. Event cameras capture rapid visual changes but lack color information, providing deterministic constraints for large motion. A novel framework optimizes Dynamic 3DGS from both RGB and event modalities by incorporating event motion priors. Motion priors are extracted from event streams using unsupervised fine-tuning to adapt an event flow estimator. A geometry-aware data association method creates event-Gaussian motion correspondence, supported by motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate outperformance of existing approaches, proving the efficacy of joint optimization using event data. <div>
arXiv:2510.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively, the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models. Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet (AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians' trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants (ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times, (ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii) classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new benchmark called Geo-Temporal Reasoning (GTR-Bench) to assess the geographic spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs). Current benchmarks focus on egocentric or geographic perspective reasoning but fail to evaluate VLMs' abilities with both image/video and graphics context. GTR-Bench presents challenges such as multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over unobserved spatial-temporal regions. Evaluation of VLMs on GTR-Bench reveals deficiencies in spatial-temporal context utilization, temporal forecasting, and aligning map data with multi-view video inputs. The best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, lags significantly behind human performance on geo-temporal reasoning. The benchmark aims to provide insights and opportunities for research in spatial-temporal intelligence. <div>
arXiv:2510.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

<div> Keywords: Facial micro-expressions, Optical flow, Motion representation, FMANet, Recognition networks <br />
Summary: <br />
Facial micro-expressions are subtle indicators of genuine emotions, challenging to capture but valuable in various fields. Current methods often miss essential motion information between micro-expression phases. This article introduces a new motion representation called Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF) that integrates motion dynamics from both micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor for recognition networks. The FMANet neural network architecture is proposed to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for classification, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmark datasets. The study demonstrates the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing micro-expression recognition. <div>

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements. Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods, underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing micro-expression recognition.

<div> Room geometry constraints, depth estimation, layout prediction, background segmentation, multi-scale features

Summary:
The paper presents a novel framework for predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor panoramas. Existing methods focus on pixel-level accuracy, resulting in oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity. The proposed framework integrates room geometry information through layout prediction and background segmentation to improve depth estimation. The model comprises a shared feature encoder and task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. Two strategies are incorporated: a room geometry-based background depth resolving strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods compared to current open-source methods. The code for the framework is available at https://github.com/emiyaning/RGCNet.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

<div> Visual prompting, fine-tuning, parameter-efficient, model adaptation, ACAVP <br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Visual prompting (VP) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for adapting pre-trained vision models without changing parameters. However, conventional VP methods have limitations in expressivity and overfitting. To address these issues, ACAVP introduces affine and color transformations to enhance VP's power while mitigating overfitting with TrivialAugment data augmentation. ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing, and shows robustness to distribution shifts, with minimal computational overhead during inference. This highlights the importance of data augmentation for VP training and the effectiveness of complementary transformations in improving performance. <div>
arXiv:2510.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP (Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead during inference.

arXiv:2510.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale, Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12 everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14 interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object 3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, urban environments, regularization framework, multi-scale supervision, physically-grounded

Summary:
PrismGS addresses the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in rendering large urban environments by introducing a regularization framework. It integrates pyramidal multi-scale supervision to ensure anti-aliased representation across different viewing scales, reducing flickering textures. Additionally, an explicit size regularization imposes constraints on Gaussian dimensions, preventing the formation of degenerate primitives and minimizing jagged edges. The method is compatible with existing pipelines and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D datasets. PrismGS achieves significant PSNR gains of around 1.5 dB compared to CityGaussian, while maintaining superior quality and robustness in high-resolution (4K) rendering scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2510.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing ``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1 accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics (PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output.

<div> Keywords: 3D models, indoor scenes, semantic understanding, sparse-view reconstruction, semantic priors 

Summary: 
AlignGS is a new framework designed to address the challenge of creating semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes from sparse views. Unlike existing methods that treat semantics as a passive feature, AlignGS integrates semantic understanding as an active guiding force in the reconstruction process. By leveraging rich priors from 2D foundation models, the framework optimizes the geometry and semantics simultaneously using novel guidance mechanisms such as depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Through extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks, AlignGS demonstrates superior results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions with enhanced geometric accuracy. The approach showcases that utilizing semantic priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more complete and coherent 3D models generated from limited input views. The code for AlignGS is available on GitHub for further exploration.

arXiv:2510.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models from limited input views.

Summary:  
XYZCylinder introduces a feedforward reconstruction paradigm for driving scenes, addressing challenges related to generalization and accuracy. It utilizes a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy to handle different camera configurations effectively. This approach eliminates the need to learn viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence, enhancing generalization across diverse scenes. Additionally, a hybrid representation based on the Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) is proposed to lift 2D image features to 3D space, improving reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate XYZCylinder's state-of-the-art performance under various evaluation settings and its ability to generalize to new driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.

<div> Benchmarking, Anomaly Detection, Anomaly Synthesis, ASBench, Manufacturing Quality Control

Summary:
ASBench is a novel framework focused on evaluating anomaly synthesis methods for manufacturing quality control. It addresses the lack of systematic evaluation in existing studies and highlights the importance of factors specific to anomaly synthesis. The framework introduces four key evaluation dimensions: generalization performance across datasets and pipelines, ratio of synthetic to real data, correlation between synthesis image metrics and anomaly detection performance, and strategies for hybrid synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments, ASBench identifies current limitations in anomaly synthesis methods and provides insights for future research directions in the field. <div>

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection, quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv) strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments, ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly synthesis

<div> Keywords: Video Foundation Models, Test-Time Optimization and Memorization, spatiotemporal layouts, compositional world knowledge, cross-modal alignment<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework for improving text-image alignment in Video Foundation Models (VFMs) in compositional scenarios. Instead of directly intervening in latents or attention per-sample, TTOM integrates and optimizes new parameters guided by a layout-attention objective during inference. The framework also formulates video generation within a streaming setting and utilizes a parametric memory mechanism to maintain historical optimization contexts, enabling operations like insert, read, update, and delete. TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showcasing strong transferability and generalization abilities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets T2V-CompBench and Vbench confirm TTOM's effectiveness, practicality, scalability, and efficiency for achieving cross-modal alignment in compositional video generation on the fly. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy, and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation on the fly.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

<div> dataset, anime, text, detection, images
Summary:
The article introduces AnimeText, a large-scale dataset designed for text detection in anime scenes. Existing text detection datasets are not suitable for anime scenarios, as text in anime scenes is diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and may be confused with visual elements. AnimeText contains 735K images and 4.2M annotated text blocks, with hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples tailored for anime scenes. Cross-dataset evaluations show that models trained on AnimeText outperform those trained on existing datasets for anime text detection tasks. The dataset's robustness in complex anime scenes was evaluated through benchmarking, confirming its superior performance. The dataset is available on HuggingFace for researchers to access and utilize for further research in text detection in anime scenes.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes, where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines. However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection tasks.

Summary:
SimCast is a novel training pipeline for precipitation nowcasting that incorporates a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique and a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. The model generates deterministic predictions without increasing inference overhead. CasCast, a diffusion-based framework, integrates SimCast to combine the strengths of deterministic and probabilistic models, addressing limitations like blurriness and distribution shift. Experimental results on SEVIR, HKO-7, and MeteoNet datasets show significant improvement over existing approaches, with mean CSI scores of 0.452, 0.474, and 0.361, respectively. The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of considering prediction horizons and integrating deterministic and probabilistic models for accurate precipitation nowcasting. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and 0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin.

Summary: 
The article introduces Latent Harmony, a framework for Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration that balances computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. The framework consists of two stages: LH-VAE, which refines VAEs for UHD restoration by enhancing semantic robustness and high-frequency reconstruction, and High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA), which jointly trains the refined VAE with a restoration model to recover authentic details and synthesize realistic textures. The framework allows for flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs through a tunable parameter. Experiment results show that Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance in both UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.

<div> Object tags, abstract tags, computer vision tasks, image privacy, tag budget<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper investigates the effectiveness of object tags versus abstract tags in the context of image privacy classification. Object tags represent concrete entities in images, while abstract tags capture higher-level, subjective information. The study shows that when the tag budget is limited, abstract tags are more efficient for privacy classification. However, with a larger number of tags per image, object-related information becomes equally valuable. These findings suggest that the type and quantity of tags play a crucial role in developing accurate image privacy classifiers. By understanding the role of different tag types, future research can optimize image privacy classification algorithms for improved performance. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy. While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely, when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag types and quantity.

Summary:<br />
- The study focuses on enhancing low-light imagery by comparing the performance and efficiency of a Transformer-based SwinIR model with a standard lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
- SwinIR achieved higher peak performance with a PSNR of 39.03 dB, while surprisingly, the CNN also performed well with a competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB.
- The CNN reached its performance level in just 10 training epochs, in contrast to the 132 epochs required by SwinIR. 
- Despite the performance difference, the CNN is significantly smaller in size, being over 55 times smaller than SwinIR.
- The study highlights that a standard CNN can provide nearly state-of-the-art results with much lower computational requirements, making it a practical choice for real-world applications with resource constraints. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially, the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead, presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource constraints are a primary concern.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces GraphEnet, a Graph Neural Network designed for Human Pose Estimation using event-based cameras. Event-based cameras are gaining popularity for their low latency and energy efficiency, making them suitable for resource-constrained applications. GraphEnet utilizes the sparse nature of event camera output and an intermediate line-based representation to estimate 2D Human Pose at a high frequency. The network incorporates a novel offset vector learning approach with confidence-based pooling to improve pose estimation accuracy. This work represents the first application of Graph Neural Networks to event data for Human Pose Estimation. The code for GraphEnet is available as open-source, providing a valuable resource for researchers and developers interested in leveraging event-based cameras for pose estimation tasks.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network, GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human pose.

<div> Keywords: Composed Image Retrieval, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, structured CoT annotations

Summary: 
Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to find a target image by utilizing a reference image and modification text, necessitating unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While existing models like Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown progress, they lack transparency and struggle with complex instructions. To address this, CIR-CoT introduces end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM with explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, enhancing both retrieval accuracy and interpretability. By creating structured CoT annotations through a three-stage process and fine-tuning the model accordingly, CIR-CoT achieves competitive performance on in-domain datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR, while also demonstrating strong generalization on out-of-domain datasets like CIRCO. This work paves the way for more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption, reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset, establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems.

By utilizing ray occupancy information from collaborators, RayFusion enhances the accuracy of 3D object detection by reducing redundancy and false positives along camera rays. The method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in comprehensive experiments, advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception systems. The code for RayFusion is publicly available, allowing for implementation and further development in the autonomous driving community. <div>

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g., 3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels (e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a significant reduction in computational complexity.

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS) of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media. While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9 commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found "in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover, RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators. Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain, intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared to conventional datasets.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora), urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD.

<title>DarkHash: A Data-Free Backdoor Attack Against Deep Hashing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08094</link>

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency, deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval. Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results, they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns. Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

<title>Efficient Label Refinement for Face Parsing Under Extreme Poses Using 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two 3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing. Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective solution for improving face parsing robustness in real- world settings.

<title>Random Window Augmentations for Deep Learning Robustness in CT and Liver Tumor Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload. Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation. However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing. We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

<title>Real-Time Motion-Controllable Autoregressive Video Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page: https://kesenzhao.github.io/AR-Drag.github.io/.

<title>Improving Temporal Understanding Logic Consistency in Video-Language Models via Attention Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads, validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal understanding.

<title>UniMMVSR: A Unified Multi-Modal Framework for Cascaded Video Super-Resolution</title>

arXiv:2510.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with existing techniques.

<title>Beyond Textual CoT: Interleaved Text-Image Chains with Deep Confidence Reasoning for Image Editing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08157</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step. By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset, comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that our method yields significant improvements across three image editing benchmarks.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost. Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately, real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

<title>InstructUDrag: Joint Text Instructions and Object Dragging for Interactive Image Editing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing, with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately, refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over image content.

<title>Fine-grained text-driven dual-human motion generation via dynamic hierarchical interaction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage, predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

<title>Adaptive Gradient Calibration for Single-Positive Multi-Label Learning in Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification</title>

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels. While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC), a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across diverse settings.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present, e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point, enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation. While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel, we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with all the other queries to directly encode the global context information. Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of 11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain. Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful, demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs, our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85% human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images. More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a few lines of MATLAB code.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales. However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work, we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model, which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep generative models for data augmentation.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols. However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85% IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various visual styles.

<title>Robust Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation based on Curriculum Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

<title>VideoVerse: How Far is Your T2V Generator from a World Model?</title>

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies, which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First, current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models. Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes, sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions. Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V generators are from world models.

<title>Large Scale Diffusion Distillation via Score-Regularized Continuous-Time Consistency</title>

arXiv:2510.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models. Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering" nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion distillation.

<title>Gaze on the Prize: Shaping Visual Attention with Return-Guided Contrastive Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing, integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity. Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation, and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes, respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection, Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment), Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and computer vision.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination. Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent robustness and generalization.

<title>The Visual Iconicity Challenge: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Sign Language Form-Meaning Mapping</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the \textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$ state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines; and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}. Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress, most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise, compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first \underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo \underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment. Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored \underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in general-purpose video restoration systems.

<title>To Sink or Not to Sink: Visual Information Pathways in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

arXiv:2510.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end -- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems, especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes, enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging, achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained with raw LiDAR scans.

arXiv:2510.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small, randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich, task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis, which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing PEFT techniques.

FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues, enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible action control and mesh animations.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization, single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models, followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes, without requiring attribute-specific training.

<title>MM-HELIX: Boosting Multimodal Long-Chain Reflective Reasoning with Holistic Platform and Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability. Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable MLLMs.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm) pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4) unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

<title>ARTDECO: Towards Efficient and High-Fidelity On-the-Fly 3D Reconstruction with Structured Scene Representation</title>

arXiv:2510.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff: per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive, whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both accurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

<title>Dream to Recall: Imagination-Guided Experience Retrieval for Memory-Persistent Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1) a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this imagination-guided paradigm.

<title>VideoCanvas: Unified Video Completion from Arbitrary Spatiotemporal Patches via In-Context Conditioning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision, however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models: the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC) paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control: spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms, establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

arXiv:2510.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills. To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system. Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs, driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

<title>MultiCOIN: Multi-Modal COntrollable Video INbetweening</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex, or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process, resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally, we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

<title>ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that, we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs. Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs. Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future study of native MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations. However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS, comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times 256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed.

arXiv:2411.15876v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each. This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set, considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods, establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/Saiful185/DUA-D2C.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited. Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances. The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness learning methods.

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development, leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder, which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch, reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup, our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

<title>MLLM4TS: Leveraging Vision and Multimodal Language Models for General Time-Series Analysis</title>

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g., classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting). These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series analysis.

<title>Test-Time Matching: Unlocking Compositional Reasoning in Multimodal Models</title>

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative, self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16 dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of compositional reasoning.

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size, brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/- 11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images. Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC). Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89 for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs. 48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard). Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule detection.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions. Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning, endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the challenge.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise, are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes, handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency. FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis, offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data, but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration. To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion. Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF) module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

Abstract: Instruction-following navigation is a key step toward embodied intelligence. Prior benchmarks mainly focus on semantic understanding but overlook systematically evaluating navigation agents' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. In this work, we introduce the NavSpace benchmark, which contains six task categories and 1,228 trajectory-instruction pairs designed to probe the spatial intelligence of navigation agents. On this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art navigation models and multimodal large language models. The evaluation results lift the veil on spatial intelligence in embodied navigation. Furthermore, we propose SNav, a new spatially intelligent navigation model. SNav outperforms existing navigation agents on NavSpace and real robot tests, establishing a strong baseline for future work.

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance. While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial, as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually 'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models. Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other visual media.

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing methods for neural-field filtering.

<title>Biology-driven assessment of deep learning super-resolution imaging of the porosity network in dentin</title>

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/Luo-Yihong/DGPO.

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD. Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19% in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power. Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$ fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or adaptation frameworks. The project page is https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/SplatNet/.

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image and audio.

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness, metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry, and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention, which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154 rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions. Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself. To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data. R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on mobile manipulation.

<title>DexNDM: Closing the Reality Gap for Dexterous In-Hand Rotation via Joint-Wise Neural Dynamics Model</title>

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios, constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention. Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals), high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

<title>How to Teach Large Multimodal Models New Skills</title>

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii) updating only the MLP Gate&amp;Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance. Code is available at https://github.com/jessemelpolio/LMM_CL

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms. We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without demonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work, we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13% improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

Abstract: In current text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), videos to be retrieved have been properly trimmed so that a correspondence between the videos and ad-hoc textual queries naturally exists. Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.

Abstract: Smart glasses are rapidly gaining advanced functions thanks to cutting-edge computing technologies, especially accelerated hardware architectures, and tiny Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. However, integrating AI into smart glasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity remains challenging for a satisfactory user experience. To this end, this paper proposes the design of a smart glasses platform for always-on on-device object detection with an all-day battery lifetime. The proposed platform is based on GAP9, a novel multi-core RISC-V processor from Greenwaves Technologies. Additionally, a family of sub-million parameter TinyissimoYOLO networks are proposed. They are benchmarked on established datasets, capable of differentiating up to 80 classes on MS-COCO. Evaluations on the smart glasses prototype demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's inference latency of only 17ms and consuming 1.59mJ energy per inference. An end-to-end latency of 56ms is achieved which is equivalent to 18 frames per seconds (FPS) with a total power consumption of 62.9mW. This ensures continuous system runtime of up to 9.3 hours on a 154mAh battery. These results outperform MCUNet (TinyNAS+TinyEngine), which runs a simpler task (image classification) at just 7.3 FPS, while the 18 FPS achieved in this paper even include image-capturing, network inference, and detection post-processing. The algorithm's code is released open with this paper and can be found here: https://github.com/ETH-PBL/TinyissimoYOLO

Abstract: Albeit the scalable performance of vision transformers (ViTs), the dense computational costs (training & inference) undermine their position in industrial applications. Post-training quantization (PTQ), tuning ViTs with a tiny dataset and running in a low-bit format, well addresses the cost issue but unluckily bears more performance drops in lower-bit cases. In this paper, we introduce I&amp;S-ViT, a novel method that regulates the PTQ of ViTs in an inclusive and stable fashion. I&amp;S-ViT first identifies two issues in the PTQ of ViTs: (1) Quantization inefficiency in the prevalent log2 quantizer for post-Softmax activations; (2) Rugged and magnified loss landscape in coarse-grained quantization granularity for post-LayerNorm activations. Then, I&amp;S-ViT addresses these issues by introducing: (1) A novel shift-uniform-log2 quantizer (SULQ) that incorporates a shift mechanism followed by uniform quantization to achieve both an inclusive domain representation and accurate distribution approximation; (2) A three-stage smooth optimization strategy (SOS) that amalgamates the strengths of channel-wise and layer-wise quantization to enable stable learning. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse vision tasks validate I&amp;S-ViT' superiority over existing PTQ of ViTs methods, particularly in low-bit scenarios. For instance, I&amp;S-ViT elevates the performance of 3-bit ViT-B by an impressive 50.68%.

Abstract: Writer identification due to its widespread application in various fields has gained popularity over the years. In scenarios where optimum handwriting samples are available, whether they be in the form of a single line, a sentence, or an entire page, writer identification algorithms have demonstrated noteworthy levels of accuracy. However, in scenarios where only a limited number of handwritten samples are available, particularly in the form of word images, there is a significant scope for improvement.
  In this paper, we propose a writer identification system based on an attention-driven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is trained utilizing image segments, known as fragments, extracted from word images, employing a pyramid-based strategy. This methodology enables the system to capture a comprehensive representation of the data, encompassing both fine-grained details and coarse features across various levels of abstraction. These extracted fragments serve as the training data for the convolutional network, enabling it to learn a more robust representation compared to traditional convolution-based networks trained on word images. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of an attention mechanism to enhance the representational power of the learned features. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on three benchmark databases, demonstrating its proficiency in writer identification tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited access to handwriting data.

Abstract: Detecting falsified faces generated by Deepfake technology is essential for safeguarding trust in digital communication and protecting individuals. However, current detectors often suffer from a dual-overfitting: they become overly specialized in both specific forgery fingerprints and particular demographic attributes. Critically, most existing methods overlook the latter issue, which results in poor fairness: faces from certain demographic groups, such as different genders or ethnicities, are consequently more difficult to reliably detect. To address this challenge, we propose a novel strategy called misleading-learning, which populates the latent space with a multitude of redundant environments. By exposing the detector to a sufficiently rich and balanced variety of high-level information for demographic fairness, our approach mitigates demographic bias while maintaining a high detection performance level. We conduct extensive evaluations on fairness, intra-domain detection, cross-domain generalization, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves superior fairness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We present a simple yet effective method to improve the robustness of both Convolutional and attention-based Neural Networks against adversarial examples by post-processing an adversarially trained model. Our technique, MeanSparse, cascades the activation functions of a trained model with novel operators that sparsify mean-centered feature vectors. This is equivalent to reducing feature variations around the mean, and we show that such reduced variations merely affect the model's utility, yet they strongly attenuate the adversarial perturbations and decrease the attacker's success rate. Our experiments show that, when applied to the top models in the RobustBench leaderboard, MeanSparse achieves a new robustness record of 75.28% (from 73.71%), 44.78% (from 42.67%) and 62.12% (from 59.56%) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively, in terms of AutoAttack accuracy.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate reconstruction of a relightable, dynamic clothed human avatar from a monocular video is crucial for the entertainment industry. This paper presents SGIA (Surfel-based Gaussian Inverse Avatar), which introduces efficient training and rendering for relightable dynamic human reconstruction. SGIA advances previous Gaussian Avatar methods by comprehensively modeling Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) properties for clothed human avatars, allowing for the manipulation of avatars into novel poses under diverse lighting conditions. Specifically, our approach integrates pre-integration and image-based lighting for fast light calculations that surpass the performance of existing implicit-based techniques. To address challenges related to material lighting disentanglement and accurate geometry reconstruction, we propose an innovative occlusion approximation strategy and a progressive training approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGIA not only achieves highly accurate physical properties but also significantly enhances the realistic relighting of dynamic human avatars, providing a substantial speed advantage. We exhibit more results in our project page: https://GS-IA.github.io.

Abstract: Human motion capture is the foundation for many computer vision and graphics tasks. While industrial motion capture systems with complex camera arrays or expensive wearable sensors have been widely adopted in movie and game production, consumer-affordable and easy-to-use solutions for personal applications are still far from mature. To utilize a mixture of a monocular camera and very few inertial measurement units (IMUs) for accurate multi-modal human motion capture in daily life, we contribute MINIONS in this paper, a large-scale Motion capture dataset collected from INertial and visION Sensors. MINIONS has several featured properties: 1) large scale of over five million frames and 400 minutes duration; 2) multi-modality data of IMUs signals and RGB videos labeled with joint positions, joint rotations, SMPL parameters, etc.; 3) a diverse set of 146 fine-grained single and interactive actions with textual descriptions. With the proposed MINIONS dataset, we propose a SparseNet framework to capture human motion from IMUs and videos by discovering their supplementary features and exploring the possibilities of consumer-affordable motion capture using a monocular camera and very few IMUs. The experiment results emphasize the unique advantages of inertial and vision sensors, showcasing the promise of consumer-affordable multi-modal motion capture and providing a valuable resource for further research and development.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for Transformer-based semantic segmentation typically adopt Transformer decoders that are used to extract additional embeddings from image embeddings via cross-attention, refine either or both types of embeddings via self-attention, and project image embeddings onto the additional embeddings via dot-product. Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on dataset ADE20K find that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, and it is light weight and more robust.

Abstract: Curvature angle is a quantitative measurement of a curve, in which Cobb angle is customized for spinal curvature. Automatic Cobb angle measurement from X-ray images is crucial for scoliosis screening and diagnosis. However, most existing regression-based and segmentation-based methods struggle with inaccurate spine representations or mask connectivity and fragmentation issues. Besides, landmark-based methods suffer from insufficient training data and annotations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel curvature angle estimation framework named CurvNet including latent contour representation based contour detection and iterative data engine based image self-generation. Specifically, we propose a parameterized spine contour representation in latent space, which enables eigen-spine decomposition and spine contour reconstruction. Latent contour coefficient regression is combined with anchor box classification to solve inaccurate predictions and mask connectivity issues. Moreover, we develop a data engine with image self-generation, automatic annotation, and automatic selection in an iterative manner. By our data engine, we generate a clean dataset named Spinal-AI2024 without privacy leaks, which is the largest released scoliosis X-ray dataset to our knowledge. Extensive experiments on public AASCE2019, our private Spinal2023, and our generated Spinal-AI2024 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art Cobb angle estimation performance. Our code and Spinal-AI2024 dataset are available at https://github.com/Ernestchenchen/CurvNet and https://github.com/Ernestchenchen/Spinal-AI2024, respectively.

Abstract: Accurate meshing from monocular images remains a key challenge in 3D vision. While state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods excel at synthesizing photorealistic novel views through rasterization-based rendering, their reliance on sparse, explicit primitives severely limits their ability to recover watertight and topologically consistent 3D surfaces.We introduce MonoGSDF, a novel method that couples Gaussian-based primitives with a neural Signed Distance Field (SDF) for high-quality reconstruction. During training, the SDF guides Gaussians' spatial distribution, while at inference, Gaussians serve as priors to reconstruct surfaces, eliminating the need for memory-intensive Marching Cubes. To handle arbitrary-scale scenes, we propose a scaling strategy for robust generalization. A multi-resolution training scheme further refines details and monocular geometric cues from off-the-shelf estimators enhance reconstruction quality. Experiments on real-world datasets show MonoGSDF outperforms prior methods while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Standard clothing asset generation involves restoring forward-facing flat-lay garment images displayed on a clear background by extracting clothing information from diverse real-world contexts, which presents significant challenges due to highly standardized structure sampling distributions and clothing semantic absence in complex scenarios. Existing models have limited spatial perception, often exhibiting structural hallucinations and texture distortion in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating knowledge from language models and external databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a coarse-to-fine texture alignment that ensures fidelity in pattern and detail components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and texture-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity.

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval is a critical task for managing diverse visual content, but common benchmarks for the task rely on small, single-domain datasets that fail to capture real-world complexity. Pre-trained vision-language models tend to perform well with easy negatives but struggle with hard negatives--visually similar yet incorrect images--especially in open-domain scenarios. To address this, we introduce Episodic Few-Shot Adaptation (EFSA), a novel test-time framework that adapts pre-trained models dynamically to a query's domain by fine-tuning on top-k retrieved candidates and synthetic captions generated for them. EFSA improves performance across diverse domains while preserving generalization, as shown in evaluations on queries from eight highly distinct visual domains and an open-domain retrieval pool of over one million images. Our work highlights the potential of episodic few-shot adaptation to enhance robustness in the critical and understudied task of open-domain text-to-image retrieval.

Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

Abstract: Large-scale astronomical image data processing and prediction are essential for astronomers, providing crucial insights into celestial objects, the universe's history, and its evolution. While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. Using redshift prediction with the AstroMAE model demonstrated CAI's scalability and efficiency, achieving inference on a 12.6 GB dataset in only 28 seconds compared to 140.8 seconds on HPC GPUs and 1793 seconds on HPC CPUs. CAI also achieved significantly higher throughput, reaching 18.04 billion bits per second (bps), and maintained near-constant inference times as data sizes increased, all at minimal computational cost (under $5 per experiment). We also process large-scale data up to 1 TB to show CAI's effectiveness at scale. CAI thus provides a highly scalable, accessible, and cost-effective inference solution for the astronomy community.

<title>Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting for Robust Gradual Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$ (progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains. Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Dramwig/STDW.

<title>H3DE-Net: Efficient and Accurate 3D Landmark Detection in Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: 3D landmark detection is a critical task in medical image analysis, and accurately detecting anatomical landmarks is essential for subsequent medical imaging tasks. However, mainstream deep learning methods in this field struggle to simultaneously capture fine-grained local features and model global spatial relationships, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Local feature extraction requires capturing fine-grained anatomical details, while global modeling requires understanding the spatial relationships within complex anatomical structures. The high-dimensional nature of 3D volume further exacerbates these challenges, as landmarks are sparsely distributed, leading to significant computational costs. Therefore, achieving efficient and precise 3D landmark detection remains a pressing challenge in medical image analysis.
  In this work, We propose a \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{3}D \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{Net}(H3DE-Net), a novel framework that combines CNNs for local feature extraction with a lightweight attention mechanism designed to efficiently capture global dependencies in 3D volumetric data. This mechanism employs a hierarchical routing strategy to reduce computational cost while maintaining global context modeling. To our knowledge, H3DE-Net is the first 3D landmark detection model that integrates such a lightweight attention mechanism with CNNs. Additionally, integrating multi-scale feature fusion further enhances detection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on a public CT dataset demonstrate that H3DE-Net achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, significantly improving accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with missing landmarks or complex anatomical variations. We aready open-source our project, including code, data and model weights.

<title>TransMamba: Fast Universal Architecture Adaption from Transformers to Mamba</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the backbone of both uni-modal and multi-modal foundation models, largely due to their scalability via attention mechanisms, resulting in a rich ecosystem of publicly available pre-trained models such as LLaVA, CLIP, and DeiT, etc. In parallel, emerging sub-quadratic architectures like Mamba offer promising efficiency gains by enabling global context modeling with linear complexity. However, training these architectures from scratch remains resource-intensive (e.g., in terms of data and time). Motivated by this challenge, we explore a cross-architecture knowledge transfer paradigm, termed TransMamba, that facilitates the reuse of Transformer pre-trained knowledge. We propose a two-stage framework to accelerate the training of Mamba-based models, ensuring their effectiveness across both uni-modal and multi-modal tasks. The first stage leverages pre-trained Transformer models to initialize critical components of the Mamba architecture. To bridge architectural and dimensional gaps, we develop a selective weight subcloning strategy and a layered initialization scheme that prioritizes the early $n$ layers. Building on this initialization, the second stage introduces an adaptive multi-directional knowledge distillation method. This mechanism employs layer-wise adaptive scaling factors to align Mamba representations with their Transformer counterparts, while accommodating the scanning order variations inherent to multi-modal Mamba architectures. Despite operating with a reduced training dataset and a more compact model architecture, TransMamba consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse mamba-based backbones (e.g., PlainMamba, Vmamba, ViM and VideoMamba) and downstream tasks (e.g., image classification, visual question answering, text-video retrieval and multimodal reasoning). All code and implementation details will be released.

Abstract: This paper's primary objective is to develop a robust generalist perception model capable of addressing multiple tasks under constraints of computational resources and limited training data. We leverage text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of images and successfully introduce our DICEPTION, a visual generalist model. Exhaustive evaluations demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles diverse perception tasks, even achieving performance comparable to SOTA single-task specialist models. Specifically, we achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs.\ 1B pixel-level annotated images). We designed comprehensive experiments on architectures and input paradigms, demonstrating that the key to successfully re-purposing a single diffusion model for multiple perception tasks lies in maximizing the preservation of the pre-trained model's prior knowledge. Consequently, DICEPTION can be trained with substantially lower computational costs than conventional models requiring training from scratch. Furthermore, adapting DICEPTION to novel tasks is highly efficient, necessitating fine-tuning on as few as 50 images and approximately 1% of its parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that a subtle application of classifier-free guidance can improve the model's performance on depth and normal estimation. We also show that pixel-aligned training, as is characteristic of perception tasks, significantly enhances the model's ability to preserve fine details. DICEPTION offers valuable insights and presents a promising direction for the development of advanced diffusion-based visual generalist models. Code and Model: https://github.com/aim-uofa/Diception

<title>Spiking Meets Attention: Efficient Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution with Attention Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as a promising alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), offering biological plausibility and energy efficiency. Despite these merits, SNNs are frequently hampered by limited capacity and insufficient representation power, yet remain underexplored in remote sensing super-resolution (SR) tasks. In this paper, we first observe that spiking signals exhibit drastic intensity variations across diverse textures, highlighting an active learning state of the neurons. This observation motivates us to apply SNNs for efficient SR of RSIs. Inspired by the success of attention mechanisms in representing salient information, we devise the spiking attention block (SAB), a concise yet effective component that optimizes membrane potentials through inferred attention weights, which, in turn, regulates spiking activity for superior feature representation. Our key contributions include: 1) we bridge the independent modulation between temporal and channel dimensions, facilitating joint feature correlation learning, and 2) we access the global self-similar patterns in large-scale remote sensing imagery to infer spatial attention weights, incorporating effective priors for realistic and faithful reconstruction. Building upon SAB, we proposed SpikeSR, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across various remote sensing benchmarks such as AID, DOTA, and DIOR, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Code of SpikeSR will be available at https://github.com/XY-boy/SpikeSR.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from a single image is a fundamentally ill-posed task due to the severely under-constrained nature of the problem. Consequently, when the scene is rendered from novel camera views, existing single image to 3D reconstruction methods render incoherent and blurry views. This problem is exacerbated when the unseen regions are far away from the input camera. In this work, we address these inherent limitations in existing single image-to-3D scene feedforward networks. To alleviate the poor performance due to insufficient information beyond the input image's view, we leverage a strong generative prior in the form of a pre-trained latent video diffusion model, for iterative refinement of a coarse scene represented by optimizable Gaussian parameters. To ensure that the style and texture of the generated images align with that of the input image, we incorporate on-the-fly Fourier-style transfer between the generated images and the input image. Additionally, we design a semantic uncertainty quantification module that calculates the per-pixel entropy and yields uncertainty maps used to guide the refinement process from the most confident pixels while discarding the remaining highly uncertain ones. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world scene datasets, including in-domain RealEstate-10K and out-of-domain KITTI-v2, showing that our approach can provide more realistic and high-fidelity novel view synthesis results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is crucial for multi-sensor systems. However, traditional methods often rely on physical targets, which are impractical for real-world deployment. Moreover, even carefully calibrated extrinsics can degrade over time due to sensor drift or external disturbances, necessitating periodic recalibration. To address these challenges, we present a Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration (TLC-Calib) that jointly optimizes sensor poses with a neural Gaussian-based scene representation. Reliable LiDAR points are frozen as anchor Gaussians to preserve global structure, while auxiliary Gaussians prevent local overfitting under noisy initialization. Our fully differentiable pipeline with photometric and geometric regularization achieves robust and generalizable calibration, consistently outperforming existing targetless methods on KITTI-360, Waymo, and FAST-LIVO2, and surpassing even the provided calibrations in rendering quality.

Abstract: Instance segmentation demands costly per-pixel annotations and computationally expensive models. We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pre-trained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM(s) via self-training with contrastive calibration, (2) knowledge transfer through a unified multi-objective loss, and (3) student refinement to mitigate residual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to extract informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11x smaller student improves over its zero-shot VFM teacher(s) by +8.5 and +7.1 AP, surpasses adapted teacher(s) by +3.4 and +1.5 AP, and further outperforms state-of-the-art SSKD methods on both benchmarks.

Abstract: Document dewarping aims to rectify deformations in photographic document images, thus improving text readability, which has attracted much attention and made great progress, but it is still challenging to preserve document structures. Given recent advances in diffusion models, it is natural for us to consider their potential applicability to document dewarping. However, it is far from straightforward to adopt diffusion models in document dewarping due to their unfaithful control on highly complex document images (e.g., 2000$times$3000 resolution). In this paper, we propose DvD, the first generative model to tackle document Dewarping via a Diffusion framework. To be specific, DvD introduces a coordinate-level denoising instead of typical pixel-level denoising, generating a mapping for deformation rectification. In addition, we further propose a time-variant condition refinement mechanism to enhance the preservation of document structures. In experiments, we find that current document dewarping benchmarks can not evaluate dewarping models comprehensively. To this end, we present AnyPhotoDoc6300, a rigorously designed large-scale document dewarping benchmark comprising 6,300 real image pairs across three distinct domains, enabling fine-grained evaluation of dewarping models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DvD can achieve state-of-the-art performance with acceptable computational efficiency on multiple metrics across various benchmarks, including DocUNet, DIR300, and AnyPhotoDoc6300. The new benchmark and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/hanquansanren/DvD.

Abstract: Document Image Enhancement (DIE) serves as a critical component in Document AI systems, where its performance substantially determines the effectiveness of downstream tasks. To address the limitations of existing methods confined to single-degradation restoration or grayscale image processing, we present Global with Local Parametric Generation Enhancement Network (GL-PGENet), a novel architecture designed for multi-degraded color document images, ensuring both efficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our solution incorporates three key innovations: First, a hierarchical enhancement framework that integrates global appearance correction with local refinement, enabling coarse-to-fine quality improvement. Second, a Dual-Branch Local-Refine Network with parametric generation mechanisms that replaces conventional direct prediction, producing enhanced outputs through learned intermediate parametric representations rather than pixel-wise mapping. This approach enhances local consistency while improving model generalization. Finally, a modified NestUNet architecture incorporating dense block to effectively fuse low-level pixel features and high-level semantic features, specifically adapted for document image characteristics. In addition, to enhance generalization performance, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: large-scale pretraining on a synthetic dataset of 500,000+ samples followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GL-PGENet, achieving state-of-the-art SSIM scores of 0.7721 on DocUNet and 0.9480 on RealDAE. The model also exhibits remarkable cross-domain adaptability and maintains computational efficiency for high-resolution images without performance degradation, confirming its practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We tackle the task of any-reference video generation, which aims to synthesize videos conditioned on arbitrary types and combinations of reference subjects, together with textual prompts. This task faces persistent challenges, including identity inconsistency, entanglement among multiple reference subjects, and copy-paste artifacts. To address these issues, we introduce MAGREF, a unified and effective framework for any-reference video generation. Our approach incorporates masked guidance and a subject disentanglement mechanism, enabling flexible synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and textual prompts. Specifically, masked guidance employs a region-aware masking mechanism combined with pixel-wise channel concatenation to preserve appearance features of multiple subjects along the channel dimension. This design preserves identity consistency and maintains the capabilities of the pre-trained backbone, without requiring any architectural changes. To mitigate subject confusion, we introduce a subject disentanglement mechanism which injects the semantic values of each subject derived from the text condition into its corresponding visual region. Additionally, we establish a four-stage data pipeline to construct diverse training pairs, effectively alleviating copy-paste artifacts. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that MAGREF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for scalable, controllable, and high-fidelity any-reference video synthesis.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled tool-augmented agents capable of solving complex real-world tasks through step-by-step reasoning. However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or multimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess tool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo, an agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing tasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by tool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a wide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster assessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation analysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site analysis. Queries are grounded in satellite or aerial imagery, including both optical RGB and SAR data, and require agents to reason through a diverse toolset. We implement a ReAct-style interaction loop and evaluate both open and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5) on 486 structured agentic tasks with 1,773 expert-verified reasoning steps. The benchmark reports both step-wise execution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable disparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models. ThinkGeo provides the first extensive testbed for evaluating how tool-enabled LLMs handle spatial reasoning in remote sensing.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their proficiency in fine-grained video motion understanding remains critically limited. They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA, the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset. All the code and annotations will be publicly available.

Abstract: Recent diffusion models have advanced image editing by improving fidelity and controllability across creative and personalized applications. However, multi-object scenes remain challenging, as reliable control over object categories, counts, and spatial layout is difficult to achieve. For that, we first study quantity and layout consistent image editing, abbreviated as QL-Edit, which targets control of object quantity and spatial layout in multi-object scenes. Then, we present IMAGHarmony, a straightforward framework featuring a plug-and-play harmony aware (HA) module that fuses perception semantics while modeling object counts and locations, resulting in accurate edits and strong structural consistency. We further observe that diffusion models are sensitive to the choice of initial noise and tend to prefer certain noise patterns. Based on this finding, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that selects semantically aligned initial noise through vision and language matching, thereby further improving generation stability and layout consistency in multiple object editing. To support evaluation, we develop HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a diverse range of quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony outperforms prior methods in both structural alignment and semantic accuracy, utilizing only 200 training images and 10.6M of trainable parameters. Code, models, and data are available at https://github.com/muzishen/IMAGHarmony.

Abstract: In continual instruction tuning (CIT) scenarios, where new instruction tuning data continuously arrive in an online streaming manner, training delays from large-scale data significantly hinder real-time adaptation. Data selection can mitigate this overhead, but existing strategies often rely on pretrained reference models, which are impractical in CIT setups since future data are unknown. Recent reference model-free online sample selection methods address this, but typically select a fixed number of samples per batch (e.g., top-k), making them vulnerable to distribution shifts where informativeness varies across batches. To address these limitations, we propose OASIS, an adaptive online sample selection approach for CIT that (1) selects informative samples by estimating each sample's informativeness relative to all previously seen data, beyond batch-level constraints, and (2) minimizes informative redundancy of selected samples through iterative selection score updates. Experiments on various large foundation models show that OASIS, using only 25 percent of the data, achieves comparable performance to full-data training and outperforms the state-of-the-art sampling methods.

Abstract: The ability to infer what others are looking at is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI interaction. We characterized this skill in 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs) and human participants (N = 65) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and variability. We found that 94 of the 111 VLMs were not better than random guessing, while humans achieved near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs respond with each choice almost equally frequently. Are they randomly guessing? At least for five top-tier VLMs, their performance was above chance, declined with increasing task difficulty, but barely varied across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral patterns cannot be explained by considering VLMs as random guessers. Instead, they likely utilize head orientation but not eye appearance to infer gaze direction, such that their performance is imperfect, subject to the task difficulty, but robust to superficial perceptual variations. This suggests that VLMs, lacking effective gaze inference skills, have yet to become technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential remains.

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need. Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

Abstract: Developing reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable reasoning skills, we propose a novel post-training method, Visual Game Learning (ViGaL), where MLLMs develop generalizable reasoning skills through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple games like Snake significantly enhances the downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, on multi-discipline questions like MMMU and on 3D spatial reasoning benchmarks like VSI-Bench, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models post-trained on benchmark-oriented multimodal reasoning data, while preserving the model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest that multimodal reasoning can emerge from gameplay, pointing to a promising strategy of designing surrogate tasks for RL post-training.

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

Abstract: Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with varying object and camera motions. We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) deblurring models on our dataset and observe significant performance degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and generalizable deblurring models.

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

<title>Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information and global context, effectively mitigating interference from category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

<title>VisionTS++: Cross-Modal Time Series Foundation Model with Continual Pre-trained Vision Backbones</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have indicated that vision models pre-trained on images can serve as time series foundation models (TSFMs) by reformulating time series forecasting (TSF) as image reconstruction. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three discrepancies: (1) the data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) the multivariate-forecasting gap between fixed RGB-three-channel vision models and time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) the probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic outputs of vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisonTS++, a TSFM based on continual pre-training of a vision model on large-scale time series. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) vision-model-based filtering to identify high-quality sequences to stabilize pre-training and mitigate modality gap; (2) colorized multivariate conversion, encoding multivariate series as multi-subfigure RGB images to enhance cross-variate modeling; (3) multi-quantile forecasting, using parallel reconstruction heads to generate quantile forecasts without parametric assumptions. Experiments show that VisionTS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution forecasting, outperforming specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in GIFT-Eval benchmark which comprises 23 datasets across 7 domains. Our work demonstrates that with appropriate adaptation, vision models can effectively generalize to TSF, thus advancing the pursuit of universal TSFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/VisionTSpp.

<title>Q-CLIP: Unleashing the Power of Vision-Language Models for Video Quality Assessment through Unified Cross-Modal Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics); (2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to assist in long-sequence video storytelling by efficiently translating ideas into visual narratives. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle--Explore, Examine, and Enhanc--to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief idea description, MAViS enables users to rapidly explore diverse visual storytelling and creative directions for sequential video generation by efficiently producing high-quality, complete long-sequence videos. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first 3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full 3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics, scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11 clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10) dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and auditory inputs to build and update episodic and semantic memories, gradually accumulating world knowledge. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal manner, enabling deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment. Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn reasoning and retrieves relevant memories to complete tasks. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal agents, we develop M3-Bench, a long-video question answering benchmark comprising 100 newly recorded robot-perspective videos (M3-Bench-robot) and 920 diverse web-sourced videos (M3-Bench-web). We annotate QA pairs designed to test capabilities essential for agent applications, such as person understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances multimodal agents toward more human-like long-term memory and provides insights for their practical design.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and normalization schemes of reconstruction targets for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth observation data. Based on our findings, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel adaptation of the Masked Autoencoder with optimized fusion mechanisms and a normalization scheme that incorporates a spectral prior as a self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets in both intra- and cross-dataset settings, MAESTRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal dynamics, while also remaining competitive on others.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems, limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation (UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and effectiveness.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms, whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models. Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20% for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget' some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant, this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more OOD.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO.

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a multi-modal (multimodal) model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design, which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions, including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients, the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

<title>DiffEye: Diffusion-Based Continuous Eye-Tracking Data Generation Conditioned on Natural Images</title>

Abstract: Numerous models have been developed for scanpath and saliency prediction, which are typically trained on scanpaths, which model eye movement as a sequence of discrete fixation points connected by saccades, while the rich information contained in the raw trajectories is often discarded. Moreover, most existing approaches fail to capture the variability observed among human subjects viewing the same image. They generally predict a single scanpath of fixed, pre-defined length, which conflicts with the inherent diversity and stochastic nature of real-world visual attention. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEye, a diffusion-based training framework designed to model continuous and diverse eye movement trajectories during free viewing of natural images. Our method builds on a diffusion model conditioned on visual stimuli and introduces a novel component, namely Corresponding Positional Embedding (CPE), which aligns spatial gaze information with the patch-based semantic features of the visual input. By leveraging raw eye-tracking trajectories rather than relying on scanpaths, DiffEye captures the inherent variability in human gaze behavior and generates high-quality, realistic eye movement patterns, despite being trained on a comparatively small dataset. The generated trajectories can also be converted into scanpaths and saliency maps, resulting in outputs that more accurately reflect the distribution of human visual attention. DiffEye is the first method to tackle this task on natural images using a diffusion model while fully leveraging the richness of raw eye-tracking data. Our extensive evaluation shows that DiffEye not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in scanpath generation but also enables, for the first time, the generation of continuous eye movement trajectories.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found in https://github.com/iamsnaping/ProDA.git

<title>HIVTP: A Training-Free Method to Improve VLMs Efficiency via Hierarchical Visual Token Pruning Using Middle-Layer-Based Importance Score</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance. Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the 1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks. Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher inference efficiency.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for training a neural network for image classification to reduce input data dynamically, in order to reduce the costs of training a neural network model. As Deep Learning tasks become more popular, their computational complexity increases, leading to more intricate algorithms and models which have longer runtimes and require more input data. The result is a greater cost on time, hardware, and environmental resources. By using data reduction techniques, we reduce the amount of work performed, and therefore the environmental impact of AI techniques, and with dynamic data reduction we show that accuracy may be maintained while reducing runtime by up to 50%, and reducing carbon emission proportionally.

Abstract: Visual actionable affordance has emerged as a transformative approach in robotics, focusing on perceiving interaction areas prior to manipulation. Traditional methods rely on pixel sampling to identify successful interaction samples or processing pointclouds for affordance mapping. However, these approaches are computationally intensive and struggle to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments. This paper introduces ManipGPT, a framework designed to predict optimal interaction areas for articulated objects using a large pre-trained vision transformer (ViT). We create a dataset of 9.9k simulated and real images to bridge the visual sim-to-real gap and enhance real-world applicability. By fine-tuning the vision transformer on this small dataset, we significantly improve part-level affordance segmentation, adapting the model's in-context segmentation capabilities to robot manipulation scenarios. This enables effective manipulation across simulated and real-world environments by generating part-level affordance masks, paired with an impedance adaptation policy, sufficiently eliminating the need for complex datasets or perception systems.

<title>SiLVR: Scalable Lidar-Visual Radiance Field Reconstruction with Uncertainty Quantification</title>

arXiv:2502.02657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality reconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic texture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key contribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to evaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction. In this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual texture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be identified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM system which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is particularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain artefacts due to limited observations. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres.

Abstract: Category-selective regions in the human brain-such as the fusiform face area (FFA), extrastriate body area (EBA), parahippocampal place area (PPA), and visual word form area (VWFA)-support high-level visual recognition. Here, we investigate whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit analogous category-selective neurons and how these representations are shaped by language experience. Using an fMRI-inspired functional localizer approach, we identified face-, body-, place-, and word-selective neurons in deep networks presented with category images and scrambled controls. Both the purely visual ResNet and a linguistically supervised Lang-Learned ResNet contained category-selective neurons that increased in proportion across layers. However, compared to the vision-only model, the Lang-Learned ResNet showed a greater number but lower specificity of category-selective neurons, along with reduced spatial localization and attenuated activation strength-indicating a shift toward more distributed, semantically aligned coding. These effects were replicated in the large-scale vision-language model CLIP. Together, our findings reveal that language experience systematically reorganizes visual category representations in ANNs, providing a computational parallel to how linguistic context may shape categorical organization in the human brain.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to fMRI-based visual image reconstruction using a subject-agnostic common representation space. We show that the brain signals of the subjects can be aligned in this common space during training to form a semantically aligned common brain. This is leveraged to demonstrate that aligning subject-specific lightweight modules to a reference subject is significantly more efficient than traditional end-to-end training methods. Our approach excels in low-data scenarios. We evaluate our methods on different datasets, demonstrating that the common space is subject and dataset-agnostic.

<title>Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization of Large Multimodal Models by Adversarial Negative Mining</title>

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly segmentation. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly segmentation, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection. The source code used in this study is publicly available at: https://github.com/iai-rs/mambo.

Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN. Source Code: https://github.com/basiralab/FireGNN

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments, facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway automation.

Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating structured texts but struggle with the nuanced storytelling and emotional depth required in movie scripts. To address this gap, a dataset called CML-Dataset was created, comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup Language (CML). Three pivotal dimensions for quality assessment in scripts were identified: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). A benchmark called CML-Bench was proposed, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions to evaluate script quality. Additionally, a prompting strategy named CML-Instruction was introduced to guide LLMs in generating more structured and cinematically sound scripts. Experiments showed that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction produced higher-quality screenplays aligned with human preferences. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed, high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions. CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

<div> Keywords: video classification, spammer detection, user behavior, UVSD model, representation learning

Summary:
User behavior is transformed into video frames using a novel UVSD model inspired by video classification technology. The user pixelization algorithm quantifies user stances as RGB pixels, while a behavior2image algorithm converts user behavior subspace into frame images using representation learning. The model constructs user behavior videos based on temporal features and employs a video classification algorithm to identify spammers. Experiments on WEIBO and TWITTER datasets demonstrate the superiority of the UVSD model in detecting spammers compared to existing methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e., WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
This study introduces the concept of uncertainty quantification in surface landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) classification using deep learning and Monte Carlo Dropout. The integration of MC Dropout into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture aims to provide a metric for prediction reliability, especially in challenging conditions such as noisy and adversarially perturbed images. The experimental results on simulated datasets showcase the model's ability to flag unreliable predictions, highlighting the importance of uncertainty quantification in demining operations.

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks, leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust and reliable models for practical applications.

<div> Keywords: imaging modalities, intravascular imaging, CCTA, coronary models, multimodars <br />
<br />
Summary: 
Combining imaging modalities such as intravascular imaging and CCTA is crucial for creating accurate 3D coronary models. While intravascular imaging provides high resolution, it lacks whole-vessel context, which is offered by CCTA. However, CCTA can suffer from limited resolution and artefacts. Previous methods have fused intravascular and CCTA data, but there was a need for a flexible toolkit optimized for multi-state analysis and reproducibility. The multimodars package addresses this need with deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact data model centered around NumPy, and an optimized Rust backend for scalable and reproducible experiments. This package can handle inputs in CSV or NumPy format, including those generated by the AIVUS-CAA software. <div>

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

<div> benchmarking, physical simulation, vision-language models, physics reasoning, diagnostic subtests

Summary:
- Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) were evaluated on three physical simulation datasets to assess their ability in predicting outcomes and hypothesizing about alternative situations.
- Diagnostic subtests were designed to separate perception and physics reasoning skills, with the expectation that stronger performance in these areas would lead to better evaluation accuracy.
- Weak correlations were observed between perception and physics reasoning skills and performance in predictive or counterfactual evaluation tasks.
- Current VLMs struggle to combine perceptual and physics skills into a cohesive understanding of causality.
- The study highlights the need for architectures that tightly integrate perception and reasoning in vision-language models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and reasoning more tightly.

<div> Keywords: Spiking Neural Networks, Neuromorphic hardware, Self-distillation framework, Rate-based backpropagation, High-performance training

Summary: 
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are energy-efficient due to sparse activation patterns but conventional training methods like BPTT have drawbacks. A new self-distillation framework optimized with rate-based backpropagation aims to enhance SNN training within limited resources. Intermediate SNN layer firing rates are projected onto lightweight ANN branches for optimization. Decoupling the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components ensures only reliable knowledge guides model optimization. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet show reduced training complexity and high-performance SNN training. The code is available on GitHub for reproducibility. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However, conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation. Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN training. Our code is available at https://github.com/Intelli-Chip-Lab/enhanced-self-distillation-framework-for-snn.

<div> Keywords: Cutaneous malignancies, AI integration, heterogeneous ensemble, language model capabilities, patient-centered education

Summary: 
Cutaneous malignancies necessitate early detection, but current diagnostics are hindered by variability and access issues. This study introduces a novel framework for dermatological AI diagnostics that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. Firstly, a diverse ensemble of convolutional neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives and flags uncertain cases for specialist review. Secondly, language model capabilities are integrated directly into the diagnostic workflow, generating structured reports with precise lesion characterization and patient-centric education. This integration aims to improve diagnostic reliability and communication barriers, bridging the gap for impactful AI implementation in dermatology. The framework offers enhanced diagnostic precision, supports patient education, and aims to improve early intervention rates for skin lesions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review -- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

Summary:<br />
The study aims to improve the detection of gravitational waves by classifying glitches in LIGO data using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The researchers trained a pre-trained ViT-B/32 model on a combined dataset from the Gravity Spy project and two additional noise classes from the LIGO O3a run. The model achieved a high classification efficiency of 92.26%, indicating the potential of ViT in accurately distinguishing transient noise events. By expanding the classification to include 22 existing classes and the additional noise classes, the study addresses the challenges posed by transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data. The findings suggest that the ViT model can enhance the accuracy of gravitational wave detection and contribute to more effective classification of noise events in gravitational wave signals. <div>

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by effectively distinguishing transient noise.

<div> Keywords: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, mask-based representation, object-agnostic cues, dense rewards, sim-to-real transfer

Summary:<br />
Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) aims to enable agents to learn diverse objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL hinges on the choice of goal representation, with existing methods facing challenges such as poor generalization and slow convergence. In this work, a mask-based representation system is proposed, providing object-agnostic visual cues to agents for efficient learning and superior generalization. By processing masks, dense rewards can be generated without the need for error-prone distance calculations. Through learning with ground truth masks in simulation, the method achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on both training and unseen test objects. This approach enables high-accuracy pick-up tasks without positional information of the target and can be applied to sim-to-real transfer tasks using pretrained object detection models. <div>

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast, existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask generation.

Summary: 
This study introduces a GAN-based superresolution method to enhance low-resolution full-disk H$\alpha$ solar images from GONG to achieve high-resolution quality comparable to BBSO/GST observations. The model utilizes Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator and carefully aligns image pairs for effective reconstruction.

The average MSE is 467.15, RMSE is 21.59, and CC is 0.7794. However, slight misalignments between image pairs affect quantitative performance, prompting future work on alignment refinement and dataset expansion for enhanced reconstruction quality. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope (BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE) of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC) of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

Summary:  
ChainMPQ is a new method designed to improve relational inference in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by addressing relation hallucinations. It uses subject and object keywords from questions to enhance image regions and constructs multi-perspective questions focusing on the subject, object, and relation components of a relationship. By sequentially inputting these questions to the model, with supporting textual and visual memories guiding the process, ChainMPQ reduces relation hallucinations and improves relational reasoning in LVLMs. Experiments on various LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ChainMPQ, with ablation studies confirming the importance of its three core modules. This training-free method shows promise in enhancing the reliability of LVLMs in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ (Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions. It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations, while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core modules.

Summary:
MobilePicasso is a novel system designed for efficient high-resolution image editing on resource-constrained devices. It consists of three stages: conducting image editing at a standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, using latent projection for pixel space transformation, and upscaling the edited image latent to higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling. A user study with 46 participants showed that MobilePicasso enhances image quality by 18-48% and reduces hallucinations by 14-51% compared to existing methods. It also achieves significant speed-ups, up to 55.8 times, and minimal runtime memory increase, just 9% over previous approaches. Surprisingly, MobilePicasso's on-device runtime outperforms a server-based high-resolution image editing model running on an A100 GPU. <div>
arXiv:2510.06295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage. MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling. Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g., up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g., a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

Summary: 
This thesis focuses on implementing an AI-based Gaze Tracking system using RGBD images and a Transformer module for feature fusion. A new dataset is created for training AI models as existing datasets lack depth information or suitable labels for Gaze Angle Estimation. The model architecture is based on a Generative Adversarial Network for removing depth map artifacts and extracting head pose features. Results show that using a Transformer module leads to a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm on the ShanghaiTechGaze+ dataset, while using no pre-trained GAN module reduces the error to 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with an MLP further improves the error to 26.9mm. Results are consistent across three datasets, with the model achieving a mean angular error of 3.59° on the ETH-XGaze dataset. The study provides insights into the effectiveness of different model configurations in estimating the gaze direction of individuals in real-time scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D) information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean angular error of 2.04{\deg}.

arXiv:2510.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function. Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25 m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints, achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000 parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure. The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing climate.

<div> Keywords: face recognition, unconstrained environments, transfer learning, recognizability assessment, explainability<br />
<br />
Summary: TransFIRA introduces a lightweight and annotation-free framework for face recognition in challenging environments. By defining recognizability through class-center similarity and angular separation, it provides a decision-boundary-aligned criterion for filtering and weighting. The framework utilizes a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy, achieving high verification accuracy and improved correlation with true recognizability. It extends beyond faces to include body recognition assessment and encoder-grounded explainability, showcasing how factors like degradations and subject-specific traits impact recognizability. TransFIRA delivers state-of-the-art results on face recognition and robust performance on body recognition, demonstrating its accuracy, interpretability, and extensibility across modalities. This geometry-driven framework significantly advances face image quality assessment in terms of accuracy, explainability, and scope.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video, and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur, illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS), yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels, heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and scope.

Summary:
The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) utilizes a network of roadside traffic cameras to monitor road conditions, a process that currently involves manual observation. To improve efficiency, machine learning models were trained on camera images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. The models, including convolutional neural networks and random forests, were trained on a dataset of ~22,000 labeled camera images representing six road surface conditions. The goal was to prioritize model generalizability to meet the needs of NYSDOT decision-makers. The weather-related road surface condition model achieved an accuracy of 81.5% on unseen cameras, demonstrating the potential for automated classification of road conditions to aid in operational decision-making. <div>

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events. However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry, poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on completely unseen cameras.

Summary:
The article introduces a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) designed to enhance thermal images captured by low-cost cameras. These images often suffer from low resolution and fixed pattern noise. TDiff leverages local distortions by training on small thermal patches, enabling the restoration of full-resolution images through denoising and blending overlapping patches. This framework is the first to model a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring tasks demonstrate strong results on both simulated and real thermal data, showcasing TDiff as a comprehensive restoration pipeline. <div>

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge, this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration pipeline.

Summary: <br />
Superpixels have been used in image simplification to improve computational efficiency, but their irregular distribution can complicate deep learning. The new SIGRID data structure combines color and shape information of superpixels to reduce input dimensionality for segmentation tasks. Tested on four benchmark datasets with convolutional segmentation architectures, SIGRIDs outperform or match pixel-level representations while accelerating model training. This balance between accuracy and computational efficiency demonstrates the effectiveness of SIGRIDs. <div>

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures, undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality. We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Text2Interact, human-human interactions, spatiotemporal coupling, interaction data synthesizer, fine-grained modeling

Summary: 
The article introduces the Text2Interact framework for modeling realistic human-human interactions accurately aligned with text descriptions. It addresses the challenges of limited two-person training data and collapsed text-to-interaction modeling. The framework includes two key components: InterCompose, a scalable synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns interaction descriptions with single-person motion priors, and InterActor, a text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning for fine-grained modeling. InterCompose uses a neural motion evaluator to filter weak samples, expanding interaction coverage without additional data capture. InterActor preserves token-level cues and incorporates an adaptive interaction loss to emphasize contextually relevant joint pairs for improved coupling and physical plausibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate increased motion diversity, fidelity, and generalization even in out-of-distribution scenarios, validated through user studies. Code and models will be released for reproducibility. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise, text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions, trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate reproducibility.

Summary: 
Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of frames that convey semantic and contextual information. KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework, utilizes captions and visual context to estimate frame importance by considering semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual impact. STACFP generates diverse frame candidates for long videos. Together, these modules achieve significant frame reduction and outperform standard encoders on various datasets. Emphasizing multimodal alignment between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient video understanding without explicit summarization. By leveraging KeyScore and STACFP, accurate video analysis for retrieval, captioning, and video-language reasoning can be achieved, enhancing the overall efficiency of video processing tasks. <div>

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval, captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together, these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g., "does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences, given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP, with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively. Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a 19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

Summary: 
The article introduces TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework for limited-angle electron tomography in Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Unlike traditional deep learning approaches, TEMDiff is trained on volumetric FIB-SEM data using a simulator to learn structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. Operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff enforces consistency across slices without additional regularization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality on simulated datasets. The trained TEMDiff model also demonstrates strong generalization to real-world TEM tilts with different conditions, accurately recovering structures from narrow tilt ranges as small as 8 degrees with 2-degree increments, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework. Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or fine-tuning.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces VUGEN, a framework for efficient and high-quality image generation that leverages Vision-Language Models' visual understanding priors. VUGEN transforms the VLM's high-dimensional native vision encoder latent space into a lower-dimensional distribution while preserving visual information. The model is trained to sample within this reduced latent space, aligning with its visual understanding capabilities. A pixel decoder then converts the generated latents back into the image space. The approach outperforms existing methods, with a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder yielding comparable or better results than complex latent diffusion decoders. Extensive experiments show that VUGEN improves DPG Bench and FID scores on the COCO dataset while maintaining the VLM's original understanding capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2510.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms, leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations, or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally, a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space. We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding capabilities.

<div> interpretability, deep neural networks, cluster paths, decision processes, biases

Summary:
Cluster paths offer a method for interpreting the decision processes of deep neural networks by clustering activations at specific layers and representing inputs as sequences of cluster IDs. Four metrics are introduced to assess cluster paths: path complexity, weighted-path purity, decision-alignment faithfulness, and path agreement. In experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets, cluster paths successfully identify shortcuts and maintain faithfulness and stability under perturbations. Extending to a Vision Transformer model pretrained on ImageNet, concept paths derived from prompting a language model are explored. Additionally, cluster paths prove to be effective as an out-of-distribution detector, flagging anomalous samples before generating predictions. The method uncovers visual concepts such as color palettes and textures across different network depths, demonstrating scalability to large vision models while providing concise and human-readable explanations. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load), weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness (predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task, they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes, textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and human-readable explanations.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a new framework for image super-resolution that combines graph modeling with computational efficiency. The core idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components using the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB) to capture diverse relational patterns and feature interactions. The Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) then integrates these representations, using adaptive weighting and fusion to construct a comprehensive representation. Additionally, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) helps retain salient features, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments, HSNet has shown state-of-the-art performance in image super-resolution, balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code for HSNet will be publicly available.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components. First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features, SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated, uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12 annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii) empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly available at https://fz-rit.github.io/through-the-lidars-eye/.

<div> Domain adaptation, deep learning, CT scanner, artifact, classification accuracy
Summary:
- Deep learning models trained on specific image distributions may fail when applied to new distributions with different artifacts, impacting classification accuracy.
- Domain adaptation using domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) can maintain classification performance on images with new artifacts without requiring labeled data for the new distribution.
- Baseline models trained only on clean images lack generalization to images with artifacts, while traditional augmentation approaches with other distortion types do not improve performance on unseen artifact domains.
- DANN approach successfully maintains high classification accuracy on images with ring artifacts, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain adaptation for artifact robustness.
- The domain-adapted model achieved comparable classification performance on ring artifact test data to models explicitly trained with labeled artifact images, and also showed unexpected generalization to uniform noise. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative, this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

<div> Keywords: visual tokenization, autoregressive generation, MingTok, continuous latent space, vision-language tasks 

Summary: 
MingTok introduces a new approach to visual tokenization by employing a continuous latent space, aiming to improve semantic expressiveness and capability in vision-language tasks. The three-stage architecture of MingTok involves low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction, catering to both understanding and generation tasks. Ming-UniVision utilizes a unified continuous visual representation to support various vision-language tasks under a single autoregressive prediction paradigm. This approach allows for multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding, generation, and editing. Empirical results demonstrate that using a unified continuous visual representation yields state-of-the-art performance in both understanding and generation domains. The release of inference code and model weights aims to benefit the research community in advancing unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction. Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding, generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model weights are released to benefit community.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain normalization methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xutianyue/BeerLaNet.

Summary:
The scarcity of well-annotated datasets in machine learning poses challenges for creating robust models. Synthetic data generated through simulations and generative models has emerged as a solution to enhance dataset diversity and improve model performance. However, evaluating the quality of synthetic data is crucial for model success. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM), a metric designed to assess data quality for object detection tasks without the need for model training to converge. SDQM showed a strong correlation with mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of the YOLOv11 model, outperforming previous metrics. Additionally, SDQM provides actionable insights for improving dataset quality and minimizing the need for costly iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for evaluating synthetic data and can help address resource constraints in object detection tasks.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data. The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution, enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at https://github.com/ayushzenith/SDQM

<br /><br />Summary: 
MRI is crucial for diagnosis but limited by long scan times. Fast MRI reconstruction with deep learning techniques is promising.

arXiv:2510.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Multilingual Experts (MuEx) is proposed to improve speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) across multiple languages. It utilizes a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture that leverages phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries, bridging audio and video modalities. By extracting audio and video features as phonemes and visemes, linguistic differences and dataset bias are minimized. The Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align) ensures robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes for effective audiovisual synchronization. A Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) containing 12 languages provides a diverse training and evaluation dataset. The results show that MuEx outperforms existing models in multilingual TFS, demonstrating superior performance across all languages in MTFB and achieving effective zero-shot generalization to untrained languages. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12 diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional training.

Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers. Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance, enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack, the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines, highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field.

Summary: 
The article introduces StaR-KVQA, a method for Implicit-Knowledge Visual Question Answering (IK-KVQA) using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Instead of relying on external retrieval, StaR-KVQA supervises structured reasoning traces to improve model interpretability and performance. By constructing path-grounded reasoning traces and fine-tuning with structured self-distillation, StaR-KVQA achieves higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA and demonstrates robust cross-domain generalization. This approach does not require external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases, making inference a single autoregressive pass. StaR-KVQA addresses the limitations of MLLMs in reasoning over implicit knowledge and produces transparent and verifiable explanations, leading to improved performance in IK-KVQA tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications, and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases (KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

Summary: <br />
Industrial surface defect detection is crucial for maintaining product quality, but faces challenges in detecting diverse defects. AutoNAD is introduced as an automated neural architecture design framework that addresses intraclass differences and interclass similarities in surface defect detection. By combining convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons, AutoNAD can effectively capture both local variations and long-range context. The framework includes a cross weight sharing strategy for efficient training and a searchable multi-level feature aggregation module to enhance multi-scale feature learning. AutoNAD also considers runtime efficiency by incorporating a latency-aware prior to select efficient architectures. The framework is validated on industrial defect datasets and applied in a defect imaging and detection platform, showcasing its effectiveness for real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1) using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

A novel multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation network (Mlpfseg) is proposed to address challenges in effective integration of these modalities. The network includes a feature completion module to enhance fusion by addressing density mismatch between point clouds and image pixels, and a depth perception module to improve segmentation of occluded objects.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps, enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Summary: 
SCas4D is a novel cascaded optimization framework designed for dynamic scene modeling, tracking, and novel-view synthesis. The framework efficiently captures accurate deformations in dynamic scenes by leveraging structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

<div> Evaluation Framework, Large Language Models, Historical OCR, Contamination Control, Model Selection

Summary:
The article introduces a new evaluation methodology for Large Language Model (LLM)-based historical Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the digital humanities field. Traditional OCR metrics are insufficient for capturing temporal biases and period-specific errors, crucial for historical corpus creation. The proposed methodology includes novel metrics such as Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), as well as protocols for contamination control and stability testing. Evaluation of 12 multimodal LLMs on 18th-century Russian Civil font texts reveals that the Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR but exhibit over-historicization by inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Interestingly, post-OCR correction actually degrades performance rather than improving it. This methodology provides guidelines for digital humanities practitioners in selecting suitable models and assessing the quality of historical corpus digitization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus digitization.

Summary:
DeRainMamba is a novel approach for single image deraining that combines a Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv) to improve the visual quality of derained images and support downstream vision tasks. FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from high-frequency image details, ensuring a balance between rain removal and detail preservation. MDPConv enhances local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient features and efficiently fusing convolution branches. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that DeRainMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM metrics while requiring fewer parameters and lower computational costs.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation. MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

Summary: 
OBS-Diff introduces a one-shot pruning framework for large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, overcoming the challenge of their high computational cost. The framework, based on Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) principles, supports various sparsity levels, including unstructured and semi-structured pruning. To align with the iterative nature of diffusion models, timestep-aware Hessian construction is used, giving more importance to earlier timesteps. A group-wise sequential pruning strategy is employed for efficient calibration. Experiments demonstrate that OBS-Diff achieves superior pruning results, offering accelerated inference without significant loss in visual quality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme, assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality.

<div> Keywords: supervised Gaussian denoisers, histogram matching, noise transformation, denoising performance, out-of-distribution noises

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to improve the generalization of supervised Gaussian denoisers when faced with out-of-distribution noise. By utilizing histogram matching techniques, arbitrary noise can be transformed to approximate a target Gaussian distribution with known intensity. A mutually reinforcing cycle is established between noise transformation and denoising, progressively refining the noise and enhancing the denoising performance. Specific noise complexities are addressed, including signal-dependent noise, channel-related noise, and spatial correlation. Through these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser can effectively handle various out-of-distribution noises, both synthetic and real-world. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of the proposed method. <div>

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising. This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise, intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises, including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: high-resolution land-cover mapping, weak labels, Deep Multiple Instance Learning, Positive-Unlabeled Learning, multi-label classification

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery and weak low-resolution reference data. The proposed method leverages Deep Multiple Instance Learning to train pixel-level classifiers and predict low-resolution labels, allowing for implicit learning of high-resolution labels. By framing the Multiple Instance Learning problem in a multi-class and multi-label setting, the classifier is trained with a Positive-Unlabeled Learning strategy. Experimental results on the IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework compared to standard training strategies. The approach utilizes flexible pooling layers to connect pixel semantics in high-resolution imagery with low-resolution reference labels, enabling accurate land-cover mapping despite limited training data quality. The method proves particularly useful in scenarios where abundant weak labels are available, showcasing its potential for improving accuracy and efficiency in land-cover classification tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning (DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to standard training strategies.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Test-Time Rewarding for Vision Language Models (TTRV), a method that enhances vision language understanding without the need for labeled data. TTRV adapts the model on the fly at inference time in a test-time reinforcement learning framework. By rewarding the model based on output frequency and controlling output diversity, TTRV achieves significant improvements in object recognition and visual question answering tasks across 16 datasets. Notably, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B outperforms GPT-4o in image recognition and remains competitive in VQA. The method demonstrates the potential of test-time reinforcement learning for Vision Language Models, even in data-constrained scenarios, achieving notable improvements with minimal labeled data. <div>
arXiv:2510.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work, we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data. Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%, respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

<br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach for extreme amodal detection, specifically focusing on the sub-problem of face detection. Unlike existing methods that rely on image sequences or generative models, the proposed method is designed for single-image tasks. By leveraging contextual cues within the image, a heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector is utilized to efficiently predict out-of-frame regions. The approach utilizes a selective coarse-to-fine decoder to infer the presence of unseen faces. The results of this method demonstrate superior performance compared to less efficient generative approaches, showcasing the effectiveness of the sample-free strategy in extreme amodal detection tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

<title>VA-Adapter: Adapting Ultrasound Foundation Model to Echocardiography Probe Guidance</title>

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently, ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval, where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage, preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints will be made publicly available shortly.

arXiv:2510.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However, existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts. Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code is available \href{https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleKeeper}{here}.

arXiv:2510.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i) velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints. Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event camera operation in real-world settings.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos, supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting. To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization (MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task, Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time, without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST) which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving onboard AI for remote sensing.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally, many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster.

Abstract: Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel method applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung infection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image patches during training. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, RALO CXR and Per-COVID-19 CT, our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models. The results emphasize the critical role of data augmentation and gated attention in improving both robustness and predictive accuracy. This approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized treatment planning.

<title>Label-frugal satellite image change detection with generative virtual exemplar learning</title>

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images. The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning. The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling. These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative methods.

<title>IAR2: Improving Autoregressive Visual Generation with Semantic-Detail Associated Token Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06928</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence, improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

<title>OBJVanish: Physically Realizable Text-to-3D Adv. Generation of LiDAR-Invisible Objects</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06952</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However, existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity, and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation (Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate 3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications.

<title>Generating Surface for Text-to-3D using 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06967</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task. Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper, we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

<title>Learning Global Representation from Queries for Vectorized HD Map Construction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches, particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose \textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD \textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit, global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines.

<title>Addressing the ID-Matching Challenge in Long Video Captioning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1) enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15% to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track different individuals in the captions of long videos.

<title>No MoCap Needed: Post-Training Motion Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning using Only Textual Prompts</title>

arXiv:2510.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper, we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i) intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning 47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<title>U-Bench: A Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking</title>

arXiv:2510.07041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric, U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary, U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements, and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/coret/

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model, DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

arXiv:2510.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations, relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based explanations that are more interpretable.

arXiv:2510.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

<title>Validation of Various Normalization Methods for Brain Tumor Segmentation: Can Federated Learning Overcome This Heterogeneity?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however, it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of 92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical applications.

<title>Graph Conditioned Diffusion for Controllable Histopathology Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors, making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions.

<title>Are We Using the Right Benchmark: An Evaluation Framework for Visual Token Compression Methods</title>

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at https://github.com/Chenfei-Liao/VTC-Bench.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis.

<title>Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning, but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated: ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and 1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2 achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to 512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned 86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation. Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically, these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care settings.

<title>EigenScore: OOD Detection using Covariance in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress, recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift, leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance, with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing diffusion-based methods often fail.

<title>GenPilot: A Multi-Agent System for Test-Time Prompt Optimization in Image Generation</title>

arXiv:2510.07217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness. Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts. Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration. Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is available at https://github.com/27yw/GenPilot.

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers 164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director, orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning.

<title>Evaluating Fundus-Specific Foundation Models for Diabetic Macular Edema Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07277</link>

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning, suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently. In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions, ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility, capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility, the full code is released on \href{https://github.com/inzamamulDU/SpecGuard_ICCV_2025}{\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{GitHub}}}.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers. Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation. We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

<title>WristWorld: Generating Wrist-Views via 4D World Models for Robotic Manipulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views. Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views. WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation, which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.

<title>Pixel-Perfect Depth with Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers</title>

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details. Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e. non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions, quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision. This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students, scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e. gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access, program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social implications.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring, video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts. By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models, we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object, enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation. Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet framework.

Our approach integrates multimodal representations from large language models, video encoders, audio models, and vision-language models, combining both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned variants. To improve performance, we enhanced textual inputs with detailed transcripts and summaries, and we explored stimulus-tuning and fine-tuning strategies for language and vision models. Predictions from individual models were combined using stacked regression, yielding solid results. Our submission, under the team name Seinfeld, ranked 10th. We make all code and resources publicly available, contributing to ongoing efforts in developing multimodal encoding models for brain activity.

Abstract: Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a primary cause of drug-resistant epilepsy and is difficult to detect in brain {magnetic resonance imaging} (MRI) due to the subtle and small-scale nature of its lesions. Accurate segmentation of FCD regions in 3D multimodal brain MRI images is essential for effective surgical planning and treatment. However, this task remains highly challenging due to the limited availability of annotated FCD datasets, the extremely small size and weak contrast of FCD lesions, the complexity of handling 3D multimodal inputs, and the need for output smoothness and anatomical consistency, which is often not addressed by standard voxel-wise loss functions. This paper presents a new framework for segmenting FCD regions in 3D brain MRI images. We adopt state-of-the-art transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture and introduce a novel loss function combining Dice loss with an anisotropic {Total Variation} (TV) term. This integration encourages spatial smoothness and reduces false positive clusters without relying on post-processing. The framework is evaluated on a public FCD dataset with 85 epilepsy patients and demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and consistency compared to standard loss formulations. The model with the proposed TV loss shows an 11.9\% improvement on the Dice coefficient and 13.3\% higher precision over the baseline model. Moreover, the number of false positive clusters is reduced by 61.6%

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and OpenCLIP, can encode and reflect stereotypical associations between medical professions and demographic attributes learned from web-scale data. We present an evaluation protocol for healthcare settings that quantifies associated biases and assesses their operational risk. Our methodology (i) defines a taxonomy spanning clinicians and allied healthcare roles (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, technician), (ii) curates a profession-aware prompt suite to probe model behavior, and (iii) benchmarks demographic skew against a balanced face corpus. Empirically, we observe consistent demographic biases across multiple roles and vision models. Our work highlights the importance of bias identification in critical domains such as healthcare as AI-enabled hiring and workforce analytics can have downstream implications for equity, compliance, and patient trust.

Abstract: Incremental brain tumor segmentation is critical for models that must adapt to evolving clinical datasets without retraining on all prior data. However, catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge, remains a major obstacle. Recent incremental learning frameworks with knowledge distillation partially mitigate forgetting but rely heavily on generative replay or auxiliary storage. Meanwhile, diffusion models have proven effective for refining tumor segmentations, but have not been explored in incremental learning contexts. We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the first framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental learning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate synthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new tasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge distillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention. Experiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff consistently outperforms prior methods. It achieves the highest Dice scores of 95.8\%, 94.9\%, and 94.6\%, along with the lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7 mm, and 4.9 mm, respectively. These results indicate that SER-Diff not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also delivers more accurate and anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets.

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

<title>Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model-Based Robust MR Image Reconstruction from Highly Undersampled Data</title>

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical tool in modern medical diagnostics, yet its prolonged acquisition time remains a critical limitation, especially in time-sensitive clinical scenarios. While undersampling strategies can accelerate image acquisition, they often result in image artifacts and degraded quality. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for reconstructing high-fidelity images from undersampled data by learning powerful image priors; however, most existing approaches either (i) rely on unsupervised score functions without paired supervision or (ii) apply data consistency only as a post-processing step. In this work, we introduce a conditional denoising diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction, which differs from prior methods by embedding the measurement model directly into every reverse diffusion step and training the model on paired undersampled-ground truth data. This hybrid design bridges generative flexibility with explicit enforcement of MRI physics. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning and diffusion-based methods in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS, with LPIPS capturing perceptual improvements more faithfully. These results demonstrate that integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism, establishing a principled and practical advance toward robust, accelerated MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational studies.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world scenarios, where transparent obstacles present significant challenges to reliable navigation and mapping. These materials pose a unique problem for traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments, demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.

Abstract: Aortic aneurysm disease ranks consistently in the top 20 causes of death in the U.S. population. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal bulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults. From the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on the aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be obtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite Element Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be calculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure model. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture risk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited due to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient specific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it time consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and computational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and incompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was successfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA library and the FEA DNN integration framework. By incorporating the FEA functionalities within PyTorch FEA and applying the principle of static determinacy, we reduced the FEA based stress computation time to approximately three minutes per case. Moreover, by integrating DNN and FEA through the PyTorch FEA library, our approach further decreases the computation time to only a few seconds per case. This work focuses on overcoming the first barrier through the development of an end to end deep neural network capable of generating patient specific finite element meshes of the aorta directly from 3D CT images.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained increasing attention for their superior energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, their security aspects, particularly under backdoor attacks, have received limited attention. Existing defense methods developed for ANNs perform poorly or can be easily bypassed in SNNs due to their event-driven and temporal dependencies. This paper identifies the key blockers that hinder traditional backdoor defenses in SNNs and proposes an unsupervised post-training detection framework, Temporal Membrane Potential Backdoor Detection (TMPBD), to overcome these challenges. TMPBD leverages the maximum margin statistics of temporal membrane potential (TMP) in the final spiking layer to detect target labels without any attack knowledge or data access. We further introduce a robust mitigation mechanism, Neural Dendrites Suppression Backdoor Mitigation (NDSBM), which clamps dendritic connections between early convolutional layers to suppress malicious neurons while preserving benign behaviors, guided by TMP extracted from a small, clean, unlabeled dataset. Extensive experiments on multiple neuromorphic benchmarks and state-of-the-art input-aware dynamic trigger attacks demonstrate that TMPBD achieves 100% detection accuracy, while NDSBM reduces the attack success rate from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when combined with detection, without degrading clean accuracy.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws. However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN. Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We will release code and checkpoints publicly.

<title>The False Promise of Zero-Shot Super-Resolution in Machine-Learned Operators</title>

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution (i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust multi-resolution generalization.

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information. While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic, and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene, simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the capability for robust decision-making.

Abstract: We present a quantitative evaluation to understand the effect of zero-shot large-language model (LLMs) and prompting uses on chart reading tasks. We asked LLMs to answer 107 visualization questions to compare inference accuracies between the agentic GPT-5 and multimodal GPT-4V, for difficult image instances, where GPT-4V failed to produce correct answers. Our results show that model architecture dominates the inference accuracy: GPT5 largely improved accuracy, while prompt variants yielded only small effects.

While our scheme increases the cost of one-time preprocessing steps, such as circuit compilation and generating trusted setup, our approach is, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that is deployable on the native EVM smart contracts without overwhelming proof size and verification overheads.

Abstract: Capturing and rendering three-dimensional (3D) objects in real time remain a significant challenge, yet hold substantial potential for applications in augmented reality, digital twin systems, remote collaboration and prototyping. We present an end-to-end pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) to enable rapid acquisition and interactive rendering of real-world objects using a mobile device, cloud processing and a local computer. Users scan an object with a smartphone video, upload it for automated 3D reconstruction, and visualize it interactively in Unity at an average of 150 frames per second (fps) on a laptop. The system integrates mobile capture, cloud-based 3D GS and Unity rendering to support real-time telepresence. Our experiments show that the pipeline processes scans in approximately 10 minutes on a graphics processing unit (GPU) achieving real-time rendering on the laptop.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering. SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$ larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B. Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any degradation in helpfulness performance.

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering. SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights, confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world effectiveness. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/spherepaircc/SpherePairCC/tree/main}{our repository}.

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9 for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach, High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based methods while significantly reducing training costs.

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and \emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i) replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet, iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors. Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in low-bit quantization settings.

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition, thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and structural variations.

Abstract: Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification, complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design, TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: This extended abstract describes our solution for the Traffic4Cast Challenge 2019. The task requires modeling both fine-grained (pixel-level) and coarse (region-level) spatial structure while preserving temporal relationships across long sequences. Building on Conv-LSTM ideas, we introduce a tile-aware, cascaded-memory Conv-LSTM augmented with cross-frame additive attention and a memory-flexible training scheme: frames are sampled per spatial tile so the model learns tile-local dynamics and per-tile memory cells can be updated sparsely, paged, or compressed to scale to large maps. We provide a compact theoretical analysis (tight softmax/attention Lipschitz bound and a tiling error lower bound) explaining stability and the memory-accuracy tradeoffs, and empirically demonstrate improved scalability and competitive forecasting performance on large-scale traffic heatmaps.

Abstract: Advertisement video editing aims to automatically edit advertising videos into shorter videos while retaining coherent content and crucial information conveyed by advertisers. It mainly contains two stages: video segmentation and segment assemblage. The existing method performs well at video segmentation stages but suffers from the problems of dependencies on extra cumbersome models and poor performance at the segment assemblage stage. To address these problems, we propose M-SAN (Multi-modal Segment Assemblage Network) which can perform efficient and coherent segment assemblage task end-to-end. It utilizes multi-modal representation extracted from the segments and follows the Encoder-Decoder Ptr-Net framework with the Attention mechanism. Importance-coherence reward is designed for training M-SAN. We experiment on the Ads-1k dataset with 1000+ videos under rich ad scenarios collected from advertisers. To evaluate the methods, we propose a unified metric, Imp-Coh@Time, which comprehensively assesses the importance, coherence, and duration of the outputs at the same time. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance than random selection and the previous method on the metric. Ablation experiments further verify that multi-modal representation and importance-coherence reward significantly improve the performance. Ads-1k dataset is available at: https://github.com/yunlong10/Ads-1k

Abstract: Our winning entry for the CVPR 2023 Generic Event Boundary Captioning (GEBC) competition is detailed in this paper. Unlike conventional video captioning tasks, GEBC demands that the captioning model possess an understanding of immediate changes in status around the designated video boundary, making it a difficult task. This paper proposes an effective model LLMVA-GEBC (Large Language Model with Video Adapter for Generic Event Boundary Captioning): (1) We utilize a pretrained LLM for generating human-like captions with high quality. (2) To adapt the model to the GEBC task, we take the video Q-former as an adapter and train it with the frozen visual feature extractors and LLM. Our proposed method achieved a 76.14 score on the test set and won the first place in the challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjr2000/LLMVA-GEBC .

Abstract: This article introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel approach that aims to empirically assess if given data was used during the training of AI/ML models. Specifically, we propose two MINT architectures designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an Audited Model is exposed to data used during its training process. These architectures are based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental framework focuses on the challenging task of Face Recognition, considering three state-of-the-art Face Recognition systems. Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising over 22 million face images in total. Different experimental scenarios are considered depending on the context of the AI model to test. Our proposed MINT approach achieves promising results, with up to 90\% accuracy, indicating the potential to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. The proposed MINT approach can serve to enforce privacy and fairness in several AI applications, e.g., revealing if sensitive or private data was used for training or tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).

<title>Unlocking Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to condense datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While diffusion models now lead all generative benchmarks, current distillation methods avoid them and rely instead on GANs or autoencoders, or, at best, sampling from a fixed diffusion prior. This trend arises because naive backpropagation through the long denoising chain leads to vanishing gradients, which prevents effective synthetic sample optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models (LD3M), the first method to learn gradient-based distilled latents and class embeddings end-to-end through a pre-trained latent diffusion model. A linearly decaying skip connection, injected from the initial noisy state into every reverse step, preserves the gradient signal across dozens of timesteps without requiring diffusion weight fine-tuning. Across multiple ImageNet subsets at 128x128 and 256x256, LD3M improves downstream accuracy by up to 4.8 percentage points (1 IPC) and 4.2 points (10 IPC) over the prior state-of-the-art. The code for LD3M is provided at https://github.com/Brian-Moser/prune_and_distill.

Abstract: The self-supervised contrastive learning strategy has attracted considerable attention due to its exceptional ability in representation learning. However, current contrastive learning tends to learn global coarse-grained representations of the image that benefit generic object recognition, whereas such coarse-grained features are insufficient for fine-grained visual recognition. In this paper, we incorporate subtle local fine-grained feature learning into global self-supervised contrastive learning through a pure self-supervised global-local fine-grained contrastive learning framework. Specifically, a novel pretext task called local discrimination (LoDisc) is proposed to explicitly supervise the self-supervised model's focus toward local pivotal regions, which are captured by a simple but effective location-wise mask sampling strategy. We show that the LoDisc pretext task can effectively enhance fine-grained clues in important local regions and that the global-local framework further refines the fine-grained feature representations of images. Extensive experimental results on different fine-grained object recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to a decent improvement in different evaluation settings. The proposed method is also effective for general object recognition tasks.

<title>Empowering LLMs with Pseudo-Untrimmed Videos for Audio-Visual Temporal Understanding</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language and multimodal domains. By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual events in videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos. Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.

Abstract: Numerous applications require algorithms that can align partially overlapping point sets while maintaining invariance to geometric transformations (e.g., similarity, affine, rigid). This paper introduces a novel global optimization method for this task by minimizing the objective function of the Robust Point Matching (RPM) algorithm. We first reveal that the original RPM objective is a cubic polynomial. Through a concise variable substitution, we transform this objective into a quadratic function. By leveraging the convex envelope of bilinear monomials, we derive a tight lower bound for this quadratic function. This lower bound problem conveniently and efficiently decomposes into two parts: a standard linear assignment problem (solvable in polynomial time) and a low-dimensional convex quadratic program. Furthermore, we devise a specialized Branch-and-Bound (BnB) algorithm that branches exclusively on the transformation parameters, which significantly accelerates convergence by confining the search space. Experiments on 2D and 3D synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, exhibits superior robustness to non-rigid deformations, positional noise, and outliers, particularly in scenarios where outliers are distinct from inliers.

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of various defense mechanisms in response to the rise in adversarial attacks on IQA. We systematically evaluate 25 defense strategies, including adversarial purification, adversarial training, and certified robustness methods. We applied 14 adversarial attack algorithms of various types in both non-adaptive and adaptive settings and tested these defenses against them. We analyze the differences between defenses and their applicability to IQA tasks, considering that they should preserve IQA scores and image quality. The proposed benchmark aims to guide future developments and accepts submissions of new methods, with the latest results available online: https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/iqa-defenses.html.

<title>CaRDiff: Video Salient Object Ranking Chain of Thought Reasoning for Saliency Prediction with Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Video saliency prediction aims to identify the regions in a video that attract human attention and gaze, driven by bottom-up features from the video and top-down processes like memory and cognition. Among these top-down influences, language plays a crucial role in guiding attention by shaping how visual information is interpreted. Existing methods primarily focus on modeling perceptual information while neglecting the reasoning process facilitated by language, where ranking cues are crucial outcomes of this process and practical guidance for saliency prediction. In this paper, we propose CaRDiff (Caption, Rank, and generate with Diffusion), a framework that imitates the process by integrating a multimodal large language model (MLLM), a grounding module, and a diffusion model, to enhance video saliency prediction. Specifically, we introduce a novel prompting method VSOR-CoT (Video Salient Object Ranking Chain of Thought), which utilizes an MLLM with a grounding module to caption video content and infer salient objects along with their rankings and positions. This process derives ranking maps that can be sufficiently leveraged by the diffusion model to decode the saliency maps for the given video accurately. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of VSOR-CoT in improving the performance of video saliency prediction. The proposed CaRDiff performs better than state-of-the-art models on the MVS dataset and demonstrates cross-dataset capabilities on the DHF1k dataset through zero-shot evaluation.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled significant progress in multimodal understanding, expanding their capacity to analyze video content. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for MLLMs primarily focus on abstract video comprehension, lacking a detailed assessment of their ability to understand video compositions, the nuanced interpretation of how visual elements combine and interact within highly compiled video contexts. We introduce VidComposition, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the video composition understanding capabilities of MLLMs using carefully curated compiled videos and cinematic-level annotations. VidComposition includes 982 videos with 1706 multiple-choice questions, covering various compositional aspects such as camera movement, angle, shot size, narrative structure, character actions and emotions, etc. Our comprehensive evaluation of 33 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveals a significant performance gap between human and model capabilities. This highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex, compiled video compositions and offers insights into areas for further improvement.

Abstract: With the wide application of deep neural network models in various computer vision tasks, there has been a proliferation of adversarial example generation strategies aimed at deeply exploring model security. However, existing adversarial training defense models, which rely on single or limited types of attacks under a one-time learning process, struggle to adapt to the dynamic and evolving nature of attack methods. Therefore, to achieve defense performance improvements for models in long-term applications, we propose a novel Sustainable Self-Evolution Adversarial Training (SSEAT) framework. Specifically, we introduce a continual adversarial defense pipeline to realize learning from various kinds of adversarial examples across multiple stages. Additionally, to address the issue of model catastrophic forgetting caused by continual learning from ongoing novel attacks, we propose an adversarial data replay module to better select more diverse and key relearning data. Furthermore, we design a consistency regularization strategy to encourage current defense models to learn more from previously trained ones, guiding them to retain more past knowledge and maintain accuracy on clean samples. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed SSEAT defense method, which demonstrates superior defense performance and classification accuracy compared to competitors.Code is available at https://github.com/aup520/SSEAT

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved notable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an intelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric. The codes, data, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ShawnHuang497/MedPLIB.

Abstract: Traditional Celluloid (Cel) Animation production pipeline encompasses multiple essential steps, including storyboarding, layout design, keyframe animation, inbetweening, and colorization, which demand substantial manual effort, technical expertise, and significant time investment. These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, challenges like visual consistency, stylistic coherence, and ethical considerations persist. Additionally, this paper explores future directions and advancements in AI-assisted animation.

Abstract: Concept erasure techniques have recently gained significant attention for their potential to remove unwanted concepts from text-to-image models. While these methods often demonstrate promising results in controlled settings, their robustness in real-world applications and suitability for deployment remain uncertain. In this work, we (1) identify a critical gap in evaluating sanitized models, particularly in assessing their performance across diverse concept dimensions, and (2) systematically analyze the failure modes of text-to-image models post-erasure. We focus on the unintended consequences of concept removal on non-target concepts across different levels of interconnected relationships including visually similar, binomial, and semantically related concepts. To address this, we introduce EraseBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating post-erasure performance. EraseBench includes over 100 curated concepts, targeted evaluation prompts, and a robust set of metrics to assess both effectiveness and side effects of erasure. Our findings reveal a phenomenon of concept entanglement, where erasure leads to unintended suppression of non-target concepts, causing spillover degradation that manifests as distortions and a decline in generation quality.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples that inputs with small, carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification, making adversarial attacks an essential tool for robustness evaluation. Existing black-box attacks fall into three categories: query-only, transfer-only, and query-and-transfer, and vary in perturbation pattern and optimization strategy. However, no prior method jointly achieves query-and-transfer guidance, pixel-wise sparsity, and training-free direct optimization, leaving a gap between black-box flexibility and white-box precision. We present GreedyPixel, a new attack framework that fills this gap by combining a surrogate-derived pixel priority map with greedy, per-pixel optimization refined by query feedback. This design reduces the exponential brute-force search space to a tractable linear procedure, guarantees monotonic loss decrease and convergence to a coordinate-wise optimum, and concentrates perturbations on robust, semantically meaningful pixels to improve perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet under both white-box and black-box settings demonstrate that GreedyPixel achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and produces visually imperceptible perturbations. Our results show that GreedyPixel bridges the precision gap between white-box and black-box attacks and provides a practical framework for fine-grained robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Automated diagnostic systems (ADS) have shown significant potential in the early detection of polyps during endoscopic examinations, thereby reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer. However, due to high annotation costs and strict privacy concerns, acquiring high-quality endoscopic images poses a considerable challenge in the development of ADS. Despite recent advancements in generating synthetic images for dataset expansion, existing endoscopic image generation algorithms failed to accurately generate the details of polyp boundary regions and typically required medical priors to specify plausible locations and shapes of polyps, which limited the realism and diversity of the generated images. To address these limitations, we present Polyp-Gen, the first full-automatic diffusion-based endoscopic image generation framework. Specifically, we devise a spatial-aware diffusion training scheme with a lesion-guided loss to enhance the structural context of polyp boundary regions. Moreover, to capture medical priors for the localization of potential polyp areas, we introduce a hierarchical retrieval-based sampling strategy to match similar fine-grained spatial features. In this way, our Polyp-Gen can generate realistic and diverse endoscopic images for building reliable ADS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art generation quality, and the synthetic images can improve the downstream polyp detection task. Additionally, our Polyp-Gen has shown remarkable zero-shot generalizability on other datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/Polyp-Gen.

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations.

Abstract: Automatic extraction of chemical structures from scientific literature plays a crucial role in accelerating research across fields ranging from drug discovery to materials science. Patent documents, in particular, contain molecular information in visual form, which is often inaccessible through traditional text-based searches. In this work, we introduce SubGrapher, a method for the visual fingerprinting of chemical structure images. Unlike conventional Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) models that attempt to reconstruct full molecular graphs, SubGrapher focuses on extracting molecular fingerprints directly from chemical structure images. Using learning-based instance segmentation, SubGrapher identifies functional groups and carbon backbones, constructing a substructure-based fingerprint that enables chemical structure retrieval. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art OCSR and fingerprinting methods, demonstrating superior retrieval performance and robustness across diverse molecular depictions. The dataset, models, and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. However, most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly utilize the underlying clustering structure in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. To this end, we present $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$, which provides efficient training strategies by conditioning on the features extracted from data using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on synthetic data from multi-modal distributions and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$ exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models by adopting pretrained lightweight latent variable models. Beyond natural images, we consider generative modeling of spatial fields stemming from physical processes. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competing approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features, which adds interpretability to the generation process.

Abstract: In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.

<title>PolyPose: Deformable 2D/3D Registration via Polyrigid Transformations</title>

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-rays, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail. Additional visualizations, tutorials, and code are available at https://polypose.csail.mit.edu.

Abstract: Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems. Resources available at: https://yunlong10.github.io/MMPerspective/

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 17 mAP!

Abstract: Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL) methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects' super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However, their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts. MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared with existing Slot Attention variants.

Abstract: The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.41 years on an established dataset, and further achieves 4.91 and 4.99 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.82 years on the Faces Dataset. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs. Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring, Sintel, and KITTI benchmarks, achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x faster than methods with similar performance.

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has recently seen remarkable success, granting users with the ability to create high-quality images through the use of text. However, contemporary methods face challenges in capturing the precise semantics conveyed by complex multi-object prompts. Consequently, many works have sought to mitigate such semantic misalignments, typically via inference-time schemes that modify the attention layers of the denoising networks. However, prior work has mostly utilized coarse metrics, such as the cosine similarity between text and image CLIP embeddings, or human evaluations, which are challenging to conduct on a larger-scale. In this work, we perform a case study on colors -- a fundamental attribute commonly associated with objects in text prompts, which offer a rich test bed for rigorous evaluation. Our analysis reveals that pretrained models struggle to generate images that faithfully reflect multiple color attributes-far more so than with single-color prompts-and that neither inference-time techniques nor existing editing methods reliably resolve these semantic misalignments. Accordingly, we introduce a dedicated image editing technique, mitigating the issue of multi-object semantic alignment for prompts containing multiple colors. We demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts performance over a wide range of metrics, considering images generated by various text-to-image diffusion-based techniques.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work, we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon acceptance.

We introduce a new, annotated dataset collected with the NICO robotic platform. We evaluate four state-of-the-art gaze estimation models. The evaluation shows that the angular errors are close to those reported on general-purpose benchmarks. However, when expressed in terms of distance in the shared workspace the best median error is 16.48 cm quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS.

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper, we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences: 66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Abstract: Meta-learning is an effective method to handle imbalanced and noisy-label learning, but it depends on a validation set containing randomly selected, manually labelled and balanced distributed samples. The random selection and manual labelling and balancing of this validation set is not only sub-optimal for meta-learning, but it also scales poorly with the number of classes. Hence, recent meta-learning papers have proposed ad-hoc heuristics to automatically build and label this validation set, but these heuristics are still sub-optimal for meta-learning. In this paper, we analyse the meta-learning algorithm and propose new criteria to characterise the utility of the validation set, based on: 1) the informativeness of the validation set; 2) the class distribution balance of the set; and 3) the correctness of the labels of the set. Furthermore, we propose a new imbalanced noisy-label meta-learning (INOLML) algorithm that automatically builds a validation set by maximising its utility using the criteria above. Our method shows significant improvements over previous meta-learning approaches and sets the new state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have drawn much attention for their high energy efficiency and recent advances in classification performance. However, unlike traditional deep learning, the robustness of SNNs to adversarial examples remains underexplored. This work advances the adversarial attack side of SNNs and makes three major contributions. First, we show that successful white-box attacks on SNNs strongly depend on the surrogate gradient estimation technique, even for adversarially trained models. Second, using the best single surrogate gradient estimator, we study the transferability of adversarial examples between SNNs and state-of-the-art architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNNs. Our analysis reveals two major gaps: no existing white-box attack leverages multiple surrogate estimators, and no single attack effectively fools both SNNs and non-SNN models simultaneously. Third, we propose the Mixed Dynamic Spiking Estimation (MDSE) attack, which dynamically combines multiple surrogate gradients to overcome these gaps. MDSE produces adversarial examples that fool both SNN and non-SNN models, achieving up to 91.4% higher effectiveness on SNN/ViT ensembles and a 3x boost on adversarially trained SNN ensembles over Auto-PGD. Experiments span three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and nineteen classifiers, and we will release code and models upon publication.

Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the most effective techniques for regularizing deep learning models and improving their recognition performance in a variety of tasks and domains. However, this holds for standard in-domain settings, in which the training and test data follow the same distribution. For the out-of-domain case, where the test data follow a different and unknown distribution, the best recipe for data augmentation is unclear. In this paper, we show that for out-of-domain and domain generalization settings, data augmentation can provide a conspicuous and robust improvement in performance. To do that, we propose a simple training procedure: (i) use uniform sampling on standard data augmentation transformations; (ii) increase the strength transformations to account for the higher data variance expected when working out-of-domain, and (iii) devise a new reward function to reject extreme transformations that can harm the training. With this procedure, our data augmentation scheme achieves a level of accuracy that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods on benchmark domain generalization datasets.

Abstract: We present a new general framework for segmentation of MRI scans based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA), offering several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. The pipeline proceeds in three steps, first identifying the whole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a distinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the various components of the segmentation. Unlike most prior TDA uses in medical image segmentation, which are typically embedded within deep networks, our approach is a standalone method tailored to MRI. A key ingredient is the localization of representative cycles from the persistence diagram, which enables interpretable mappings from topological features to anatomical components. In particular, the method offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for large annotated datasets. Its modular design makes it adaptable to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We validate the framework on three applications: glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a sphere is to be detected; myocardium in cardiac MRI, forming a cylinder; and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are circles. We compare our method with established supervised and unsupervised baselines.

<title>A Deep Learning System for Rapid and Accurate Warning of Acute Aortic Syndrome on Non-contrast CT in China</title>

Abstract: The accurate and timely diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes (AAS) in patients presenting with acute chest pain remains a clinical challenge. Aortic CT angiography (CTA) is the imaging protocol of choice in patients with suspected AAS. However, due to economic and workflow constraints in China, the majority of suspected patients initially undergo non-contrast CT as the initial imaging testing, and CTA is reserved for those at higher risk. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence-based warning system, iAorta, using non-contrast CT for AAS identification in China, which demonstrates remarkably high accuracy and provides clinicians with interpretable warnings. iAorta was evaluated through a comprehensive step-wise study. In the multi-center retrospective study (n = 20,750), iAorta achieved a mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the large-scale real-world study (n = 137,525), iAorta demonstrated consistently high performance across various non-contrast CT protocols, achieving a sensitivity of 0.913-0.942 and a specificity of 0.991-0.993. In the prospective comparative study (n = 13,846), iAorta demonstrated the capability to significantly shorten the time to correct diagnostic pathway. For the prospective pilot deployment that we conducted, iAorta correctly identified 21 out of 22 patients with AAS among 15,584 consecutive patients presenting with acute chest pain and under non-contrast CT protocol in the emergency department (ED) and enabled the average diagnostic time of these 21 AAS positive patients to be 102.1 (75-133) mins. Last, the iAorta can help avoid delayed or missed diagnosis of AAS in settings where non-contrast CT remains the unavoidable the initial or only imaging test in resource-constrained regions and in patients who cannot or did not receive intravenous contrast.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have significantly advanced tasks such as multimodal question answering by grounding responses in external text and images. This grounding improves factuality, reduces hallucination, and extends reasoning beyond parametric knowledge. However, this reliance on external knowledge poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where adversaries deliberately inject adversarial multimodal content into external knowledge bases to steer model toward generating incorrect or even harmful responses. To expose such vulnerabilities, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, the first framework to systematically design knowledge poisoning in multimodal RAG. We introduce two complementary attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which implants targeted multimodal misinformation to manipulate specific queries, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA), which inserts a single adversarial knowledge to broadly disrupt reasoning and induce nonsensical responses across all queries. Comprehensive experiments across tasks, models, and access settings show that LPA achieves targeted manipulation with attack success rates of up to 56%, while GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single adversarial knowledge injection. Our results reveal the fragility of multimodal RAG and highlight the urgent need for defenses against knowledge poisoning.

Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication. Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.

<title>Optimizing Breast Cancer Detection in Mammograms: A Comprehensive Study of Transfer Learning, Resolution Reduction, and Multi-View Classification</title>

Abstract: Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, remains central to the early detection of breast cancer. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled increasingly sophisticated computer-aided diagnostic methods, evolving from patch-based classifiers to whole-image approaches and then to multi-view architectures that jointly analyze complementary projections. Despite this progress, several critical questions remain unanswered. In this study, we systematically investigate these issues by addressing five key research questions: (1) the role of patch classifiers in performance, (2) the transferability of natural-image-trained backbones, (3) the advantages of learn-to-resize over conventional downscaling, (4) the contribution of multi-view integration, and (5) the robustness of findings across varying image quality. Beyond benchmarking, our experiments demonstrate clear performance gains over prior work. For the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we improved single-view AUC from 0.8153 to 0.8343, and multiple-view AUC from 0.8483 to 0.8658. Using a new comparative method, we also observed a 0.0217 AUC increase when extending from single to multiple-view analysis. On the complete VinDr-Mammo dataset, the multiple-view approach further improved results, achieving a 0.0492 AUC increase over single view and reaching 0.8511 AUC overall. These results establish new state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing clear evidence of the advantages of multi-view architectures for mammogram interpretation. Beyond performance, our analysis offers principled insights into model design and transfer learning strategies, contributing to the development of more accurate and reliable breast cancer screening tools. The inference code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/dpetrini/multiple-view.

<title>BIM-Constrained Optimization for Accurate Localization and Deviation Correction in Construction Monitoring</title>

arXiv:2504.17693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) applications for construction monitoring rely on real-time environmental tracking to visualize architectural elements. However, construction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking methods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation, leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This paper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges. Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built" detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned" architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the initial manual alignment by the user.

Abstract: Face recognition poses serious privacy risks due to its reliance on sensitive and immutable biometric data. While modern systems mitigate privacy risks by mapping facial images to embeddings (commonly regarded as privacy-preserving), model inversion attacks reveal that identity information can still be recovered, exposing critical vulnerabilities. However, existing attacks are often computationally expensive and lack generalization, especially those requiring target-specific training. Even training-free approaches suffer from limited identity controllability, hindering faithful reconstruction of nuanced or unseen identities. In this work, we propose DiffMI, the first diffusion-driven, training-free model inversion attack. DiffMI introduces a novel pipeline combining robust latent code initialization, a ranked adversarial refinement strategy, and a statistically grounded, confidence-aware optimization objective. DiffMI applies directly to unseen target identities and face recognition models, offering greater adaptability than training-dependent approaches while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our method achieves 84.42%--92.87% attack success rates against inversion-resilient systems and outperforms the best prior training-free GAN-based approach by 4.01%--9.82%. The implementation is available at https://github.com/azrealwang/DiffMI.

<title>MoRE-Brain: Routed Mixture of Experts for Interpretable and Generalizable Cross-Subject fMRI Visual Decoding</title>

arXiv:2505.15946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However, current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction. MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers. Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently, MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/MoRE-Brain.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios, particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs), extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However, these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs. HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic modeling over arbitrarily long contexts, and a dynamic temporal scaling mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/hrlics/HoPE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

Abstract: Cognitive science research treats visual perception, the ability to understand and make sense of a visual input, as one of the early developmental signs of intelligence. Its TVPS-4 framework categorizes and tests human perception into seven skills such as visual discrimination, and form constancy. Do Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) match up to humans in basic perception? Even though there are many benchmarks that evaluate MLLMs on advanced reasoning and knowledge skills, there is limited research that focuses evaluation on simple perception. In response, we introduce Percept-V, a dataset containing 6000 program-generated uncontaminated images divided into 30 domains, where each domain tests one or more TVPS-4 skills. Our focus is on perception, so we make our domains quite simple and the reasoning and knowledge required for solving them are minimal. Since modern-day MLLMs can solve much more complex tasks, our a-priori expectation is that they will solve these domains very easily. Contrary to our belief, our experiments show a weak performance of SoTA proprietary and open-source MLLMs compared to very high human performance on Percept-V. We find that as number of objects in the image increases, performance goes down rather fast. Our experiments also identify the perception skills that are considerably harder for all models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare imaging has revolutionized diagnostic medicine and clinical decision-making processes. This work presents an intelligent multimodal framework for medical image analysis that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare diagnostics. The framework integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for automated tumor detection and clinical report generation across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. The system combines visual feature extraction with natural language processing to enable contextual image interpretation, incorporating coordinate verification mechanisms and probabilistic Gaussian modeling for anomaly distribution. Multi-layered visualization techniques generate detailed medical illustrations, overlay comparisons, and statistical representations to enhance clinical confidence, with location measurement achieving 80 pixels average deviation. Result processing utilizes precise prompt engineering and textual analysis to extract structured clinical information while maintaining interpretability. Experimental evaluations demonstrated high performance in anomaly detection across multiple modalities. The system features a user-friendly Gradio interface for clinical workflow integration and demonstrates zero-shot learning capabilities to reduce dependence on large datasets. This framework represents a significant advancement in automated diagnostic support and radiological workflow efficiency, though clinical validation and multi-center evaluation are necessary prior to widespread adoption.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.

Summary:
EvoQuality is a novel self-supervised framework for improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage without the need for human-annotated data. It adapts the principle of self-consistency to image quality assessment (IQA) by using pairwise majority voting to generate pseudo-labels for relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then used to create a fidelity reward that guides the model's evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality enhances the VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8% on PLCC across various IQA benchmarks. Surprisingly, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality outperforms state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models on 5 out of 7 benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in autonomously refining the VLM's perceptual capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities, their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.

To address this, Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT) uses cluster-specific parameters to align outputs with full-precision counterparts. CAT refines outputs without additional parameters or model fine-tuning. A novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT consistently outperforms prior methods on ImageNet-1K, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1 accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by over 3% as a plug-in.<br /><br />Summary: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces deep neural network complexity by quantizing values.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision (FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit). Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs, worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters, without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1 accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation alongside the publication of this paper.

<br />
Summary: Our study introduces the Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation in infrastructure inspection, addressing the scarcity of labeled data and the need to learn new defect categories efficiently. The framework includes an adaptive E-FPN encoder for multi-scale feature extraction, prototypical learning with masked average pooling for prototype generation, and attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local self-attention, and cross-attention. Experimental results demonstrate excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration achieving 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way classification testing. The self-attention mechanism significantly improves performance, providing a 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over baselines. This framework enables rapid response to new defect types with limited training data, leading to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical infrastructure systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well, the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3) attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being 8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical infrastructure systems.

<div> Keywords: Remote photoplethysmography, skin segmentation, heart rate monitoring, motion resistance, real-world applications

Summary: 
The article introduces a new technique for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) that focuses on prioritizing skin regions to enhance signal quality. This novel skin segmentation method can detect skin areas across the body, making it more resistant to movement while eliminating potential sources of interference like the mouth, eyes, and hair. The model is evaluated on existing datasets and a new dataset called SYNC-rPPG, showcasing its ability to capture heartbeats accurately even in challenging conditions such as talking and head rotation. The mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates remains low, outperforming other methods. Additionally, the model demonstrates high accuracy in detecting various skin tones, making it a promising option for real-world applications in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, and smart vehicle utilization. Overall, this technique shows significant potential for improving the accuracy and reliability of rPPG technology.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes. We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset, called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for real-world applications.

arXiv:2510.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, hallucinations, generation diversity, dynamic guidance, score function

Summary: 
Dynamic Guidance, a novel approach introduced in this work, aims to address the issue of hallucinations in diffusion models by selectively sharpening the score function along known artifact-causing directions. This approach targets the structural inconsistencies and out-of-support samples often generated by diffusion models, without sacrificing semantic interpolations that lead to generation diversity. By tackling hallucinations at generation time rather than relying on post-hoc filtering, Dynamic Guidance effectively reduces artifacts on both controlled and natural image datasets. This method significantly outperforms existing baselines, showcasing its potential to enhance the performance of diffusion models in generating high-quality samples with improved accuracy and validity. <div>
arXiv:2510.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

<div> cache-based acceleration, diffusion models, inference process, memory consumption, video generation

Summary:
The paper introduces training-free acceleration in video generation using diffusion models. By breaking down the inference process into encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, the authors identify memory surges in the latter two stages when using cache-based acceleration methods. To address this issue, they propose three stage-specific strategies: Asynchronous Cache Swapping, Feature chunk, and Slicing latents to decode. These strategies aim to reduce memory consumption without significantly increasing time overhead. The proposed approach improves inference speed, reduces memory usage, and maintains acceptable quality levels compared to the baseline. The code for the approach is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>
arXiv:2510.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper, we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage, while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range.

Summary:
This study explores the use of thermal imaging to recover past events from present observations. By leveraging the inherent warmth of humans compared to their surroundings, subtle interactions like sitting or touching leave residual heat traces that can be captured by thermal cameras. The proposed time-reversed reconstruction framework utilizes paired RGB and thermal images to reconstruct scene states from a few seconds earlier. This approach combines Visual-Language Models with a constrained diffusion process to ensure semantic and structural consistency in the reconstructed images. Experimental evaluations in controlled scenarios show the feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier. This research represents a significant step towards time-reversed imaging from thermal traces, with potential applications in forensics and scene analysis.

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging, operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras. This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier, providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a method for retrieving images using a compound query that combines object instance information from an image with a natural language description. The approach involves a mapping network that translates a local image embedding to a text token suitable for CLIP style text encoding. This method improves image retrieval performance on personalized benchmarks by utilizing a trainable mapping network (pi-map) with frozen CLIP text and image encoders. The training procedure for generating a text token only needs to be performed once for each object instance, streamlining the process. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing advancements in personalized image retrieval tasks. <div>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess personalized retrieval.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a framework called ArchitectHead for creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that allow continuous control over levels of detail (LOD). By parameterizing the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and using a UV feature field with multi-level learnable feature maps, the model can dynamically adjust the number of Gaussians for efficient rendering. The method achieves state-of-the-art quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. Even at the lowest LOD, where only 6.2% of the Gaussians are used, the quality degradation is moderate and the rendering speed improves significantly. This approach enables real-time rendering of 3D head avatars with adjustable LOD levels, balancing visual quality and rendering efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering. ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining. Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss +7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering speed nearly doubles.

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D 120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3% accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing, outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

Summary:  
Diffusion models are powerful generative models but lack an explicit low-dimensional latent space. A novel Riemannian metric is proposed on the noise space to capture the data manifold learned by diffusion models, encouraging geodesics to align with the data manifold. This metric leads to more natural and faithful image transitions compared to existing methods. The Jacobian of the score function guides the design of the metric, ensuring that paths in the noise space align with the data manifold for improved interpolation results. Experiments on image interpolation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metric in producing perceptually more natural transitions. The new metric offers a promising approach for exploring and utilizing the learned data manifold in diffusion models.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates). We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

<div> multimodal large language models, handwritten student classwork, mathematics education, Experiment A, Experiment B

Summary:
Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to an exploration of their potential in assessing and providing feedback on handwritten student math work. Two experiments were conducted to assess MLLM performance in this context. In Experiment A, MLLMs achieved high accuracy in grading arithmetic problems from Ghanaian middle school students but experienced occasional errors. In Experiment B, evaluating mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, MLLMs struggled to interpret the drawings directly but improved significantly when provided with human descriptions. The findings suggest that while MLLMs can analyze arithmetic work effectively, they face challenges in understanding student illustrations without additional context. This research highlights the potential of MLLMs in grading handwritten student work but also underscores the need for further development in visual interpretation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines 288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20 with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical illustrations.

<div> self-supervised learning, object recognition, motion understanding, Midway Network, natural videos  
Summary:  
Self-supervised learning methods have traditionally focused on either object recognition or motion understanding separately. The Midway Network introduced in this study is the first architecture to simultaneously learn visual representations for both from natural videos by incorporating latent dynamics modeling. By utilizing a top-down path for inferring motion latents and a dense prediction objective, Midway Network tackles the complexity of multi-object scenes in videos. Pretraining on large-scale datasets, Midway Network outperforms previous methods in semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks. Furthermore, its learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence, as demonstrated with a novel forward feature perturbation analysis method. The results highlight the effectiveness of Midway Network in jointly learning object recognition and motion understanding from unlabeled data.

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex, multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis method based on forward feature perturbation.

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance, and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships. Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem, integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance, while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

Summary:
CalibCLIP is a novel training-free method designed to address the limitations of existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) in text-driven image retrieval tasks. It introduces two key components: the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE) in the visual space and the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC) in the textual space. CVE helps to identify dominant tokens in visual features and dynamically suppress their representations, while DCC differentiates between general and discriminative concepts in the text query to enhance the differentiation among similar samples. The proposed method significantly improves the performance across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in calibrating the suppressive effect of dominant tokens and enhancing discriminative features in VLMs. The code for CalibCLIP is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics, dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this, we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space, we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP.

<div> Keywords: Autoregressive models, multimodal language, image generation, chain-of-thought reasoning, computational efficiency

Summary: 
ShortCoTI is a new optimization framework designed to streamline the process of generating images using autoregressive multimodal large language models. These models have become popular for image generation, but the use of chain-of-thought reasoning can lead to visual overthinking and unnecessary redundancy. ShortCoTI addresses this issue by encouraging more concise prompts, reducing the computational cost and potential contradictions in generated images. By incorporating a reward system based on task difficulty, ShortCoTI is able to significantly shorten prompt reasoning length while maintaining or even improving image quality metrics. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that the streamlined prompts produced by ShortCoTI are both concise and semantically rich, eliminating verbose explanations and repetitive refinements. Overall, ShortCoTI enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing the fidelity or visual appeal of the generated images. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images.

Summary:  
Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have been successful in training Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the development of HOI-R1, a model that explores the potential of language models in Human-object Interaction Detection (HOID) without relying on additional detection modules. HOI-R1 introduces an HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve the detection task through text alone. Results on the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 outperforms baseline accuracy by 2x with strong generalization capabilities. This approach reduces the complexity of traditional methods that rely on prior knowledge from Vision and Language Models (VLMs) to enhance interaction recognition, offering a promising direction for future HOID research and applications. The source code for HOI-R1 is accessible at https://github.com/cjw2021/HOI-R1.

arXiv:2510.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline with great generalization ability. The source code is available at https://github.com/cjw2021/HOI-R1.

<div> Efficient Control Model, autoregressive models, image generation, distributed architecture, attention layers
Summary:<br /><br />
The Efficient Control Model (ECM) is introduced as a new framework for image synthesis, offering a lightweight control module for spatially-conditioned generation. Using a distributed architecture with context-aware attention layers and a shared gated feed-forward network, the ECM efficiently introduces control signals via real-time generated tokens. The model focuses on early-stage generation to prioritize learning early control sequences, reducing computational costs by decreasing the number of training tokens per iteration. In addition, a temperature scheduling method during inference compensates for potential training inefficiencies for late-stage tokens. Experimental results on scale-based autoregressive models showcase the ECM's ability to achieve high-fidelity and diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while significantly improving training and inference efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2510.05610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore, recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

<div> Keywords: autoregressive models, point cloud generation, level-of-detail principle, ShapeNet, scalability potential 

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces PointNSP, a generative framework for autoregressive point cloud generation that improves upon existing diffusion-based approaches. The framework utilizes a coarse-to-fine approach inspired by the level-of-detail principle in shape modeling. By incorporating a next-scale prediction paradigm, PointNSP can preserve global shape structure at low resolutions and refine fine-grained geometry at higher scales. This multi-scale factorization aligns with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, allowing for rich intra-scale interactions without relying on fixed orderings. Experimental results on ShapeNet demonstrate that PointNSP achieves state-of-the-art generation quality within the autoregressive paradigm while also surpassing diffusion-based baselines in efficiency. Particularly in dense generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's scalability potential is highlighted. <div>
arXiv:2510.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry, consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Summary:
Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is crucial for diagnosing dry eye syndrome, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to the lack of annotated datasets. This paper introduces the Tear Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, a comprehensive dataset for tear film analysis. The dataset includes videos annotated with frame-level classification, Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area segmentation. A novel baseline segmentation model, TF-Net, is proposed, achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Benchmark performance on the TFM segmentation subset shows the effectiveness of TF-Net. Additionally, a real-time pipeline, TF-Collab, is designed to automate tear film analysis by leveraging models trained on multiple tasks of the TFM dataset. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of both TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a strong foundation for future research in ocular surface diagnostics. The code and TFM datasets are publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247 frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear', 'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research in ocular surface diagnostics.

Summary: <br />
InstaGeo is a new open-source framework designed to streamline the process of utilizing open-access multispectral imagery for geospatial applications. It addresses challenges such as automated data curation, model distillation for compact models, and seamless deployment as web-map applications. By using InstaGeo, researchers were able to reproduce datasets and train models with minimal accuracy loss compared to original models. The framework also enables the creation of state-of-the-art datasets, leading to significant improvements in crop segmentation accuracy. InstaGeo reduces the size of models and their carbon footprint, making them more sustainable for real-time Earth observation applications. This approach emphasizes the importance of data quality and practical, application-driven innovation in geospatial AI. <div>
arXiv:2510.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs) for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of -0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time, large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data quality and application-driven innovation.

Summary:
The study explores the reliance of state-of-the-art image forensics detectors on frequency-domain artifacts, particularly spectral peaks in synthetic image generation detection. By systematically analyzing the impact of removing spectral peaks on various detectors, the research challenges the common assumption that detectors fundamentally depend on these peaks. Additionally, a linear detector exclusively relying on frequency peaks is introduced, providing a transparent and interpretable baseline for comparison. The findings suggest that most detectors are not primarily reliant on spectral peaks, emphasizing the need for more transparent and reliable forensic tools in the field of image forensics. This research contributes to improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of image forensics tools, paving the way for enhanced reliability in detecting AI-generated images.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently, frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However, state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable forensic tools.

<div> Keywords: Deep metric learning, hyperbolic space, proxy-based losses, CHEST loss, state-of-the-art performance

Summary:
This paper introduces a new approach, the Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss, for deep metric learning in hyperbolic space. While traditional methods rely on pair-based or unsupervised regularization losses, the CHEST loss combines proxy-based losses in both hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces with a regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. By leveraging the strengths of both spaces, the proposed approach enhances accuracy and stability in learning. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the CHEST loss achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in deep metric learning. <div>
arXiv:2510.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points. Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand, supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space. However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

Summary: 
The study introduces two deep learning frameworks to address the challenges in diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP). The first framework, AHP-CADNet, utilizes ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to achieve accurate and interpretable automated diagnosis. It shows high accuracy rates ranging from 96.9% to 99.0% across classification tasks and low prediction errors for continuous variables. The second framework focuses on imputing missing data using a curriculum learning-based approach that progressively incorporates structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance diagnostic robustness. The imputation framework achieves high accuracy rates (93.46-99.78%) across all clinical variables, with significant improvements in clinical dependency modeling. The findings affirm the effectiveness of both frameworks in automated diagnosis and overcoming missing data challenges in clinical settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry; however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to 0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001). These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction, affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together. Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings, limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

<div> Weighted cross-modal attention mechanism, script-driven video summarization, multimodal, semantic similarity, video summarization datasets

Summary:
The study introduces SD-MVSum, a method for script-driven multimodal video summarization that considers both visual content and spoken script in videos. A weighted cross-modal attention mechanism models the dependence between script-video and script-transcript pairs by leveraging semantic similarity. Two large-scale datasets, S-VideoXum and MrHiSum, are extended for training and evaluating multimodal video summarization methods. Experimental results show the competitiveness of SD-MVSum against state-of-the-art approaches for both script-driven and generic video summarization. The method and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/IDT-ITI/SD-MVSum.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at: https://github.com/IDT-ITI/SD-MVSum.

<div> Keywords: liver cancer, histological subtyping, Whole Slide Images, TME, ARGUS <br />
Summary: <br />
Primary liver malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), are highly heterogeneous cancers with diverse prognoses. Current approaches to histological subtyping often overlook crucial features within Whole Slide Images (WSIs), such as the hierarchical pyramid structure and tumor microenvironment (TME). ARGUS, a novel framework, addresses this gap by capturing macro-meso-micro hierarchical information in the TME. It introduces a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level patterns and a Hierarchical Field-of-Views Alignment module to model hierarchical interactions in WSIs. The fusion of micro-geometry and FoVs features through Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy enhances the holistic representation of phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for clinical practice. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment (TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

Summary: 
The article introduces a unified training-free pipeline for realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a background scene. It addresses the challenges of determining the correct location and poses of the person, and performing high-quality personalization conditioned on the background. By leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, the method combines inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance to achieve affordance-aware global editing. The proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity, clothing, and body features from a single reference image. This approach stands out as the first to perform realistic human insertions into scenes in a training-free manner, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in both backgrounds and subjects. <div>

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity, clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in backgrounds and subjects.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on automated video editing for multicamera recordings of classical music concerts. It addresses the challenges of determining when to cut and how to cut in the editing process. A novel multimodal architecture is proposed for temporal segmentation, integrating audio signals, image embedding, and scalar temporal features through a convolutional-transformer pipeline. For spatial selection, an updated approach with a CLIP-based encoder and constrained distractor selection is introduced. A dataset was created using a pseudo-labeling approach, clustering raw video data into coherent shot segments. Results show that the models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points and achieving competitive visual shot selection. This work advances the state of the art in automated video editing for classical music concerts. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut. Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments. We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art in multimodal automated video editing.

The study investigates the impact of R. solani infection on the germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost, image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras captured images to analyze germination dynamics and growth over time. A novel image analysis pipeline was developed, integrating morphological and spatial features to identify and quantify individual seedlings accurately. The method's temporal integration enabled precise seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in complex scenarios with dense growth.

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost, image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups. The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

<div> Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning, Object-level encoding

Summary:
Recent advances in language models have shown great progress in reasoning and in-context learning, but vision models have lagged behind. The gap may be due to the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer training. This paper proposes modeling visual objects as the equivalent of words in language to improve semantic understanding in vision models. The authors introduce a semantic-grounded objective called masked image modeling (MIM), where masks are applied to visual objects for testing. Results show that object-level representation helps in learning real-world distributions and improves reasoning abilities in tasks like visual question answering. By incorporating object-level encoding, vision models can achieve stronger performance in understanding visual information. This study emphasizes the effectiveness of object-level encoding in vision models and provides a promising direction for future research in developing more robust vision encoders and tokenizers.

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning. However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers. Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces AgeBooth, a novel approach for enhancing age control in identity personalization models without requiring extensive age-varied datasets. By leveraging the linear nature of aging, AgeBooth employs age-conditioned prompt blending and age-specific LoRA fusion techniques, utilizing SVDMix for matrix fusion. These methods enable the generation of realistic and identity-consistent face images at different ages from a single reference photo. The results demonstrate AgeBooth's superior age control and visual quality compared to existing editing-based methods. This innovative approach addresses the challenge of accurately controlling age while preserving identity in diffusion model research, offering a more cost-effective and efficient solution for generating age-specific portraits. <div>
arXiv:2510.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based methods.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot semantic segmentation.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition, we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and framework for furthering universal AI image detection.

Summary:
ALISE is a new framework for outdoor LiDAR point cloud instance segmentation that operates without any human annotations. It leverages Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to generate initial pseudo-labels guided by text and images. These labels are then refined using a spatio-temporal voting module that combines 2D and 3D semantics for offline and online optimization. To enhance feature learning, ALISE introduces 2D prior-based losses and a prototype-based contrastive loss for semantic supervision, resulting in superior performance. The framework achieves a new state-of-the-art in unsupervised 3D instance segmentation, even surpassing supervised methods like MWSIS in mAP by 2.53%. ALISE's comprehensive approach showcases the potential for advanced unsupervised techniques in the field of 3D instance segmentation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth (GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Summary:
The paper introduces OneVision, an end-to-end generative framework that aims to improve traditional vision search by addressing the challenges of multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA). OneVision utilizes VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, to align different object representations across various viewpoints while maintaining distinctive features. A multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is then employed to combine strong visual similarity priors with user-specific information for personalized preference generation. Offline evaluations show that OneVision performs similarly to MCA but improves inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, OneVision demonstrates significant online improvements in item CTR (+2.15%), CVR (+2.27%), and order volume (+3.12%). These results highlight the effectiveness of a semantic ID-centric, generative architecture in unifying retrieval and personalization, simplifying the serving pathway, and enhancing user experience in vision search systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems, follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation. In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric, generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway.

Summary:
Deep learning in remote sensing image scene classification relies on large amounts of labeled data for effective generalization, but obtaining highly reliable labels can be costly and limited. This study proposes a method that combines weak sources of labeled data with a small reliable dataset to create multisource labeled datasets. A novel training strategy incorporating the reliability of each data source is introduced, using transition matrices to weigh each label during the training process. This weighting scheme at the gradient level ensures that each instance contributes differently to the optimization of classes. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method in leveraging unreliable sources of labels for training deep neural networks in remote sensing applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used during the training process to weigh each label according to the related source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Summary:  
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models effectively.  
- Most methods focus on final-layer representations, but intermediate layers in pre-trained models can provide rich signals for OOD detection.  
- Residual connections in models can subtly transform input projections to encode diverse information across layers.  
- An entropy-based criterion can automatically identify layers with complementary information for OOD detection without access to OOD data.  
- Selectively incorporating intermediate representations can significantly improve OOD detection accuracy by up to 10% in far-OOD and over 7% in near-OOD scenarios compared to existing methods. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the \textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode \textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers, we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting -- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising, which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image processing tasks.

<div> Keywords: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance, deep learning, keyframe detection, cine CMR, cardiac function<br />
Summary: <br />
A new method for detecting keyframes in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images has been proposed, using self-supervised deep learning. The method accurately identifies five keyframes in short-axis and four-chamber long-axis cine CMR, providing valuable insights into global cardiac contraction and relaxation patterns. By deriving dense deformable registration fields and computing a 1D motion descriptor, keyframes are determined based on characteristic curves, improving detection accuracy by up to 51% for short-axis and 47% for long-axis views in end-diastole and end-systole frames. The approach can detect additional keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with minimal cyclic frame difference, enabling temporally aligned inter- and intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics regardless of cycle or phase lengths. The method was evaluated using multiple datasets and showed promising results for detecting keyframes in CMR images. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration and research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole (ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis (SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&amp;Ms-2 (n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&amp;Ms (n=345) and ACDC (n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase lengths.

<div> Motion priors, optical flow, video understanding, multimodal large language models, redundancy <br />
Summary:
Flow4Agent is a framework designed to improve long-form video understanding, tackling issues of redundancy in spatial and temporal content. It integrates motion priors from optical flow to enhance the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in analyzing extended video sequences. Two key modules, Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) and Motion Token Pruning (MTP), work together to refine video representations at different levels. TGO optimizes temporal hierarchies based on flow and semantic priors to filter out irrelevant scene information. MTP utilizes fine-grained optical flow data to prune redundant video tokens within frames. Experimental results show superior performance of Flow4Agent compared to existing methods on various video MLLM benchmarks, especially excelling in hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving impressive accuracy rates on Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench datasets. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper, we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding. Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP) further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However, these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support routine application in biological research. In this work, we present acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten application workflows is open source and publicly available at https://github.com/JuBiotech/acia-workflows.

BioAutoML-NAS is a novel model that leverages multimodal data, including images and metadata, for accurate insect classification. The model utilizes neural architecture search to automatically learn the best operations within each cell of the network, extracting detailed image features. A multimodal fusion module combines image embeddings with metadata, enabling the incorporation of both visual and categorical biological information in the classification process. Through an alternating bi-level optimization training strategy and zero operations, BioAutoML-NAS achieves sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Evaluation on the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with 96.81% accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score. Validation on the Insects-1M dataset further confirms the model's effectiveness, with an accuracy of 93.25%, precision of 93.71%, recall of 92.74%, and an F1 score of 93.22%. These results highlight the potential of BioAutoML-NAS in advancing insect classification for agricultural management and ecological research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81% accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall, and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable farming.

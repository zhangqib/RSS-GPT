<div> Keywords: driver fatigue detection, vision-based techniques, YOLO11-CR, Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module, Rectangular Calibration Module

Summary:
Driver fatigue detection is crucial for preventing road accidents, with vision-based techniques offering a non-intrusive solution. However, challenges like poor object detection and limited feature modeling persist. To address this, YOLO11-CR, a lightweight object detection model, introduces the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) and Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM). CAFM enhances feature expressiveness by combining local CNN features with global Transformer-based context, while RCM improves spatial localization for profile faces and small objects like mobile phones. YOLO11-CR achieves high precision, recall, and mAP scores on the DSM dataset, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of CAFM and RCM in enhancing sensitivity and localization accuracy. The model shows promise for real-time fatigue detection in vehicles, with potential for future enhancements like temporal modeling and multi-modal data integration.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of 55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and embedded optimization.

<div> Benchmark, AI-generated images, detection, Mirage-R1, in-the-wild scenarios

Summary:
The article addresses the challenge of detecting AI-generated images (AIGI) in real-world scenarios, where existing detectors struggle to generalize. The authors introduce Mirage, a benchmark dataset that emulates the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI, sourced from both the internet and synthesized datasets. They propose Mirage-R1, a vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, trained through a two-stage process including supervised-fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Mirage-R1 also utilizes an adaptive thinking strategy at inference time for faster and more accurate detection. Experimental results show that Mirage-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art detectors on both Mirage and public benchmarks. The article emphasizes the importance of addressing the threat of AIGI in ensuring information security and public trust. The benchmark dataset and code will be made publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust. Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage. By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10% on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial. Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians' ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis, physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information. We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a 10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

<div> Keywords: large vision-language models, Optical Character Recognition, expert models, reasoning-enhanced framework, hallucinations

Summary: 
DianJin-OCR-R1 is a framework designed to improve document image parsing by combining large vision-language models with expert OCR models through a reasoning-enhanced approach. This model addresses the issue of hallucinations in LVLMs by leveraging the specialized capabilities of expert models for OCR tasks. By integrating the results of expert models as references, DianJin-OCR-R1 enhances the accuracy and reliability of OCR recognition. The reasoning process within the framework allows for a comprehensive analysis of the input image content, leading to more accurate recognition outcomes. Experimental evaluation on ReST and OmniDocBench datasets demonstrates the superior performance of DianJin-OCR-R1 compared to non-reasoning LVLMs and expert OCR models. This approach showcases the effectiveness of combining the strengths of large vision-language models with domain-specific expertise to achieve enhanced document image parsing capabilities. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However, generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images. Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction, our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: Urdu, optical character recognition, convolutional neural network, component-based classification, hierarchical neural network

Summary: 
Urdu, a cursive script language with complexities in its geometrical and morphological structure, poses challenges for traditional optical character recognition systems. This study proposes an approach using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for component-based classification in Urdu OCR. By training the CNN on a dataset generated through character permutation and employing a hierarchical neural network with two levels, the model achieved a high accuracy of 99% for component classification. The system addresses the context sensitivity of Urdu text through efficient segmentation techniques and automatic feature learning. By applying connected component techniques and discarding unnecessary images, the model focuses on ligatures, improving recognition accuracy. Overall, this innovative approach offers a promising solution for accurate and efficient Urdu optical character recognition. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of character permutations and component classification Our model successfully achieved 0.99% for component classification.

<div> Keywords: disease severity estimation, ulcerative colitis, endoscopic images, curriculum learning, ordinal classification

Summary: 
CLoE is a curriculum learning framework designed to estimate disease severity from endoscopic images, focusing on grading inflammation in ulcerative colitis using the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES). This framework considers label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the MES score. By implementing a curriculum based on image quality and incorporating ResizeMix augmentation, CLoE aims to improve performance in ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Experiments conducted on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets demonstrate consistent enhancements in performance compared to strong supervised and self-supervised baselines, with ConvNeXt-Tiny achieving 82.5% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC. This highlights the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies in improving disease severity estimation from endoscopic images, offering a promising approach for enhancing clinical assessments in ulcerative colitis. Code for CLoE will be available at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness. Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches 82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

Gait recognition is a biometric task that identifies individuals based on their walking patterns from a distance. GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based framework, generates realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain by training a video diffusion model exclusively on gait silhouette data. The generated sequences are temporally consistent, identity-preserving, and controllable. Synthetic samples from GaitCrafter improve gait recognition performance, especially in challenging conditions. The framework also allows the generation of novel identities by interpolating identity embeddings, maintaining the privacy of real subjects.

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain. Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch, exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects. Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

<div> Vision-Language Models, Autonomous Driving, Efficient Inference, Token Pruning, Multi-view Images <br>
<br>
Summary: 
Prune2Drive is introduced as a visual token pruning framework for efficient inference in multi-view Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework leverages diversity-aware token selection inspired by farthest point sampling to prioritize semantic and spatial coverage across views. Additionally, a view-adaptive pruning controller learns optimal ratios for pruning visual tokens from each camera view based on their importance for driving tasks. Prune2Drive does not require retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible with efficient attention implementations. Experimental results on DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1 benchmarks demonstrate significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining or improving task performance. With only 10% of the original visual tokens retained, Prune2Drive achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM benchmark. <br><br> <div>
arXiv:2508.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception, reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras. This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling, which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens, our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM benchmark.

<div> framework, adversarial examples, Lp-norm, perceptual alignment, meta-attack <br>
Summary: DAASH is a new framework for generating adversarial examples that are both effective and perceptually aligned. It strategically combines existing Lp-based attack methods in a multi-stage process, dynamically adjusting their contributions to minimize misclassification loss and perceptual distortion. DAASH outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks like AdvAD on models across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, achieving higher attack success rates and better visual quality. It also generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical baseline for evaluating robustness without the need for customized attacks for each defense. <div>
arXiv:2508.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion, enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates (e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM, LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively). Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Summary: 
The study introduces a computer-vision framework for assessing aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using facial photographs. The pipeline includes landmark detection, facial symmetry analysis, deep-learning age estimation, and nasal morphology assessment. The dataset collected consists of 7,160 pre- and post-operative images from 1,259 patients, with a subset focusing on rhinoplasty. Significant improvements were observed in nasal measurements and global facial symmetry. Patient identity was consistent post-surgery, with high True Match Rates. Inter-practitioner variability in improvement rates was also analyzed. The findings highlight the potential of this framework for data-driven surgical planning, patient counseling, and objective outcome evaluation in facial plastic surgery practices. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date, encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients, 96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001) occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3% exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age (p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

<div> Keywords: Easy-Options Bias, Visual Question Answering, VLMs, GroundAttack, NExT-QA

Summary: 
In this study, researchers identify an issue of Easy-Options Bias (EOB) in certain multiple-choice Visual Question Answering benchmarks. This bias allows models to select the correct answer without needing the question, making evaluations inaccurate. Through experiments, they found the bias stems from an imbalance in visual relevance, where the correct answer aligns more closely with visual contents than negative options. To address this bias, the researchers introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that generates hard negative options to create EOB-free annotations. Application of GroundAttack to specific datasets results in more realistic evaluations of VLMs, showing significantly decreased accuracy under certain settings. The release of codes and new annotations is planned to further contribute to improving VQA benchmarks.

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar, RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question (Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O) settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings, providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new annotations will be released soon.

The article introduces a novel framework called VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis) that utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and structured prompting to improve highway scene understanding and traffic risk inference. By combining large models like GPT-4o and o3-mini with a smaller student VLM through knowledge distillation, VISTA produces high-quality traffic scene annotations and risk assessments.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

- Enables individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional expression.
- Decomposes facial dynamics into distinct latent spaces for mouth, pose, eye, and expression.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge. The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50 baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50. In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Summary:
MINR is introduced to efficiently encode multiple images using shared intermediate layers and input-specific input and output layers. By analyzing weight distributions of trained INRs, it is found that intermediate layers exhibit similar patterns, leading to the sharing proposal. A unique projection layer is designed for each image to capture its distinct features. Experimental results show MINR can save up to 60% parameters while maintaining performance, even with 100 images. The approach scales effectively, achieving an average PSNR of 34 dB. Various backbone analyses demonstrate the robustness of MINR.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to 60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

DHQ is a distribution-aware Hadamard quantization scheme that targets both weights and activations in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). This approach standardizes diverse weight and activation distributions using the Hadamard transformation before applying a standard quantizer. Experimental results show that DHQ outperforms previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7%, energy consumption by 40.1%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3% compared to full-precision counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency. Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision counterparts.

Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a continuous manner through neural networks. However, their vulnerability to perturbations poses a challenge for real-world applications. This study explores the robustness of INRs and identifies that minor perturbations can significantly impact signal reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights, thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original INRs under noisy conditions.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new method for Micro-expressions recognition (MER) using multi-task learning and hierarchical attention. The approach combines 2D and 3D CNNs, AMNet2D and AMNet3D, with shared backbone network Resnet18 and attention modules.

arXiv:2508.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs) bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs' fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data. Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to existing mainstream approaches.

Summary:<br>
Multi-view clustering aims to find patterns in multi-view data by learning the consistency and complementarity between features. However, the role of cluster-oriented representation learning is often overlooked. This paper presents a novel framework called Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning (BDCL) to enhance inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness in multi-view clustering.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Summary:
AdaptiveAE is a new method for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging in dynamic environments. It uses reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to improve HDR reconstruction quality. By considering the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO, AdaptiveAE addresses issues such as motion blur and noise in dynamic scenes. It integrates an image synthesis pipeline that includes motion blur and noise simulation during training, utilizing semantic information and exposure histograms. The method can adaptively select optimal shutter speed and ISO sequences within a user-defined exposure time budget, outperforming traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that AdaptiveAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in HDR imaging. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach to analyze doubles badminton matches using pose-based shot recognition. By transferring singles-trained models to doubles analysis, the researchers extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet dataset using ViT-Pose and employed a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To enhance tracking stability, a custom multi-object tracking algorithm was implemented to address ID switching issues resulting from fast player movements. A Transformer-based classifier was then utilized to identify shot occurrences based on the learned embeddings. The findings showcase the feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, thereby expanding analytics capabilities in the sport. This work lays the groundwork for the development of doubles-specific datasets to advance understanding of this prevalent yet underexplored format of one of the fastest racket sports in the world.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles, previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format of the fast racket sport.

<div> tokenizer, AR image generation, visual information, geometric structures, Visual Gaussian Quantization 

Summary:
The article introduces Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a new framework for image tokenization in AR image generation. VGQ enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D Gaussians into traditional visual quantization frameworks, capturing geometric and spatial structures. This novel approach addresses limitations of existing tokenizers like VQ-GAN, which focus on texture and color, neglecting geometric details. By encoding image latents as 2D Gaussians, VGQ improves reconstruction fidelity and richness in visual content. Increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in reconstruction quality. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Increasing the density of 2D Gaussians further boosts reconstruction capability, surpassing existing methods with an rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93. Codes for VGQ will be released soon. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Summary:
Geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration addresses the gap between observed training samples and the true distribution in deep learning. Leveraging off-the-shelf foundation models for feature extraction demonstrates transferability of geometric shapes across domains. In the federated learning setting, a technique acquires global geometric shape under privacy constraints to bridge local and global observations. For long-tailed recognition, geometric knowledge from sample-rich categories aids in recovering true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Experimental results show improved performance in overcoming data heterogeneity and sample imbalance challenges with the proposed calibration framework. <div>

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc. In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf (vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment. This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Summary:<br><br>
The article introduces a novel framework called EAvatar for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction in AR/VR and multimedia content creation. The framework is based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and addresses the limitations of existing methods in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity in deformable regions. EAvatar incorporates a sparse expression control mechanism that accurately models local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions.

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR, gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism, where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems, limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Summary:
In this work, a lightweight Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) framework is proposed to address the challenges of large model parameters and high computational costs. The framework combines architectural redesign and operational refinement through dual-mode optimization. Architecturally, slimmer and more efficient layers replace traditional convolutions to reduce complexity while maintaining feature expressiveness. Operationally, a two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy is introduced, involving soft pruning during training and hard pruning post-training, ensuring training stability and inference efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves significant parameter reduction and computation savings compared to the baseline, while outperforming the state-of-the-art Versatile Video Coding standard in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. This approach is expected to facilitate the deployment of efficient GFVC in resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC framework that introduces dual-mode optimization - combining architectural redesign and operational refinement - to reduce complexity whilst preserving reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3 convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Summary: The article introduces a novel Neuron-like Encoding approach in the field of neuromorphic computing, specifically focusing on improving the performance of spiking neural networks (SNNs). The traditional limitation of SNNs in comparison to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is addressed through the development of a method that generates spike data based on biological neuron functions. By incorporating an artificial photoreceptor layer, the spike data can carry color and luminance information, creating a complete visual spike signal. Experimentation using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron model validates the effectiveness of this biologically inspired approach, enhancing the information content of spike signals and subsequently improving SNN performance. The proposed method aligns with the core principles of neuromorphic computing while offering promising potential for future advancements in the field, potentially overcoming current limitations and expanding the applications of SNNs.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data. Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader applications of SNNs.

It leverages self-supervised learning to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the few-shot anomaly segmentation task. The framework consists of three key components: the construction of a dictionary using features from normal reference images, the retrieval of queried region features via sparse lookup from the dictionary, and query discrimination regularization to enhance anomaly discrimination. This regularization includes Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint to make abnormal features harder to retrieve. Experimental results on seven public industrial and medical datasets show that DictAS outperforms current state-of-the-art FSAS methods consistently.<br><br>Summary: DictAS is a framework for few-shot anomaly segmentation that utilizes self-supervised learning to detect anomalies in unseen object categories without retraining.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation (FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes. However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically, DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** - to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space. Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify, generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify.

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving, which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation model that focuses on improving the segmentation head design for more accurate boundary segmentation. This model integrates existing segmentation methods and utilizes a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. By eliminating the noise prediction module to prevent degradation of segmentation accuracy, the model is simplified while performance is enhanced. A Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR) module is designed to address the limited feature extraction capability of the VAE, significantly boosting segmentation quality without complex designs.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore, our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation. The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain, snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based, and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62 percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in diverse SSM applications.

<div> Keywords: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, autonomous driving, robotic navigation, FoundationSSC, Axis-Aware Fusion.

Summary:
FoundationSSC introduces a novel approach to camera-based 3D semantic scene completion by dual decoupling at the source and pathway levels. By utilizing a foundation encoder to provide rich semantic features and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes, the model can better handle the conflicting demands of semantic and geometric priors. Decoupled pathways refine these priors, leading to improved semantic context and depth distributions for enhanced performance. A hybrid view transformation generates complementary 3D features using disentangled inputs. The Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module addresses the challenge of anisotropically merging features for unified representation. Extensive experiments show FoundationSSC's superiority, achieving notable advancements in both semantic and geometric metrics on benchmark datasets like SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. This new framework sets a state-of-the-art performance standard in 3D semantic scene completion. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However, existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised, decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions. Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by +0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61 IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results, thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for future use in the user acceptance test.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language, and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality, and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for future research.

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally, we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Summary:
Diffusion models have shown significant potential in generating high-quality samples and improving performance in various domains through Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the effectiveness of generated samples is highly dependent on the selection of the guidance weight. This study identifies a crucial "training-inference gap" that affects conditional generation performance and makes outputs sensitive to the guidance weight. By quantifying and reducing this gap using the proposed DiffIER method, which optimizes errors during inference through iterative error minimization, the quality of generated samples can be significantly improved. Empirical results across tasks such as text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation confirm the effectiveness and versatility of DiffIER in enhancing generation quality and advancing research in various applications.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap. Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks. Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects, e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e., portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage, the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects, with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at https://omnitry.github.io/.

<div> efficiency, topology fidelity, spatial consistency, graph generation, road network

Summary:
DeH4R is a novel hybrid model designed to address challenges in extracting road networks from remote sensing imagery. It combines efficiency and dynamics by decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph construction, and graph expansion. This allows for dynamic vertex and edge insertions while maintaining fast inference speed. The model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art method RNGDet++ on CityScale benchmarks by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU, while also being approximately 10 times faster. DeH4R achieves enhanced topology fidelity and spatial consistency, making it a promising solution for road network extraction in geospatial computer vision tasks. The code for DeH4R will be publicly available on GitHub to facilitate further research and application in this field.

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping. Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

<title>HumanPCR: Probing MLLM Capabilities in Diverse Human-Centric Scenes</title>

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C, and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000 human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9 dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise. Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over 30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric application of multimodal models.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently, advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g., yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20% labeled data.

<title>Hierarchical Vision-Language Retrieval of Educational Metaverse Content in Agriculture</title>

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\% MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/aliabdari/Agricultural_Metaverse_Retrieval .

<title>Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2508.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However, current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage, without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.

<title>Mitigating Cross-Image Information Leakage in LVLMs for Multi-Image Tasks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13744</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2508.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural modifications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2508.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/mr6d.

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to 2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template (SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together, these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

<title>VisionLaw: Inferring Interpretable Intrinsic Dynamics from Visual Observations via Bilevel Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13792</link>

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level, we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion. Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps, and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

<title>Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation</title>

arXiv:2508.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications. This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse (A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable attack success rate.

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain. Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities -- such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/grimalPaul/gsn-factory.

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of our system compared to the foundational model.

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

<title>In-hoc Concept Representations to Regularise Deep Learning in Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept supervision.

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of ~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM), the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress, current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image, enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets, annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments, significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image. By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex illumination conditions.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2) the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

<title>RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation</title>

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets, such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density, creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags, points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets, significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become increasingly crucial. Moreover, the widespread use of plastic wrapping has motivated researchers to investigate eco-friendly alternatives that still adhere to safety standards. We present a fully controllable and accurate physical simulation system capable of replicating the behavior of moving pallets. It features a 3D graphics-based virtual environment that supports a wide range of configurations, including variable package layouts, different wrapping materials, and diverse dynamic conditions. This innovative approach reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics. Additionally, we train a deep neural network to evaluate the rendered videos generated by our simulator, as a crash-test predictor for pallet configurations, further enhancing the system's utility in safety analysis.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100 km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks, which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of 30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods, reaching distances up to 250 meters.

Abstract: We introduce ResPlan, a large-scale dataset of 17,000 detailed, structurally rich, and realistic residential floor plans, created to advance spatial AI research. Each plan includes precise annotations of architectural elements (walls, doors, windows, balconies) and functional spaces (such as kitchens, bedrooms, and bathrooms). ResPlan addresses key limitations of existing datasets such as RPLAN (Wu et al., 2019) and MSD (van Engelenburg et al., 2024) by offering enhanced visual fidelity and greater structural diversity, reflecting realistic and non-idealized residential layouts. Designed as a versatile, general-purpose resource, ResPlan supports a wide range of applications including robotics, reinforcement learning, generative AI, virtual and augmented reality, simulations, and game development. Plans are provided in both geometric and graph-based formats, enabling direct integration into simulation engines and fast 3D conversion. A key contribution is an open-source pipeline for geometry cleaning, alignment, and annotation refinement. Additionally, ResPlan includes structured representations of room connectivity, supporting graph-based spatial reasoning tasks. Finally, we present comparative analyses with existing benchmarks and outline several open benchmark tasks enabled by ResPlan. Ultimately, ResPlan offers a significant advance in scale, realism, and usability, providing a robust foundation for developing and benchmarking next-generation spatial intelligence systems.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction. However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage. However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in 3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs, however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA), a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images. Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism, formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs, while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at https://github.com/jsrdcht/Noisy-Alignment.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models. We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches, from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining efficiency in training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians, resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS, noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles, achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense modification text that is around seven times more than its existing counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder, enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense modification texts.

<title>Image2Net: Datasets, Benchmark and Hybrid Framework to Convert Analog Circuit Diagrams into Netlists</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED) is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\% successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works. Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is 62.1\%-69.6\% lower than state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this problem.

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising 224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents' multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question, enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\% accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of native multimodal reasoning in current models.

Abstract: Colon polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This study investigates the application of deep learning-based object detection for early polyp identification using colonoscopy images. We utilize the Kvasir-SEG dataset, applying extensive data augmentation and splitting the data into training (80\%), validation (20\% of training), and testing (20\%) sets. Three variants of the YOLOv5 architecture (YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l) are evaluated. Experimental results show that YOLOv5l outperforms the other variants, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 85.1\%, with the highest average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.86. These findings demonstrate that YOLOv5l provides superior detection performance for colon polyp localization, offering a promising tool for enhancing colorectal cancer screening accuracy.

Abstract: Radiology, radiation oncology, and medical physics require decision-making that integrates medical images, textual reports, and quantitative data under high-stakes conditions. With the introduction of GPT-5, it is critical to assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks. We present a targeted zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano) against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated, multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice questions spanning treatment planning, dosimetry, imaging, and quality assurance. Across all datasets, GPT-5 achieved the highest accuracy, with substantial gains over GPT-4o up to +20.00% in challenging anatomical regions such as the chest-mediastinal, +13.60% in lung-focused questions, and +11.44% in brain-tissue interpretation. On the board-style physics questions, GPT-5 attained 90.7% accuracy (136/150), exceeding the estimated human passing threshold, while GPT-4o trailed at 78.0%. These results demonstrate that GPT-5 delivers consistent and often pronounced performance improvements over GPT-4o in both image-grounded reasoning and domain-specific numerical problem-solving, highlighting its potential to augment expert workflows in medical imaging and therapeutic physics.

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB, depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance. Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP (Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering, allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding. Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.

Abstract: Demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system may have multiple causes, the most common are infections, autoimmune responses, genetic or vascular etiology. Demyelination lesions are characterized by areas were the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers are broken or destroyed. Among autoimmune disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known Among these disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known and aggressive form. Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another type of demyelinating disease, typically with a better prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression by detecting lesions. While both adults and children can be affected, there is a significant lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric cases and demyelinating disorders beyond MS. This study introduces, for the first time, a publicly available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating disorders, including 3 with ADEM. In addition to lesion segmentation masks, the dataset includes extensive patient metadata, such as diagnosis, treatment, personal medical background, and laboratory results. To assess the quality of the dataset and demonstrate its relevance, we evaluate a state-of-the-art lesion segmentation model trained on an existing MS dataset. The results underscore the importance of diverse datasets

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2 based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs, sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated low-resource screening approach.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at: https://github.com/Shuxin-Liang/InnerGS.

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser. The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool to map brain microstructure and connectivity by analyzing water molecule diffusion in tissue. However, acquiring dMRI data requires to capture multiple 3D brain volumes in a short time, often leading to trade-offs in image quality. One challenging artifact is susceptibility-induced distortion, which introduces significant geometric and intensity deformations. Traditional correction methods, such as topup, rely on having access to blip-up and blip-down image pairs, limiting their applicability to retrospective data acquired with a single phase encoding direction. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to correct susceptibility distortions using only a single acquisition (either blip-up or blip-down), eliminating the need for paired acquisitions. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance comparable to topup, demonstrating its potential as an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility distortion correction in dMRI.

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes. The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak" optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline models.

Abstract: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for evaluating the prognosis of cancer patients. Present WSI-based prognosis studies generally follow a conventional paradigm -- cancer-specific model development -- where one cancer disease corresponds to one model and this model cannot make use of the prognostic knowledge from others. Despite its notable success in recent years, this paradigm has inherent limitations and has always been struggling with practical requirements: (i) scaling to the rare tumor diseases with very limited samples and (ii) benefiting from the generalizable prognostic knowledge in other cancers. To this end, this paper presents the first systematic study on Prognostic Knowledge Transfer in Pathology, called Path-PKT. It comprises three main parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 13 cancers and use it to evaluate the transferability of prognostic knowledge between different cancers computationally. (2) We design experiments to understand what factors affect knowledge transfer and what causes positive transfers. (3) Motivated by empirical findings, we propose a new baseline approach (MoE-PKT) with a routing mechanism to utilize the generalizable prognostic knowledge in other cancers. Finally, we show the transferability of source models to rare tumor diseases. This study could lay solid foundations for the study of knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis.

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes, achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity. Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter, we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning. While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore, leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.

Abstract: This systematic review critically evaluates publicly available abdominal CT datasets and their suitability for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in clinical settings. We examined 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets (50,256 studies). Across all 46 datasets, we found substantial redundancy (59.1\% case reuse) and a Western/geographic skew (75.3\% from North America and Europe). A bias assessment was performed on the 19 datasets with >=100 cases; within this subset, the most prevalent high-risk categories were domain shift (63\%) and selection bias (57\%), both of which may undermine model generalizability across diverse healthcare environments -- particularly in resource-limited settings. To address these challenges, we propose targeted strategies for dataset improvement, including multi-institutional collaboration, adoption of standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of diverse patient populations and imaging technologies. These efforts are crucial in supporting the development of more equitable and clinically robust AI models for abdominal imaging.

Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.

Abstract: High-throughput screening using automated microscopes is a key driver in biopharma drug discovery, enabling the parallel evaluation of thousands of drug candidates for diseases such as cancer. Traditional image analysis and deep learning approaches have been employed to analyze these complex, large-scale datasets, with cell segmentation serving as a critical step for extracting relevant structures. However, both strategies typically require extensive manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning. We present a novel method that applies a segmentation foundation model in a zero-shot setting (i.e., without fine-tuning), guided by an in-context learning strategy. Our approach employs a three-step process for nuclei, cell, and subcellular segmentation, introducing a self-prompting mechanism that encodes morphological and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed foreground/background points. We validate our method on both standard cell segmentation benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays, demonstrating that it accurately segments biologically relevant structures without the need for dataset-specific tuning.

Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain shift is critical for maintaining the reliability of neuronavigation during neurosurgery. While keypoint-based registration methods offer robustness to large deformations and topological changes, they typically rely on simple geometric interpolators that ignore tissue biomechanics to create dense displacement fields. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning framework that estimates dense, physically plausible brain deformations from sparse matched keypoints. We first generate a large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations. Then, a residual 3D U-Net is trained to refine standard interpolation estimates into biomechanically guided deformations. Experiments on a large set of simulated displacement fields demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms classical interpolators, reducing by half the mean square error while introducing negligible computational overhead at inference time.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of 22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings. Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4 MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our codebase at https://github.com/sebastibar/conditional-diffusion-breast-MRI.

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code: http://http://geometrylearning.com/Sketch3DVE/

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate geometric details.

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular disease, yet its utility is often limited by the sparse acquisition of 2D short-axis slices, resulting in incomplete volumetric information. Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges, including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{Ca}rdiac \textbf{L}atent \textbf{I}nterpolation \textbf{D}iffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods, eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence. Extensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate that CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By addressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework advances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for cardiovascular imaging.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience, highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW), vital for ensuring consistent blood flow to the brain, is closely linked to ischemic stroke. Accurate assessment of the CoW is important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler (TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature, affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD. In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO) network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of 0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame inference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce reliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with potential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained settings. Future research will explore bilateral modeling and larger-scale validation.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world, generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.

Abstract: Machine vision systems are susceptible to laser flare, where unwanted intense laser illumination blinds and distorts its perception of the environment through oversaturation or permanent damage to sensor pixels. We introduce NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing, integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions, and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in restored image quality.

Abstract: Purpose: Deep learning methods have shown promising results in the segmentation, and detection of diseases in medical images. However, most methods are trained and tested on data from a single source, modality, organ, or disease type, overlooking the combined potential of other available annotated data. Numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various modalities, organs, and diseases are publicly available. In this work, we aim to leverage the synergistic potential of these datasets to improve performance on unseen data. Approach: To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called MMIS-Net (MultiModal Medical Image Segmentation Network), which features Similarity Fusion blocks that utilize supervision and pixel-wise similarity knowledge selection for feature map fusion. Additionally, to address inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot label space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another. MMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities to build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH grand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for medical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved the best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for the fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1 for the fluid detection task. Conclusion: The quantitative results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed model due to the incorporation of Similarity Fusion blocks into the network's backbone for supervision and similarity knowledge selection, and the use of a one-hot label space to address label class inconsistencies and contradictions.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly, using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at https://github.com/JCruan519/MME-SCI.

Abstract: Patient-specific bone models are essential for designing surgical guides and preoperative planning, as they enable the visualization of intricate anatomical structures. However, traditional CT-based approaches for creating bone models are limited to preoperative use due to the low flexibility and high radiation exposure of CT and time-consuming manual delineation. Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD), a fast and accurate AI framework to reconstruct high-quality bone models from biplanar X-rays in 30 seconds, with an average error under 1.0 mm, eliminating the dependence on CT and manual work. Additionally, high tibial osteotomy simulation was performed by experts on reconstructed bone models, demonstrating that bone models reconstructed from biplanar X-rays have comparable clinical applicability to those annotated from CT. Overall, our approach accelerates the process, reduces radiation exposure, enables intraoperative guidance, and significantly improves the practicality of bone models, offering transformative applications in orthopedics.

Abstract: Due to high-mix-low-volume production, sheet-metal workshops today are challenged by small series and varying orders. As standard automation solutions tend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting production costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their full potential. The COOCK+ ROBUST project aims to transform cobots into mobile and reconfigurable production assistants by integrating existing technologies, including 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both the opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these technologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the process. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO research unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete implementation example throughout.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual learning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different domains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring large datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied CONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that enables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks, and modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes in isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework. Through careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically expand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives without catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved performance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually incorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\% improvement in Dice score compared to respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.

Abstract: The study identifies a clear evolution from traditional methods to more advanced machine learning approaches. Current algorithms face persistent challenges, including degraded image quality, damaged ridge structures, and background noise, which impact performance. To overcome these limitations, future research must focus on developing efficient algorithms with lower computational complexity while maintaining robust performance across varied conditions. Hybrid methods that combine the simplicity and efficiency of gradient-based techniques with the adaptability and robustness of machine learning are particularly promising for advancing fingerprint recognition systems. Fingerprint orientation estimation plays a crucial role in improving the reliability and accuracy of biometric systems. This study highlights the limitations of current approaches and underscores the importance of designing next-generation algorithms that can operate efficiently across diverse application domains. By addressing these challenges, future developments could enhance the scalability, reliability, and applicability of biometric systems, paving the way for broader use in security and identification technologies.

Abstract: Online multi-object tracking (MOT) plays a pivotal role in autonomous systems. The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states. Our proposed method utilizing LiDAR alone has shown exceptional performance compared to other online tracking approaches, including LiDAR-based and LiDAR-camera fusion-based methods. LEGO ranked 1st at the time of submitting results to KITTI object tracking evaluation ranking board and remains 2nd at the time of submitting this paper, among all online trackers in the KITTI MOT benchmark for cars1

Abstract: Generative models now produce images with such stunning realism that they can easily deceive the human eye. While this progress unlocks vast creative potential, it also presents significant risks, such as the spread of misinformation. Consequently, detecting generated images has become a critical research challenge. However, current detection methods are often plagued by low accuracy and poor generalization. In this paper, to address these limitations and enhance the detection of generated images, we propose a novel representation, Diffusion Noise Feature (DNF). Derived from the inverse process of diffusion models, DNF effectively amplifies the subtle, high-frequency artifacts that act as fingerprints of artificial generation. Our key insight is that real and generated images exhibit distinct DNF signatures, providing a robust basis for differentiation. By training a simple classifier such as ResNet-50 on DNF, our approach achieves remarkable accuracy, robustness, and generalization in detecting generated images, including those from unseen generators or with novel content. Extensive experiments across four training datasets and five test sets confirm that DNF establishes a new state-of-the-art in generated image detection.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel locally statistical active contour model (LACM) based on Aubert-Aujol (AA) denoising model and variational level set method, which can be used for SAR images segmentation with intensity inhomogeneity. Then we transform the proposed model into a global optimization model by using convex relaxation technique. Firstly, we apply the Split Bregman technique to transform the global optimization model into two alternating optimization processes of Shrink operator and Laplace operator, which is called SB_LACM model. Moreover, we propose two fast models to solve the global optimization model , which are more efficient than the SB_LACM model. The first model is: we add the proximal function to transform the global optimization model to a general ROF model[29], which can be solved by a fast denoising algorithm proposed by R.-Q.Jia, and H.Zhao; [29] is submitted on 29-Aug-2013, and our early edition ever submitted to TGRS on 12-Jun-2012, Venkatakrishnan et al. [30] proposed their 'pnp algorithm' on 29-May-2013, so Venkatakrishnan and we proposed the 'pnp algorithm' almost simultaneously. Thus we obtain a fast segmentation algorithm with global optimization solver that does not involve partial differential equations or difference equation, and only need simple difference computation. The second model is: we use a different splitting approach than one model to transform the global optimization model into a differentiable term and a general ROF model term, which can be solved by the same technique as the first model. Experiments using some challenging synthetic images and Envisat SAR images demonstrate the superiority of our proposed models with respect to the state-of-the-art models.

Experimental results for real SAR images show that the proposed image segmentation model can efficiently stop the contours at weak or blurred edges, and can automatically detect the exterior and interior boundaries of images with multiplicative gamma noise. The proposed fast fixed point algorithms are robustness to initialization contour, and can further reduce about 15% of the time needed for algorithm proposed by Goldstein-Osher.

Abstract: Deep learning enables automatic and robust extraction of cardiac function descriptors from echocardiographic sequences, such as ejection fraction or strain. These descriptors provide fine-grained information that physicians consider, in conjunction with more global variables from the clinical record, to assess patients' condition. Drawing on novel Transformer models applied to tabular data, we propose a method that considers all descriptors extracted from medical records and echocardiograms to learn the representation of a cardiovascular pathology with a difficult-to-characterize continuum, namely hypertension. Our method first projects each variable into its own representation space using modality-specific approaches. These standardized representations of multimodal data are then fed to a Transformer encoder, which learns to merge them into a comprehensive representation of the patient through the task of predicting a clinical rating. This stratification task is formulated as an ordinal classification to enforce a pathological continuum in the representation space. We observe the major trends along this continuum on a cohort of 239 hypertensive patients, providing unprecedented details in the description of hypertension's impact on various cardiac function descriptors. Our analysis shows that i) the XTab foundation model's architecture allows to reach outstanding performance (96.8% AUROC) even with limited data (less than 200 training samples), ii) stratification across the population is reproducible between trainings (within 5.7% mean absolute error), and iii) patterns emerge in descriptors, some of which align with established physiological knowledge about hypertension, while others could pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of this pathology.

<title>Rethinking Transformer-Based Blind-Spot Network for Self-Supervised Image Denoising</title>

Abstract: Blind-spot networks (BSN) have been prevalent neural architectures in self-supervised image denoising (SSID). However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.

<title>ContrastAlign: Toward Robust BEV Feature Alignment via Contrastive Learning for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: In the field of 3D object detection tasks, fusing heterogeneous features from LiDAR and camera sensors into a unified Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation is a widely adopted paradigm. However, existing methods often suffer from imprecise sensor calibration, leading to feature misalignment in LiDAR-camera BEV fusion. Moreover, such inaccuracies cause errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, aggravating misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a novel ContrastAlign approach that utilizes contrastive learning to enhance the alignment of heterogeneous modalities, thereby improving the robustness of the fusion process. Specifically, our approach comprises three key components: (1) the L-Instance module, which extracts LiDAR instance features within the LiDAR BEV features; (2) the C-Instance module, which predicts camera instance features through Region of Interest (RoI) pooling on the camera BEV features; (3) the InstanceFusion module, which employs contrastive learning to generate consistent instance features across heFterogeneous modalities. Subsequently, we use graph matching to calculate the similarity between the neighboring camera instance features and the similarity instance features to complete the alignment of instance features. Our method achieves SOTA performance, with an mAP of 71.5%, surpassing GraphBEV by 1.4% on the nuScenes val set. Importantly, our method excels BEVFusion under conditions with spatial & temporal misalignment noise, improving mAP by 1.4% and 11.1% on nuScenes dataset. Notably, on the Argoverse2 dataset, ContrastAlign outperforms GraphBEV by 1.0% in mAP, indicating that the farther the distance, the more severe the feature misalignment and the more effective.

Abstract: We introduce HouseCrafter, a novel approach that can lift a floorplan into a complete large 3D indoor scene (e.g., a house). Our key insight is to adapt a 2D diffusion model, which is trained on web-scale images, to generate consistent multi-view color (RGB) and depth (D) images across different locations of the scene. Specifically, the RGB-D images are generated autoregressively in a batch-wise manner along sampled locations based on the floorplan, where previously generated images are used as condition to the diffusion model to produce images at nearby locations. The global floorplan and attention design in the diffusion model ensures the consistency of the generated images, from which a 3D scene can be reconstructed. Through extensive evaluation on the 3D-Front dataset, we demonstrate that HouseCraft can generate high-quality house-scale 3D scenes. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of different design choices. We will release our code and model weights. Project page: https://neu-vi.github.io/houseCrafter/

Abstract: Reconstruction-based anomaly detection via denoising diffusion model has limitations in determining appropriate noise parameters that can degrade anomalies while preserving normal characteristics. Also, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during reconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the degree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems that impede practical application in display inspection.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential tool in modern computer vision, allowing practitioners to leverage backbones, pretrained on large datasets, to train successful models from limited annotated data. Choosing the right backbone is crucial, especially for small datasets, since final performance depends heavily on the quality of the initial feature representations. While prior work has conducted benchmarks across various datasets to identify universal top-performing backbones, we demonstrate that backbone effectiveness is highly dataset-dependent, especially in low-data scenarios where no single backbone consistently excels. To overcome this limitation, we introduce dataset-specific backbone selection as a new research direction and investigate its practical viability in low-data regimes. Since exhaustive evaluation is computationally impractical for large backbone pools, we formalize Vision Backbone Efficient Selection (VIBES) as the problem of searching for high-performing backbones under computational constraints. We define the solution space, propose several heuristics, and demonstrate VIBES feasibility for low-data image classification by performing experiments on four diverse datasets. Our results show that even simple search strategies can find well-suited backbones within a pool of over $1300$ pretrained models, outperforming generic benchmark recommendations within just ten minutes of search time on a single GPU (NVIDIA RTX A5000).

Abstract: Cooperative perception research is hindered by the limited availability of datasets that capture the complexity of real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) interactions, particularly under dynamic communication constraints. To address this gap, we introduce WHALES (Wireless enhanced Autonomous vehicles with Large number of Engaged agents), the first large-scale V2X dataset explicitly designed to benchmark communication-aware agent scheduling and scalable cooperative perception. WHALES introduces a new benchmark that enables state-of-the-art (SOTA) research in communication-aware cooperative perception, featuring an average of 8.4 cooperative agents per scene and 2.01 million annotated 3D objects across diverse traffic scenarios. It incorporates detailed communication metadata to emulate real-world communication bottlenecks, enabling rigorous evaluation of scheduling strategies. To further advance the field, we propose the Coverage-Aware Historical Scheduler (CAHS), a novel scheduling baseline that selects agents based on historical viewpoint coverage, improving perception performance over existing SOTA methods. WHALES bridges the gap between simulated and real-world V2X challenges, providing a robust framework for exploring perception-scheduling co-design, cross-data generalization, and scalability limits. The WHALES dataset and code are available at https://github.com/chensiweiTHU/WHALES.

Abstract: Event cameras hold significant promise for high-temporal-resolution (HTR) motion estimation. However, estimating event-based HTR optical flow faces two key challenges: the absence of HTR ground-truth data and the intrinsic sparsity of event data. Most existing approaches rely on the flow accumulation paradigms to indirectly supervise intermediate flows, often resulting in accumulation errors and optimization difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a residual-based paradigm for estimating HTR optical flow with event data. Our approach separates HTR flow estimation into two stages: global linear motion estimation and HTR residual flow refinement. The residual paradigm effectively mitigates the impacts of event sparsity on optimization and is compatible with any LTR algorithm. Next, to address the challenge posed by the absence of HTR ground truth, we incorporate novel learning strategies. Specifically, we initially employ a shared refiner to estimate the residual flows, enabling both LTR supervision and HTR inference. Subsequently, we introduce regional noise to simulate the residual patterns of intermediate flows, facilitating the adaptation from LTR supervision to HTR inference. Additionally, we show that the noise-based strategy supports in-domain self-supervised training. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both LTR and HTR metrics, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels. However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements. We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern. Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective. IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS. In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.

Abstract: Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB) data to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.

Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) methods have made remarkable progress, with most existing HMER approaches based on either a hybrid CNN/RNN-based with GRU architecture or Transformer architectures. Each of these has its strengths and weaknesses. Leveraging different model structures as viewers and effectively integrating their diverse capabilities presents an intriguing avenue for exploration. This involves addressing two key challenges: 1) How to fuse these two methods effectively, and 2) How to achieve higher performance under an appropriate level of complexity. This paper proposes an efficient CNN-Transformer multi-viewer, multi-task approach to enhance the model's recognition performance. Our MMHMER model achieves 63.96%, 62.51%, and 65.46% ExpRate on CROHME14, CROHME16, and CROHME19, outperforming Posformer with an absolute gain of 1.28%, 1.48%, and 0.58%. The main contribution of our approach is that we propose a new multi-view, multi-task framework that can effectively integrate the strengths of CNN and Transformer. By leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of CNN and the sequence modeling capabilities of Transformer, our model can better handle the complexity of handwritten mathematical expressions.

Abstract: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aggregates image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, termed \textit{slots}. It's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. Existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways yet fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a unified architecture, Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO). The key to our unification is simply shared quantizing VFM representations in OCL aggregation and decoding. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. We also mathematically analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and why their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Our source code and model checkpoints are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL.

Abstract: Even though a significant amount of work has been done to increase the safety of transportation networks, accidents still occur regularly. They must be understood as unavoidable and sporadic outcomes of traffic networks. No public dataset contains 3D annotations of real-world accidents recorded from roadside camera and LiDAR sensors. We present the TUM Traffic Accid3nD (TUMTraf-Accid3nD) dataset, a collection of real-world highway accidents in different weather and lighting conditions. It contains vehicle crashes at high-speed driving with 2,634,233 labeled 2D bounding boxes, instance masks, and 3D bounding boxes with track IDs. In total, the dataset contains 111,945 labeled image and point cloud frames recorded from four roadside cameras and LiDARs at 25 Hz. The dataset contains six object classes and is provided in the OpenLABEL format. We propose an accident detection model that combines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one. Experiments and ablation studies on our dataset show the robustness of our proposed method. The dataset, model, and code are available on our website: https://accident-dataset.github.io.

Abstract: Composed pose retrieval (CPR) enables users to search for human poses by specifying a reference pose and a transition description, but progress in this field is hindered by the scarcity and inconsistency of annotated pose transitions. Existing CPR datasets rely on costly human annotations or heuristic-based rule generation, both of which limit scalability and diversity. In this work, we introduce AutoComPose, the first framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to automatically generate rich and structured pose transition descriptions. Our method enhances annotation quality by structuring transitions into fine-grained body part movements and introducing mirrored/swapped variations, while a cyclic consistency constraint ensures logical coherence between forward and reverse transitions. To advance CPR research, we construct and release two dedicated benchmarks, AIST-CPR and PoseFixCPR, supplementing prior datasets with enhanced attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training retrieval models with AutoComPose yields superior performance over human-annotated and heuristic-based methods, significantly reducing annotation costs while improving retrieval quality. Our work pioneers the automatic annotation of pose transitions, establishing a scalable foundation for future CPR research.

Abstract: We introduce Geo4D, a method to repurpose video diffusion models for monocular 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. By leveraging the strong dynamic priors captured by large-scale pre-trained video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic data while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, disparity, and ray maps. We propose a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these modalities, as well as a sliding window approach at inference time, thus enabling robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses state-of-the-art video depth estimation methods.

Abstract: Creating relightable and animatable human avatars from monocular videos is a rising research topic with a range of applications, e.g. virtual reality, sports, and video games. Previous works utilize neural fields together with physically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle appearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods is the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To tackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural fields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to take advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To avoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We also propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation. Shadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel, which paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques combined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable or even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times faster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.

<title>EmoSEM: Segment and Explain Emotion Stimuli in Visual Art</title>

Abstract: This paper focuses on a key challenge in visual emotion understanding: given an art image, the model pinpoints pixel regions that trigger a specific human emotion, and generates linguistic explanations for it. Despite advances in general segmentation, pixel-level emotion understanding still faces a dual challenge: first, the subjectivity of emotion limits general segmentation models like SAM to adapt to emotion-oriented segmentation tasks; and second, the abstract nature of art expression makes it hard for captioning models to balance pixel-level semantics and emotion reasoning. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the Emotion stimuli Segmentation and Explanation Model (EmoSEM) model to endow the segmentation framework with emotion comprehension capability. First, to enable the model to perform segmentation under the guidance of emotional intent well, we introduce an emotional prompt with a learnable mask token as the conditional input for segmentation decoding. Then, we design an emotion projector to establish the association between emotion and visual features. Next, more importantly, to address emotion-visual stimuli alignment, we develop a lightweight prefix adapter, a module that fuses the learned emotional mask with the corresponding emotion into a unified representation compatible with the language model. Finally, we input the joint visual, mask, and emotional tokens into the language model and output the emotional explanations. It ensures that the generated interpretations remain semantically and emotionally coherent with the visual stimuli. Our method realizes end-to-end modeling from low-level pixel features to high-level emotion interpretation, delivering the first interpretable fine-grained framework for visual emotion analysis. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Action recognition in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses unique challenges due to significant view variations along the vertical spatial axis. Unlike traditional ground-based settings, UAVs capture actions at a wide range of altitudes, resulting in considerable appearance discrepancies. We introduce a multi-view formulation tailored to varying UAV altitudes and empirically observe a partial order among views, where recognition accuracy consistently decreases as altitude increases. This observation motivates a novel approach that explicitly models the hierarchical structure of UAV views to improve recognition performance across altitudes. To this end, we propose the Partial Order Guided Multi-View Network (POG-MVNet), designed to address drastic view variations by effectively leveraging view-dependent information across different altitude levels. The framework comprises three key components: a View Partition (VP) module, which uses the head-to-body ratio to group views by altitude; an Order-aware Feature Decoupling (OFD) module, which disentangles action-relevant and view-specific features under partial order guidance; and an Action Partial Order Guide (APOG), which uses the partial order to transfer informative knowledge from easier views to more challenging ones. We conduct experiments on Drone-Action, MOD20, and UAV, demonstrating that POG-MVNet significantly outperforms competing methods. For example, POG-MVNet achieves a 4.7% improvement on Drone-Action and a 3.5% improvement on UAV compared to state-of-the-art methods ASAT and FAR. Code will be released soon.

<title>ReservoirTTA: Prolonged Test-time Adaptation for Evolving and Recurring Domains</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces ReservoirTTA, a novel plug-in framework designed for prolonged test-time adaptation (TTA) in scenarios where the test domain continuously shifts over time, including cases where domains recur or evolve gradually. At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting, inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on the classification corruption benchmarks, including ImageNet-C and CIFAR-10/100-C, as well as the Cityscapes$\rightarrow$ACDC semantic segmentation task, covering recurring and continuously evolving domain shifts, demonstrate that ReservoirTTA significantly improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/LTS5/ReservoirTTA.

Abstract: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, "Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet)," which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique is introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results are reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.

<title>Enhancing Visual Reliance in Text Generation: A Bayesian Perspective on Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue of LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

<title>Boosting Adversarial Transferability for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using 3D Structure-invariant Transformation and Weighted Intermediate Feature Divergence</title>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification based on DNNs. Numerous adversarial attack methods have been designed in the domain of natural images. However, different from natural images, HSIs contains high-dimensional rich spectral information, which presents new challenges for generating adversarial examples. Based on the specific characteristics of HSIs, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability of the adversarial examples for HSI classification using 3D structure-invariant transformation and weighted intermediate feature divergence. While keeping the HSIs structure invariant, the proposed method divides the image into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various transformations are applied on each block to increase input diversity and mitigate the overfitting to substitute models. Moreover, a weighted intermediate feature divergence loss is also designed by leveraging the differences between the intermediate features of original and adversarial examples. It constrains the perturbation direction by enlarging the feature maps of the original examples, and assigns different weights to different feature channels to destroy the features that have a greater impact on HSI classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed method achieve more effective adversarial transferability on three public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack performance even under defense strategies.

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam (DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and communication. The dataset and code will open-source on https://github.com/dtc111111/mcnslam.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg, the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 21 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However, cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is available at https://github.com/NZWANG/FreqDGT.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving, with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road, 3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm, which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue. Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be obtained at https://github.com/shiyi-mu/S3AD-Code).

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning (OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors, termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities. OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally, mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our source code and model checkpoints are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/DIAS.

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data are available at https://github.com/528why/Dataset-Condensation-with-Color-Compensation.

Abstract: Reliable and real-time detection of road speed bumps and potholes is crucial for anticipatory perception in advanced suspension systems, enabling timely and adaptive damping control. Achieving high accuracy and efficiency on embedded platforms remains challenging due to limited computational resources and the small scale of distant targets. This paper presents SBP-YOLO, a lightweight and high-speed detection framework tailored for bump and pothole recognition. Based on YOLOv11n, the model integrates GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules into the backbone and neck to reduce computation while enhancing multi-scale semantic features. To improve small-object detection, a P2-level branch is introduced with a lightweight and efficient detection head LEDH mitigating the added computational overhead without compromising accuracy. A hybrid training strategy combining NWD loss, backbone-level knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-driven augmentation further enhances localization precision and robustness. Experiments show that SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0 percent mAP, outperforming the YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8 percent. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, it runs at 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, delivering a 12.4 percent speedup over the P2-enhanced YOLOv11. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for fast and low-latency road condition perception in embedded suspension control systems.

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task, especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running 1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video segmentation models.

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is available at https://github.com/jcwang0602/MLLMSeg.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific scenario and make comparisons.

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration. This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level, summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary manipulates the model behavior through overlaying images with special triggers. Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a few validation data and model parameters, which is impractical in many real-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service. In this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test time, in particular for local attacks and black-box models. The true label of every test image needs to be recovered on the fly from a suspicious model regardless of image benignity. We consider test-time image purification that incapacitates local triggers while keeping semantic contents intact. Due to diverse trigger patterns and sizes, the heuristic trigger search can be unscalable. We circumvent such barrier by leveraging the strong reconstruction power of generative models, and propose Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE). BDMAE detects possible local triggers using image structural similarity and label consistency between the test image and MAE restorations. The detection results are then refined by considering trigger topology. Finally, we fuse MAE restorations adaptively into a purified image for making prediction. Extensive experiments under different backdoor settings validate its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Solving it may unlock other problems, such as generalization, interpretability, or fairness. Although remarkably challenging to solve in theory, disentanglement is often achieved in practice through prior matching. Furthermore, recent works have shown that prior matching approaches can be enhanced by leveraging geometrical considerations, e.g., by learning representations that preserve geometric features of the data, such as distances or angles between points. However, matching the prior while preserving geometric features is challenging, as a mapping that fully preserves these features while aligning the data distribution with the prior does not exist in general. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach to disentangled representation learning based on quadratic optimal transport. We formulate the problem using Gromov-Monge maps that transport one distribution onto another with minimal distortion of predefined geometric features, preserving them as much as can be achieved. To compute such maps, we propose the Gromov-Monge-Gap (GMG), a regularizer quantifying whether a map moves a reference distribution with minimal geometry distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for disentanglement across four standard benchmarks, outperforming other methods leveraging geometric considerations.

Abstract: Automatic estimation of cardiac ultrasound image quality can be beneficial for guiding operators and ensuring the accuracy of clinical measurements. Previous work often fails to distinguish the view correctness of the echocardiogram from the image quality. Additionally, previous studies only provide a global image quality value, which limits their practical utility. In this work, we developed and compared three methods to estimate image quality: 1) classic pixel-based metrics like the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) on myocardial segments as region of interest and left ventricle lumen as background, obtained using a U-Net segmentation 2) local image coherence derived from a U-Net model that predicts coherence from B-Mode images 3) a deep convolutional network that predicts the quality of each region directly in an end-to-end fashion. We evaluate each method against manual regional image quality annotations by three experienced cardiologists. The results indicate poor performance of the gCNR metric, with Spearman correlation to the annotations of rho = 0.24. The end-to-end learning model obtains the best result, rho = 0.69, comparable to the inter-observer correlation, rho = 0.63. Finally, the coherence-based method, with rho = 0.58, outperformed the classical metrics and is more generic than the end-to-end approach. The image quality prediction tool is available as an open source Python library at https://github.com/GillesVanDeVyver/arqee.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their versatility in textual data, are increasingly being explored for their potential to enhance medical image segmentation, a crucial task for accurate diagnostic imaging. This study explores enhancing Vision Transformers (ViTs) for medical image segmentation by integrating pre-trained LLM transformer blocks. Our approach, which incorporates a frozen LLM transformer block into the encoder of a ViT-based model, leads to substantial improvements in segmentation performance across various medical imaging modalities. We propose a Hybrid Attention Mechanism that combines global and local feature learning with a Multi-Scale Fusion Block for aggregating features across different scales. The enhanced model shows significant performance gains, including an average Dice score increase from 0.74 to 0.79 and improvements in accuracy, precision, and the Jaccard Index. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based transformers in refining medical image segmentation, highlighting their potential to significantly boost model accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Model merging, particularly through weight averaging, has shown surprising effectiveness in saving computations and improving model performance without any additional training. However, the interpretability of why and how this technique works remains unclear. In this work, we reinterpret weight-averaged model merging through the lens of interpretability and provide empirical insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern its behavior. We approach the problem from three perspectives: (1) we analyze the learned weight structures and demonstrate that model weights encode structured representations that help explain the compatibility of weight averaging; (2) we compare averaging in weight space and feature space across diverse model architectures (CNNs and ViTs) and datasets, aiming to expose under which circumstances what combination paradigm will work more effectively; (3) we study the effect of parameter scaling on prediction stability, highlighting how weight averaging acts as a form of regularization that contributes to robustness. By framing these analyses in an interpretability context, our work contributes to a more transparent and systematic understanding of model merging for stakeholders interested in the safety and reliability of untrained model combination methods.

Abstract: Cancers identified in CT scans are usually accompanied by detailed radiology reports, but publicly available CT datasets often lack these essential reports. This absence limits their usefulness for developing accurate report generation AI. To address this gap, we present AbdomenAtlas 3.0, the first public, high-quality abdominal CT dataset with detailed, expert-reviewed radiology reports. All reports are paired with per-voxel masks and they describe liver, kidney and pancreatic tumors. AbdomenAtlas 3.0 has 9,262 triplets of CT, mask and report--3,955 with tumors. These CT scans come from 17 public datasets. Besides creating the reports for these datasets, we expanded their number of tumor masks by 4.2x, identifying 3,011 new tumor cases. Notably, the reports in AbdomenAtlas 3.0 are more standardized, and generated faster than traditional human-made reports. They provide details like tumor size, location, attenuation and surgical resectability. These reports were created by 12 board-certified radiologists using our proposed RadGPT, a novel framework that converted radiologist-revised tumor segmentation masks into structured and narrative reports. Besides being a dataset creation tool, RadGPT can also become a fully-automatic, segmentation-assisted report generation method. We benchmarked this method and 5 state-of-the-art report generation vision-language models. Our results show that segmentation strongly improves tumor detection in AI-made reports.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cost-efficient active learning (AL) framework for classification, featuring a novel query design called candidate set query. Unlike traditional AL queries requiring the oracle to examine all possible classes, our method narrows down the set of candidate classes likely to include the ground-truth class, significantly reducing the search space and labeling cost. Moreover, we leverage conformal prediction to dynamically generate small yet reliable candidate sets, adapting to model enhancement over successive AL rounds. To this end, we introduce an acquisition function designed to prioritize data points that offer high information gain at lower cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet64x64 demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework. Notably, it reduces labeling cost by 48% on ImageNet64x64.

Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.

Abstract: Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remain key challenges in medical image analysis. This is primarily due to the lack of high-quality, balanced, and diverse datasets. In this work, we present a newly developed MRI dataset named BRISC designed specifically for brain tumor segmentation and classification tasks. The dataset comprises 6,000 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans annotated by certified radiologists and physicians. It includes three major tumor types, namely glioma, meningioma, and pituitary, as well as non-tumorous cases. Each sample includes high-resolution labels and is categorized across axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging planes to facilitate robust model development and cross-view generalization. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we propose a transformer-based segmentation model and benchmark it against established baselines. In this work, we propose a transformer-based model designed for both segmentation and classification of brain tumors, leveraging multi-scale feature representations from a Swin Transformer backbone. The model is benchmarked against established baselines to demonstrate the utility of the dataset, enabling accurate segmentation and robust classification across four diagnostic categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and non-tumorous cases. In this work, our proposed transformer-based model demonstrates superior performance in both segmentation and classification tasks for brain tumor analysis. For the segmentation task, the method achieves the highest weighted mean Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 82.3\%, with improvements observed across all tumor categories. For the classification task, the model attains an accuracy of 99.63\%, effectively distinguishing between glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and non-tumorous cases. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/briscdataset/brisc2025/

Abstract: Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a neuroimaging technique known for its high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling non-invasive observation of brain activity through neurovascular coupling. Despite its potential in clinical applications such as neonatal monitoring and intraoperative guidance, the development of fUS faces challenges related to data scarcity and limitations in generating realistic fUS images. This paper explores the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework tailored for fUS image synthesis. The proposed method incorporates architectural enhancements, including feature enhancement modules and normalization techniques, aiming to improve the fidelity and physiological plausibility of generated images. The study evaluates the performance of the framework against existing generative models, demonstrating its capability to produce high-quality fUS images under various experimental conditions. Additionally, the synthesized images are assessed for their utility in downstream tasks, showing improvements in classification accuracy when used for data augmentation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at the region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances, a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding using Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

<div> Keywords: lesion segmentation, melanocytic tumors, dermoscopic images, dual-resolution architecture, automated skin cancer screening<br />
Summary: <br />
- The study focuses on improving lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images, specifically targeting melanocytic tumors, by developing a novel dual-resolution architecture inspired by ResNet.
- The proposed approach integrates a high-resolution stream for fine boundary details and a pooled stream for multi-scale contextual information, enhancing lesion recognition accuracy.
- Boundary-aware residual connections and a channel attention mechanism are utilized to inject edge information and adapt the model's sensitivity to color and texture variations in dermoscopic images.
- To address imaging artifacts and dataset limitations, a lightweight artifact suppression block and a multi-task training strategy combining various loss functions and a regularizer are introduced.
- Extensive evaluation on dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in improving boundary precision and segmentation metrics, surpassing traditional encoder-decoder baselines and offering potential for automated melanoma assessment systems. 

Summary:  <div>

Abstract: Lesion segmentation, in contrast to natural scene segmentation, requires handling subtle variations in texture and color, frequent imaging artifacts (such as hairs, rulers, and bubbles), and a critical need for precise boundary localization to aid in accurate diagnosis. The accurate delineation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a crucial component of automated skin cancer screening systems and clinical decision support. In this paper, we present a novel dual-resolution architecture inspired by ResNet, specifically tailored for the segmentation of melanocytic tumors. Our approach incorporates a high-resolution stream that preserves fine boundary details, alongside a complementary pooled stream that captures multi-scale contextual information for robust lesion recognition. These two streams are closely integrated through boundary-aware residual connections, which inject edge information into deep feature maps, and a channel attention mechanism that adapts the model's sensitivity to color and texture variations in dermoscopic images. To tackle common imaging artifacts and the challenges posed by small clinical datasets, we introduce a lightweight artifact suppression block and a multi-task training strategy. This strategy combines the Dice-Tversky loss with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer to enhance feature stability. This unified design enables the model to generate pixel-accurate segmentation masks without the need for extensive post-processing or complex pre-training. Extensive evaluation on public dermoscopic benchmarks reveals that our method significantly enhances boundary precision and clinically relevant segmentation metrics, outperforming traditional encoder-decoder baselines. This makes our approach a valuable component for building automated melanoma assessment systems.

Summary:
The article proposes a novel weakly supervised training framework for subcutaneous vessel segmentation in clinical images. It utilizes sparse annotations like centerline traces and dot markers, expanded into dense probabilistic supervision using a random walk label propagation model. This model incorporates vesselness cues and tubular continuity priors, generating per-pixel hitting probabilities and uncertainty estimates to prevent overfitting in ambiguous areas. The system learns vessel boundaries and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. A topology-aware regularizer encourages centerline connectivity and penalizes irrelevant branches. Experiments show the method outperforms traditional dense pseudo-labeling approaches, providing more accurate vascular maps and better-calibrated uncertainty for clinical decision-making. Annotation workload is reduced while maintaining clinically relevant vessel topology. <div>

Abstract: The task of parsing subcutaneous vessels in clinical images is often hindered by the high cost and limited availability of ground truth data, as well as the challenge of low contrast and noisy vessel appearances across different patients and imaging modalities. In this work, we propose a novel weakly supervised training framework specifically designed for subcutaneous vessel segmentation. This method utilizes low-cost, sparse annotations such as centerline traces, dot markers, or short scribbles to guide the learning process. These sparse annotations are expanded into dense probabilistic supervision through a differentiable random walk label propagation model, which integrates vesselness cues and tubular continuity priors driven by image data. The label propagation process results in per-pixel hitting probabilities and uncertainty estimates, which are incorporated into an uncertainty-weighted loss function to prevent overfitting in ambiguous areas. Notably, the label propagation model is trained jointly with a CNN-based segmentation network, allowing the system to learn vessel boundaries and continuity constraints without the need for explicit edge supervision. Additionally, we introduce a topology-aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity and penalizes irrelevant branches, further enhancing clinical applicability. Our experiments on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both naive sparse-label training and traditional dense pseudo-labeling methods, yielding more accurate vascular maps and better-calibrated uncertainty, which is crucial for clinical decision-making. This method significantly reduces the annotation workload while maintaining clinically relevant vessel topology.

Summary:<br />
- The paper introduces AugLift, a method to improve the generalization performance of lifting-based 3D Human Pose Estimation.
- AugLift enriches the input with keypoint confidence scores and depth estimates, improving generalization without extra data or sensors.
- It can be integrated into existing lifting architectures easily and boosts performance on unseen datasets by 10.1% and in-distribution performance by 4.0%.
- The method is robust across various architectures, leveraging sparse, keypoint-aligned cues to provide frame-level context for better generalization.
- The approach demonstrates the practical effectiveness of using off-the-shelf models for improving the generalization of pose estimation models. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.07112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly improves generalization performance without requiring additional data collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models (e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$, while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code will be made publicly available.

<div> Keywords: Vision-language alignment, Planner-Refiner framework, semantic gap, video-language tasks, MeViS-X benchmark

Summary:
The article introduces the Planner-Refiner framework, designed to address the challenges of vision-language alignment in video, such as evolving entities, action chains, and semantic gaps. The framework uses a Planner module to schedule language guidance and a Refiner module to iteratively refine visual elements' representations based on linguistic prompts. By processing noun-phrase and verb-phrase pairs, the Refiner directs visual tokens' attention across space and time in a single-step process. A recurrent system chains these steps and feeds the final representation into task-specific heads for alignment generation. The effectiveness of Planner-Refiner is demonstrated on two video-language alignment tasks, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially with complex prompts. A new benchmark, MeViS-X, is introduced to assess models' ability with long queries. Overall, Planner-Refiner shows promise for improving vision-language alignment in video tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language, evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains. The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair, to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps, maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks: Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential, especially for complex prompts.

Summary:<br />
In the paper, the authors introduce ForensicsSAM, an approach that enhances the fine-tuning of large vision models for image forgery detection tasks by addressing vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Three key ideas guide ForensicsSAM's design: injecting forgery experts into transformer blocks to improve forgery artifact detection, incorporating a lightweight adversary detector to identify adversarial images, and integrating adversary experts to counter feature shifts caused by adversarial noise. Extensive experiments show that ForensicsSAM outperforms existing methods in resisting adversarial attacks while maintaining high performance in image forgery detection and localization tasks. The approach is made available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model, without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

<div> Keywords: Active defense, deepfake technology, Two-Stage Defense Framework, adversarial perturbations, data poisoning<br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the challenge of short-lived effectiveness of active defense strategies against deepfake technology due to attackers retraining their models on protected images. To address this issue, the authors propose a Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF) that uses dual-function adversarial perturbations. These perturbations serve two purposes - distorting forged content directly and acting as a poisoning vehicle to disrupt the data preparation process for attackers' model retraining. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defense, ensuring long-term effectiveness. Experimental results show that traditional defense methods degrade when faced with adversarial retraining, while TSDF demonstrates strong dual defense capabilities, improving the persistence of active defense. The code for TSDF will be available on GitHub for further research and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence, as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models. This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt, which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF). Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles. First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a 12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE.

Summary:
This paper presents a method to address the challenge of precise needle alignment in robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. The proposed approach leverages periodic needle vibration to enhance needle detection robustness, even when visibility is low. A vibration-based energy metric is used to guide the repositioning of the ultrasound probe to correct misalignments in translation and rotation between the imaging plane and the needle insertion plane. Experiments conducted on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic system demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, achieving a translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and a rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees. This technique shows promise in improving the accuracy and reliability of needle alignment in challenging ultrasound imaging scenarios, offering potential benefits for more precise and successful percutaneous needle insertions in clinical settings.

Abstract: Precise needle alignment is essential for percutaneous needle insertion in robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. However, inherent challenges such as speckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust needle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In this paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound imaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many existing approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound images, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the needle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based energy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of plane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the ultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the needle insertion plane in both translation and rotation. Experiments conducted on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic ultrasound-guided needle insertion system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show the translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and the rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees.

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of 78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.

Summary:
Procedural data representation models are trained solely on procedural data and used with visual memory for various tasks without additional training. The approach achieves full compartmentalization with real-world images and performs comparably to models trained on real data. In comparisons, the procedural model comes within $1\% in NIGHTS visual similarity, outperforms by $8\% and $15\% in fine-grained classification tasks, and stays within $10\% on ImageNet-1K classification. Additionally, the model shows strong zero-shot segmentation, achieving a close performance level on COCO compared to models trained on real data. Analysis reveals differences in representations of object parts in procedural models, leading to incorrect memory searches and explaining any remaining performance gaps. <div>

Abstract: We train representation models with procedural data only, and apply them on visual similarity, classification, and semantic segmentation tasks without further training by using visual memory -- an explicit database of reference image embeddings. Unlike prior work on visual memory, our approach achieves full compartmentalization with respect to all real-world images while retaining strong performance. Compared to a model trained on Places, our procedural model performs within $1\%$ on NIGHTS visual similarity, outperforms by $8\%$ and $15\%$ on CUB200 and Flowers102 fine-grained classification, and is within $10\%$ on ImageNet-1K classification. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot segmentation, achieving an $R^2$ on COCO within $10\%$ of the models trained on real data. Finally, we analyze procedural versus real data models, showing that parts of the same object have dissimilar representations in procedural models, resulting in incorrect searches in memory and explaining the remaining performance gap.

arXiv:2508.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown great promise in medical image analysis by improving generalization across diverse downstream tasks. In ophthalmology, several FMs have recently emerged, but there is still no clear answer to fundamental questions: Which FM performs the best? Are they equally good across different tasks? What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic FMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive evaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different ophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection (glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and systemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal imaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM, RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension. Despite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension in external cohort remains challenging. These findings provide an evidence-based evaluation of ophthalmic FMs, highlight the benefits of model fusion, and point to strategies for enhancing their clinical applicability.

Abstract: Dentocraniofacial hard tissue defects profoundly affect patients' physiological functions, facial aesthetics, and psychological well-being, posing significant challenges for precise reconstruction. Current deep learning models are limited to single-tissue scenarios and modality-specific imaging inputs, resulting in poor generalizability and trade-offs between anatomical fidelity, computational efficiency, and cross-tissue adaptability. Here we introduce UniDCF, a unified framework capable of reconstructing multiple dentocraniofacial hard tissues through multimodal fusion encoding of point clouds and multi-view images. By leveraging the complementary strengths of each modality and incorporating a score-based denoising module to refine surface smoothness, UniDCF overcomes the limitations of prior single-modality approaches. We curated the largest multimodal dataset, comprising intraoral scans, CBCT, and CT from 6,609 patients, resulting in 54,555 annotated instances. Evaluations demonstrate that UniDCF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric precision, structural completeness, and spatial accuracy. Clinical simulations indicate UniDCF reduces reconstruction design time by 99% and achieves clinician-rated acceptability exceeding 94%. Overall, UniDCF enables rapid, automated, and high-fidelity reconstruction, supporting personalized and precise restorative treatments, streamlining clinical workflows, and enhancing patient outcomes.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native, variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional "thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its scale for complex chart analysis.

Summary:  
VideoAVE is a new publicly available dataset for video-to-text e-commerce Attribute Value Extraction (AVE). It covers 14 domains and 172 unique attributes. A post-hoc filtering system called CLIP-MoE ensures data quality, resulting in a dataset of 224k training and 25k evaluation data. The dataset is evaluated using state-of-the-art Video Vision Language Models (VLMs) for attribute-conditioned value prediction and open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. The results highlight the challenges of video-to-text AVE, especially in open settings, indicating the need for more advanced VLMs capable of incorporating temporal information. The dataset and benchmark code for VideoAVE are publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is important for structuring product information in e-commerce. However, existing AVE datasets are primarily limited to text-to-text or image-to-text settings, lacking support for product videos, diverse attribute coverage, and public availability. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoAVE, the first publicly available video-to-text e-commerce AVE dataset across 14 different domains and covering 172 unique attributes. To ensure data quality, we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts filtering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs, resulting in a refined dataset of 224k training data and 25k evaluation data. In order to evaluate the usability of the dataset, we further establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating several state-of-the-art video vision language models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Our results analysis reveals that video-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings, and there is still room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging effective temporal information.

Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89 percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with interpretable, hand-engineered features.

Summary: 
This article discusses the challenges of detecting hateful memes in the modern web, highlighting the need for improved methods using Vision-Language Models. The authors propose a dual-pronged approach, first introducing a prompt optimization framework that explores various prompt structures and supervision levels to enhance hate detection performance. They find that structured prompts and the InternVL2 model yield the best results. Additionally, a multimodal data augmentation pipeline is introduced to generate counterfactually neutral memes, enhancing classifier generalization and reducing spurious correlations. The study emphasizes the importance of prompt design and data composition in hate detection, showing that targeted augmentation can support more reliable and context-sensitive results. Overall, the findings suggest that prompt structure and data composition play crucial roles in hate detection, alongside model size considerations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity, and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup, successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive hate detection.

Summary: <br />
Recent advances in computer vision have heavily relied on data-driven approaches using deep learning and large datasets. While deep neural networks have excelled in tasks like stereo matching and monocular depth reconstruction, they lack explicit 3D geometric models for analysis and transferability. This study explores the significance of Gaussian curvature in 3D surface modeling, noting its invariance under coordinate changes. The study shows that Gaussian curvature offers a concise description of 3D surfaces and could potentially enhance 3D surface reconstruction by providing a geometric prior. Surprisingly, existing monocular and stereo methods seemingly utilize Gaussian curvature implicitly, yet lack an explicit module for extraction. Additionally, Gaussian curvature may serve as an unsupervised metric for evaluating stereo methods. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have predominantly relied on data-driven approaches that leverage deep learning and large-scale datasets. Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as stereo matching and monocular depth reconstruction. However, these methods lack explicit models of 3D geometry that can be directly analyzed, transferred across modalities, or systematically modified for controlled experimentation. We investigate the role of Gaussian curvature in 3D surface modeling. Besides Gaussian curvature being an invariant quantity under change of observers or coordinate systems, we demonstrate using the Middlebury stereo dataset that it offers: (i) a sparse and compact description of 3D surfaces, (ii) state-of-the-art monocular and stereo methods seem to implicitly consider it, but no explicit module of such use can be extracted, (iii) a form of geometric prior that can inform and improve 3D surface reconstruction, and (iv) a possible use as an unsupervised metric for stereo methods.

This study evaluates multiple image-to-graph transformation approaches for graph-level anomaly detection. Various segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets are analyzed, including color, texture, and shape descriptors. Results show that color descriptors provide strong standalone performance, while combining shape and texture features improves detection effectiveness. The best unsupervised configuration achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of 0.805 without pretrained backbones. Performance increases with sparse labels to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for graph-based machine learning tasks. Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces ComplicitSplat, the first attack that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage. This attack embeds adversarial content in scene objects that are only visible from certain viewpoints without needing access to model architecture or weights. The attack has been shown to successfully target popular single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based object detectors both in real-world and synthetic scenes. This marks the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, posing a new safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and robotic systems. ComplicitSplat demonstrates the potential for adversaries to tamper with images to cause harm, highlighting the importance of robustness and security in safety-critical tasks involving novel-view synthesis. <div>

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic systems.

Summary:<br />
- Foundation models in medical imaging, like ProFound, show high downstream performance with limited labeled data in prostate MRI tasks.
- Image quality in finetuning affects model generalizability, with distribution disparities impacting model performance.
- Varying high- to low-quality image ratios between finetuning and testing sets results in performance differences.
- Having sufficient high-quality images in the finetuning set is crucial for maintaining strong model performance.
- Finetuning data quality alignment is essential for pretrained models to outperform scratch-trained models, emphasizing the need for quality standards. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.11864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models in medical imaging have shown promising label efficiency, achieving high downstream performance with only a fraction of annotated data. Here, we evaluate this in prostate multiparametric MRI using ProFound, a domain-specific vision foundation model pretrained on large-scale prostate MRI datasets. We investigate how variable image quality affects label-efficient finetuning by measuring the generalisability of finetuned models. Experiments systematically vary high-/low-quality image ratios in finetuning and evaluation sets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its finetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In particular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between finetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream performance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the finetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the importance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between different downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate cancer detection.When quality ratios are consistent, finetuning needs far less labeled data than training from scratch, but label efficiency depends on image quality distribution. Without enough high-quality finetuning data, pretrained models may fail to outperform those trained without pretraining. This highlights the importance of assessing and aligning quality distributions between finetuning and deployment, and the need for quality standards in finetuning data for specific downstream tasks. Using ProFound, we show the value of quantifying image quality in both finetuning and deployment to fully realise the data and compute efficiency benefits of foundation models.

By integrating diverse adapters and leveraging tensor-level low-rankness, AdaRing reduces redundancy and increases representational capacity. Through rank-driven adapters collaborating to handle different tasks, AdaRing achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing training parameters by 90%. <div>

Abstract: Adapter-based fine-tuning has gained remarkable attention in adapting large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for a wide range of downstream tasks efficiently. In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned, without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices. Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.

<div> pruning, visual segmentation, large language models, token sampling, spatial information  
Summary:  
In this study, a novel visual token pruning method for Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS) tasks is introduced. The method, called EVTP-IV, utilizes spatial information to select a compact yet representative subset of tokens, improving coverage and accelerating inference in multimodal large language models. Empirical analysis shows a strong correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. The proposed method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks and 3.5X on image tasks while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20% of the tokens. Additionally, an information-theoretic analysis supports the design of EVTP-IV. Experimental results demonstrate that the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning baselines across varying pruning ratios. <div>

Abstract: Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS) tasks require segmenting objects in images or videos based on natural language instructions. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on IVS, their inference cost remains a major bottleneck, particularly in video. We empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20% of the tokens. Our method also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning baselines under varying pruning ratios.

<div> Keywords: Image super-resolution, lightweight models, convolutional neural networks, Transformers, Large Kernel Modulation Network<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces the Large Kernel Modulation Network (LKMN) as a pure CNN-based model for image super-resolution in resource-constrained scenarios. LKMN combines the Enhanced Partial Large Kernel Block (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN) components to balance performance and latency. The EPLKB enhances inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel attention, and uses large kernel strip convolutions for non-local feature extraction with reduced complexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between different features and fuses them using a cross-gate strategy to enhance complementarity. Extensive experiments show that LKMN outperforms existing lightweight SR models, achieving a 0.23 dB PSNR improvement over SOTA on the Manga109 dataset at 4x upscale, with significantly faster processing times. The code for LKMN is available on GitHub for reference and further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) in resource-constrained scenarios demands lightweight models balancing performance and latency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer low latency but lack non-local feature capture, while Transformers excel at non-local modeling yet suffer slow inference. To address this trade-off, we propose the Large Kernel Modulation Network (LKMN), a pure CNN-based model. LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel Block (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN). The EPLKB utilizes channel shuffle to boost inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel attention to focus on key information, and applies large kernel strip convolutions on partial channels for non-local feature extraction with reduced complexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local, and non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a cross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their complementarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight SR models while balancing quality and efficiency. Specifically, LKMN-L achieves 0.23 dB PSNR improvement over DAT-light on the Manga109 dataset at $\times$4 upscale, with nearly $\times$4.8 times faster. Codes are in the supplementary materials.

Summary: 
A study revisited the Sobel operator for handwritten character recognition (HCR) by questioning if first-order edge maps could drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron (MLP) effectively compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel derivatives as input, an MLP was trained on MNIST and EMNIST Letters datasets. Despite its simplicity, the MLP achieved 98% accuracy on MNIST digits and 92% on EMNIST letters, closely approaching the performance of CNNs. The study concluded that first-order gradients capture much of the class-discriminative information in handwritten character images, making edge-aware MLPs a viable option for HCR. These networks offer advantages such as a smaller memory footprint and transparent features.

Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron (MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option for HCR.

<div> Keywords: Video grounding, Online Video Grounding, Hybrid-modal Queries, Parametric Memory Block, Multi-modal queries

Summary:
The article introduces a new task called Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal Queries (OVG-HQ) that addresses challenges faced by traditional video grounding tasks. The OVG-HQ task allows for online segment localization using text, images, video segments, and combinations of these modalities. To tackle issues like limited context and modality imbalance, the OVG-HQ-Unify framework is proposed, incorporating a Parametric Memory Block (PMB) and cross-modal distillation strategy. A new dataset, QVHighlights-Unify, with multi-modal queries is constructed to support model training. The framework outperforms existing models and offers a robust solution for online, hybrid-modal video grounding. Evaluation metrics such as oR@n, IoU=m, and online mean Average Precision (omAP) are introduced to assess accuracy and efficiency in an online setting. The source code and datasets for this research are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Video grounding (VG) task focuses on locating specific moments in a video based on a query, usually in text form. However, traditional VG struggles with some scenarios like streaming video or queries using visual cues. To fill this gap, we present a new task named Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal Queries (OVG-HQ), which enables online segment localization using text, images, video segments, and their combinations. This task poses two new challenges: limited context in online settings and modality imbalance during training, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. To address these, we propose OVG-HQ-Unify, a unified framework featuring a Parametric Memory Block (PMB) that retain previously learned knowledge to enhance current decision and a cross-modal distillation strategy that guides the learning of non-dominant modalities. This design enables a single model to effectively handle hybrid-modal queries. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we construct QVHighlights-Unify, an expanded dataset with multi-modal queries. Besides, since offline metrics overlook prediction timeliness, we adapt them to the online setting, introducing oR@n, IoU=m, and online mean Average Precision (omAP) to evaluate both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments show that our OVG-HQ-Unify outperforms existing models, offering a robust solution for online, hybrid-modal video grounding.

<div> Localization-based Approach, SafeCtrl, Direct Preference Optimization, Safety Efficacy, Fidelity Preservation

Summary: SafeCtrl introduces a detect-then-suppress paradigm for text-to-image models to address the challenge of generating harmful content. It first precisely localizes unsafe content and suppresses harmful semantics instead of performing a hard substitution, allowing for a natural and coherent resolution into a safe alternative. The module is trained using Direct Preference Optimization, leveraging image-level preference data without costly pixel-level annotations. SafeCtrl significantly outperforms existing methods in both safety efficacy and fidelity preservation. This suppression-based control approach shows promise in building more responsible generative models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of text-to-image models is challenged by their potential to generate harmful content. While existing safety methods, such as prompt rewriting or model fine-tuning, provide valuable interventions, they often introduce a trade-off between safety and fidelity. Recent localization-based approaches have shown promise, yet their reliance on explicit ``concept replacement" can sometimes lead to semantic incongruity. To address these limitations, we explore a more flexible detect-then-suppress paradigm. We introduce SafeCtrl, a lightweight, non-intrusive plugin that first precisely localizes unsafe content. Instead of performing a hard A-to-B substitution, SafeCtrl then suppresses the harmful semantics, allowing the generative process to naturally and coherently resolve into a safe, context-aware alternative. A key aspect of our work is a novel training strategy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We leverage readily available, image-level preference data to train our module, enabling it to learn nuanced suppression behaviors and perform region-guided interventions at inference without requiring costly, pixel-level annotations. Extensive experiments show that SafeCtrl significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both safety efficacy and fidelity preservation. Our findings suggest that decoupled, suppression-based control is a highly effective and scalable direction for building more responsible generative models.

Abstract: Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost, and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available. In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos, we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale remote sensing applications.

Summary:
In this study, the use of synthetic MRI data generated by a pre-trained GAN model was explored to improve brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. Experiments with hybrid datasets combining real and synthetic samples showed potential benefits in whole tumor boundary delineation, particularly with a mix of 40% real and 60% synthetic data. However, challenges with class imbalance persisted, leading to lower accuracy in specific tumor regions like the tumor core and enhancing tumor. While overall quantitative performance was similar between models trained on real-only and hybrid datasets, qualitative assessments highlighted the advantages of incorporating synthetic data. The findings suggest that synthetic data augmentation can be a helpful strategy in brain tumor segmentation but underline the importance of addressing class imbalance and conducting larger-scale experiments with consistent volumetric data in future research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans is challenging due to tumor heterogeneity, scarcity of annotated data, and class imbalance in medical imaging datasets. Synthetic data generated by generative models has the potential to mitigate these issues by improving dataset diversity. This study investigates, as a proof of concept, the impact of incorporating synthetic MRI data, generated using a pre-trained GAN model, into training a U-Net segmentation network. Experiments were conducted using real data from the BraTS 2020 dataset, synthetic data generated with the medigan library, and hybrid datasets combining real and synthetic samples in varying proportions. While overall quantitative performance (Dice coefficient, IoU, precision, recall, accuracy) was comparable between real-only and hybrid-trained models, qualitative inspection suggested that hybrid datasets, particularly with 40% real and 60% synthetic data, improved whole tumor boundary delineation. However, region-wise accuracy for the tumor core and the enhancing tumor remained lower, indicating a persistent class imbalance. The findings support the feasibility of synthetic data as an augmentation strategy for brain tumor segmentation, while highlighting the need for larger-scale experiments, volumetric data consistency, and mitigating class imbalance in future work.

Summary: 
Point cloud denoising (PCD) is crucial for improving downstream task performance in real-world applications. This paper addresses the lack of a comprehensive survey on deep learning (DL)-based PCD models by identifying key challenges, summarizing existing methods, and proposing a taxonomy specific to denoising tasks. The PCD process is divided into outlier removal and surface noise restoration, covering various denoising requirements. By comparing methods based on similarities, differences, and advantages, the study offers insights on the advancements in PCD. Research limitations are discussed, along with future directions for further improvements in PCD.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world environment-derived point clouds invariably exhibit noise across varying modalities and intensities. Hence, point cloud denoising (PCD) is essential as a preprocessing step to improve downstream task performance. Deep learning (DL)-based PCD models, known for their strong representation capabilities and flexible architectures, have surpassed traditional methods in denoising performance. To our best knowledge, despite recent advances in performance, no comprehensive survey systematically summarizes the developments of DL-based PCD. To fill the gap, this paper seeks to identify key challenges in DL-based PCD, summarizes the main contributions of existing methods, and proposes a taxonomy tailored to denoising tasks. To achieve this goal, we formulate PCD as a two-step process: outlier removal and surface noise restoration, encompassing most scenarios and requirements of PCD. Additionally, we compare methods in terms of similarities, differences, and respective advantages. Finally, we discuss research limitations and future directions, offering insights for further advancements in PCD.

Summary: <br />
DynamicPose is a novel framework for 6D pose tracking that addresses challenges in fast-moving camera and object scenarios. It includes three components: visual-inertial odometry for compensating camera motion, depth-informed 2D tracker for correcting object translation deviations, and a VIO-guided Kalman filter for predicting object rotation. These components work synergistically to improve tracking accuracy. The framework forms a closed-loop system that guides subsequent 2D tracking and Kalman filter updates, ensuring precise pose initialization and accurate tracking. The method is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating real-time and robust 6D pose tracking capabilities for scenarios involving fast-moving cameras and objects. <div>
arXiv:2508.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DynamicPose, a retraining-free 6D pose tracking framework that improves tracking robustness in fast-moving camera and object scenarios. Previous work is mainly applicable to static or quasi-static scenes, and its performance significantly deteriorates when both the object and the camera move rapidly. To overcome these challenges, we propose three synergistic components: (1) A visual-inertial odometry compensates for the shift in the Region of Interest (ROI) caused by camera motion; (2) A depth-informed 2D tracker corrects ROI deviations caused by large object translation; (3) A VIO-guided Kalman filter predicts object rotation, generates multiple candidate poses, and then obtains the final pose by hierarchical refinement. The 6D pose tracking results guide subsequent 2D tracking and Kalman filter updates, forming a closed-loop system that ensures accurate pose initialization and precise pose tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving real-time and robust 6D pose tracking for fast-moving cameras and objects.

Summary:
This paper explores the use of multi-scale feature approximation and transferable features for object detection from point clouds. Traditional multi-scale feature learning methods can be computationally intensive and may not be suitable for resource-constrained environments. The proposed method approximates multi-scale features from a single neighborhood using knowledge distillation, reducing computational costs. To address the lack of diversity in a single neighborhood, a transferable feature embedding mechanism based on class-aware statistics is introduced. Additionally, a central weighted intersection over union approach is used for localization to improve accuracy.

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-scale feature approximation and transferable features for object detection from point clouds. Multi-scale features are critical for object detection from point clouds. However, multi-scale feature learning usually involves multiple neighborhood searches and scale-aware layers, which can hinder efforts to achieve lightweight models and may not be conducive to research constrained by limited computational resources. This paper approximates point-based multi-scale features from a single neighborhood based on knowledge distillation. To compensate for the loss of constructive diversity in a single neighborhood, this paper designs a transferable feature embedding mechanism. Specifically, class-aware statistics are employed as transferable features given the small computational cost. In addition, this paper introduces the central weighted intersection over union for localization to alleviate the misalignment brought by the center offset in optimization. Note that the method presented in this paper saves computational costs. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Despite the impressive progress on understanding and generating images shown by the recent unified architectures, the integration of 3D tasks remains challenging and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce UniUGG, the first unified understanding and generation framework for 3D modalities. Our unified framework employs an LLM to comprehend and decode sentences and 3D representations. At its core, we propose a spatial decoder leveraging a latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D representations. This allows for the generation and imagination of 3D scenes based on a reference image and an arbitrary view transformation, while remaining supports for spatial visual question answering (VQA) tasks. Additionally, we propose a geometric-semantic learning strategy to pretrain the vision encoder. This design jointly captures the input's semantic and geometric cues, enhancing both spatial understanding and generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in visual representation, spatial understanding, and 3D generation. The source code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Summary: 
SAMDWICH is a new moment-aware framework for Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) that leverages a newly annotated dataset, MeViS-M, to improve video-text alignment. The framework incorporates Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP) to enhance object grounding and tracking, and Object-level Selective Supervision (OSS) to reduce semantic noise during training. By aligning text-to-clip pairs based on temporal moments, SAMDWICH achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MeViS benchmark, especially in complex scenarios with diverse expressions. The moment-centric memory mechanism of MDP enables training on both relevant and irrelevant frames, leading to improved referential understanding. This selective supervision of objects aligned with the expression in training clips enhances language-conditioned learning and strengthens video-object segmentation results.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment and track objects in videos based on natural language expressions, requiring precise alignment between visual content and textual queries. However, existing methods often suffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling and supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their actual relevance to the expression. To address this, we introduce a moment-aware RVOS framework named SAMDWICH, along with a newly annotated dataset, MeViS-M, built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark. We manually annotate temporal moments indicating when each object is referred to by the expression, enabling semantically grounded supervision that strengthens video-text alignment. SAMDWICH leverages these aligned text-to-clip pairs to guide training, significantly enhancing referential understanding. Building upon this framework, we propose Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP), a moment-aware propagation strategy that improves both object grounding and tracking by training on both relevant and irrelevant frames through a moment-centric memory mechanism. In addition, we introduce Object-level Selective Supervision (OSS), an object-level filtering strategy that supervises only the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip. This selective supervision reduces semantic noise and reinforces language-conditioned learning. Extensive experiments show that SAMDWICH achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging MeViS benchmark, particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving diverse expressions.

Abstract: Edge detection serves as a critical foundation for numerous computer vision applications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image editing, by extracting essential structural cues that define object boundaries and salient edges. To be viable for broad deployment across devices with varying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy with low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their applicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving that balance: \textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture discriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated models}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to reduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection accuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived from heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple parameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble perspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also provide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements, highlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource constraints.

<div> Keywords: Micro-expression analysis, Event cameras, Action Unit classification, Spiking Neural Networks, Conditional Variational Autoencoders

Summary:
Event cameras offer a solution to the limitations of RGB cameras in capturing subtle and fast facial movements for micro-expression analysis. A novel dataset featuring synchronized RGB and event camera recordings under varying lighting conditions is introduced. The dataset is used to explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of micro-expressions through two baseline tasks: Action Unit classification and frame reconstruction. The study shows that using event-based data improves the accuracy of Action Unit classification compared to RGB data, highlighting the potential of event cameras in micro-expression recognition. Additionally, frame reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders with high-resolution event input achieves promising results, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing event-based data for this task. <div>

Abstract: Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM = 0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition and frame reconstruction.

<div> e-commerce, product understanding, Multimodal Large Language Models, MOON, MBE <br />
<br />Summary: <br /> 
The article introduces a generative Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) called MOON for product representation learning. The model addresses challenges such as the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical language models, background noise in product images, and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. MOON utilizes a guided Mixture-of-Experts module to target multimodal and aspect-specific product content, detects core semantic regions in product images to reduce interference from background noise, and introduces a specialized negative sampling strategy to enhance sample diversity. The researchers also released a large-scale multimodal benchmark (MBE) for product understanding tasks. Experimental results show competitive zero-shot performance on the benchmark and public dataset, indicating strong generalization abilities across various tasks like cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. The case study and visualization further underscore the effectiveness of MOON in product understanding. <div>
arXiv:2508.11999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

Summary:<br />
InstDrive is introduced as a framework for reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. The framework utilizes masks generated by SAM for guiding 2D feature learning and introduces regularization at the 3D level to encode instance identities and ensure consistency. A lightweight static codebook bridges continuous features and discrete identities without complex optimization. InstDrive is tailored for interactive reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes and achieves 3D instance segmentation in open-world driving scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of the framework, distinguishing it as the first to achieve this level of segmentation in dynamic driving scenes.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted increasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene understanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most methods still unify all background elements into a single representation, hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the 3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are available at our project page.

<div> Keywords: LV linear measurements, B-mode echocardiographic images, automated method, WiseLVAM, Anatomical Motion Mode (AMM)<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces WiseLVAM, a fully automated framework for LV linear measurements in echocardiographic images. It addresses the issue of measurement errors due to small shifts in predicted points along LV walls by proposing a contour-aware approach for SL placement. This approach involves estimating the LV contour using a weakly supervised landmark detector and inferring the LV long axis and basal level following clinical guidelines. WiseLVAM combines structure-awareness from B-mode images and motion-awareness from AMM mode to improve robustness and accuracy. By automating SL placement and LV measurements, WiseLVAM offers a practical solution for routine clinical applications, enhancing the reliability of LV assessments. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical guidelines recommend performing left ventricular (LV) linear measurements in B-mode echocardiographic images at the basal level -- typically at the mitral valve leaflet tips -- and aligned perpendicular to the LV long axis along a virtual scanline (SL). However, most automated methods estimate landmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even small shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant measurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent semi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining landmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated Anatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To enable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in this work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised B-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV long axis and the basal level-mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this foundation, we introduce \textit{WiseLVAM} -- a novel, fully automated yet manually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then automatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode. \textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the motion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the potential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a quantum-inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier models, especially on complex cases needing image-text reasoning. The mix of frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability. Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and helpful AI tools for doctors.

Summary:
VimoRAG is a new framework that enhances motion generation for large language models (LLMs) by utilizing video databases to retrieve relevant human motion signals. The framework addresses challenges faced by motion LLMs such as out-of-domain and out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated data.

Abstract: This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion generation framework for motion large language models (LLMs). As motion LLMs face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1) developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer, enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs constrained to text-only input.

<div> Keywords: computer vision, object detection, automated model evaluation, prediction consistency, reliability

Summary:
The article introduces an automated model evaluation framework, AutoEval, for object detection in computer vision. The framework utilizes Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR) to estimate detection performance without the need for manual annotation. PCR measures spatial consistency between candidate bounding boxes generated before and after non-maximum suppression and evaluates the reliability of retained boxes based on confidence scores. Additionally, a meta-dataset is created by applying image corruptions of varying severity for a more realistic evaluation. Experimental results show that PCR provides more accurate performance estimates compared to existing methods, and the meta-dataset expands the range of detection performance evaluation. The code for this framework is accessible on GitHub for implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR), which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods, and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/autoeval-det.

Summary:
DiffGEBD is a novel diffusion-based boundary detection model for identifying event boundaries in videos. It takes a generative approach, considering the diversity of plausible solutions. By encoding changes between frames and decoding noise into boundaries, it generates diverse and meaningful segments. The model features classifier-free guidance for controlling diversity in predictions. A new evaluation metric evaluates predictions based on both diversity and fidelity, resulting in strong performance on standard benchmarks Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS. DiffGEBD excels in generating diverse and plausible event boundaries by capturing temporal self-similarity and allowing for controlled diversity in predictions. <div>
arXiv:2508.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic event boundary detection (GEBD) aims to identify natural boundaries in a video, segmenting it into distinct and meaningful chunks. Despite the inherent subjectivity of event boundaries, previous methods have focused on deterministic predictions, overlooking the diversity of plausible solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based boundary detection model, dubbed DiffGEBD, that tackles the problem of GEBD from a generative perspective. The proposed model encodes relevant changes across adjacent frames via temporal self-similarity and then iteratively decodes random noise into plausible event boundaries being conditioned on the encoded features. Classifier-free guidance allows the degree of diversity to be controlled in denoising diffusion. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric to assess the quality of predictions considering both diversity and fidelity. Experiments show that our method achieves strong performance on two standard benchmarks, Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS, generating diverse and plausible event boundaries.

Summary:
The article proposes a method utilizing a multi-stage convolutional neural network to reduce uncertainty in 3D point accuracy of laser scanners in rough indoor environments, improving spatial measurements for precise geometric modeling. By pairing high-accuracy scanners as references with low-accuracy scanners in the same settings, specific error patterns are quantified.

This approach transforms systematic error quantification into a supervised learning problem, enhancing measurement accuracy while preserving critical geometric features. Experimental results on rough indoor rooms demonstrate significant improvements in measurement accuracy, with a reduction in mean square error exceeding 70% and a peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement of approximately 6 decibels. This method enables low-end laser scanners to achieve accuracy levels approaching high-end devices without hardware modifications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose a multi-stage convolutional neural network (MSCNN) based integrated method for reducing uncertainty of 3D point accuracy of lasar scanner (LS) in rough indoor rooms, providing more accurate spatial measurements for high-precision geometric model creation and renovation. Due to different equipment limitations and environmental factors, high-end and low-end LS have positional errors. Our approach pairs high-accuracy scanners (HAS) as references with corresponding low-accuracy scanners (LAS) of measurements in identical environments to quantify specific error patterns. By establishing a statistical relationship between measurement discrepancies and their spatial distribution, we develop a correction framework that combines traditional geometric processing with targeted neural network refinement. This method transforms the quantification of systematic errors into a supervised learning problem, allowing precise correction while preserving critical geometric features. Experimental results in our rough indoor rooms dataset show significant improvements in measurement accuracy, with mean square error (MSE) reductions exceeding 70% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements of approximately 6 decibels. This approach enables low-end devices to achieve measurement uncertainty levels approaching those of high-end devices without hardware modifications.

Summary: <br />
Diffusion models have revolutionized image synthesis but face challenges in deployment due to computationally intensive denoising processes. Post-training quantization (PTQ) helps accelerate sampling but accumulates quantization errors during generation. This study develops a theoretical framework to mathematically model error propagation in diffusion models, deriving equations for quantization error propagation and providing a closed-form solution for cumulative error. A timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme is proposed to mitigate error propagation, improving PTQ methods' performance on low-precision diffusion models. Extensive experiments across various image datasets show that the compensation strategy effectively enhances existing PTQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-precision diffusion models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization(PTQ) provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive experiments across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing existing PTQ methods to achieve state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance on low-precision diffusion models.

The article introduces VELVET-Med, a novel vision-language pre-training framework designed for limited volumetric medical data like 3D CT scans and radiology reports. The framework incorporates uni-modal self-supervised learning, introduces a new language encoder called TriBERT for multi-level textual semantics, and utilizes hierarchical contrastive learning to capture vision-language correspondence. Despite using only a small dataset of 38,875 scan-report pairs, the approach uncovers spatial and semantic relationships within medical images and narratives.

arXiv:2508.12108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-language models (VLMs) have been increasingly explored in the medical domain, particularly following the success of CLIP in general domain. However, unlike the relatively straightforward pairing of 2D images and text, curating large-scale paired data in the medical field for volumetric modalities such as CT scans remains a challenging and time-intensive process. This difficulty often limits the performance on downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel vision-language pre-training (VLP) framework, termed as \textbf{VELVET-Med}, specifically designed for limited volumetric data such as 3D CT and associated radiology reports. Instead of relying on large-scale data collection, our method focuses on the development of effective pre-training objectives and model architectures. The key contributions are: 1) We incorporate uni-modal self-supervised learning into VLP framework, which are often underexplored in the existing literature. 2) We propose a novel language encoder, termed as \textbf{TriBERT}, for learning multi-level textual semantics. 3) We devise the hierarchical contrastive learning to capture multi-level vision-language correspondence. Using only 38,875 scan-report pairs, our approach seeks to uncover rich spatial and semantic relationships embedded in volumetric medical images and corresponding clinical narratives, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the learned encoders. The resulting encoders exhibit strong transferability, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, including 3D segmentation, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance on vision-language tasks, but their long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities in multimodal scenarios remain underexplored. Inspired by OpenAI's o3 model, which emulates human-like ''thinking with image'' through iterative visual transformations and linguistic reasoning, we propose Simple o3, an end-to-end framework that integrates dynamic tool interactions (e.g., cropping, zooming, and reusing) into interleaved vision-language reasoning via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our approach features a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality interleaved vision-language reasoning chains via an ''observe-reason-act'' cycle, complete with executable visual operations and rigorous verification, yielding the open-source TWI-Tools-146K dataset. Experimental results demonstrate Simple o3's superior performance on diverse benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches. By combining enhanced reasoning capabilities, Simple o3 establishes a powerful yet computationally affordable paradigm for advancing multimodal reasoning. Remarkably, we provide the first in-depth analysis of different interleaved reasoning strategies, offering insights into their impact on model performance. We found that by introducing additional visual tokens for interleaved vision-language reasoning, reusing and magnifying the original image significantly improves the model's visual reasoning and fine-grained perception, while image cropping based on precise visual grounding allows the model to effectively focus on key entities or regions, further enhancing its capabilities.

<br />
Summary: 
DualFit is a new Virtual Try-On (VTON) technology that improves online fashion retail experiences by accurately visualizing how garments would look on users. By using a two-stage approach, DualFit first aligns the target garment with the person image using a learned flow field to preserve garment details such as logos and text elements crucial for brand integrity and customer trust. In the second stage, a fidelity-preserving try-on module blends the warped garment with preserved human regions, guided by a preserved-region input and an inpainting mask to retain key areas and regenerate only as needed around garment seams. The extensive qualitative results demonstrate that DualFit achieves visually seamless try-on outcomes while faithfully maintaining high-frequency garment details, striking an effective balance between reconstruction accuracy and perceptual realism.

arXiv:2508.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Try-On technology has garnered significant attention for its potential to transform the online fashion retail experience by allowing users to visualize how garments would look on them without physical trials. While recent advances in diffusion-based warping-free methods have improved perceptual quality, they often fail to preserve fine-grained garment details such as logos and printed text elements that are critical for brand integrity and customer trust. In this work, we propose DualFit, a hybrid VTON pipeline that addresses this limitation by two-stage approach. In the first stage, DualFit warps the target garment to align with the person image using a learned flow field, ensuring high-fidelity preservation. In the second stage, a fidelity-preserving try-on module synthesizes the final output by blending the warped garment with preserved human regions. Particularly, to guide this process, we introduce a preserved-region input and an inpainting mask, enabling the model to retain key areas and regenerate only where necessary, particularly around garment seams.

<div> Keywords: Quantized Neural Networks, Adversarial Attacks, Defense Mechanism, Transferability, Gradient Alignment

Summary:
TriQDef is a defense framework for Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) that aims to disrupt the transferability of patch-based adversarial attacks. It consists of three components: a Feature Disalignment Penalty (FDP) to enforce semantic inconsistency, a Gradient Perceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) to misalign input gradients across bit-widths, and a Joint Quantization-Aware Training Protocol to unify these penalties. TriQDef significantly reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) on unseen patch and quantization combinations by over 40% while maintaining high clean accuracy. The framework highlights the importance of disrupting both semantic and perceptual gradient alignment in QNNs to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) are increasingly deployed in edge and resource-constrained environments due to their efficiency in computation and memory usage. While shown to distort the gradient landscape and weaken conventional pixel-level attacks, it provides limited robustness against patch-based adversarial attacks-localized, high-saliency perturbations that remain surprisingly transferable across bit-widths. Existing defenses either overfit to fixed quantization settings or fail to address this cross-bit generalization vulnerability. We introduce \textbf{TriQDef}, a tri-level quantization-aware defense framework designed to disrupt the transferability of patch-based adversarial attacks across QNNs. TriQDef consists of: (1) a Feature Disalignment Penalty (FDP) that enforces semantic inconsistency by penalizing perceptual similarity in intermediate representations; (2) a Gradient Perceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) that explicitly misaligns input gradients across bit-widths by minimizing structural and directional agreement via Edge IoU and HOG Cosine metrics; and (3) a Joint Quantization-Aware Training Protocol that unifies these penalties within a shared-weight training scheme across multiple quantization levels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that TriQDef reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) by over 40\% on unseen patch and quantization combinations, while preserving high clean accuracy. Our findings underscore the importance of disrupting both semantic and perceptual gradient alignment to mitigate patch transferability in QNNs.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a fine-tuning method for Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) that balances fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing from continual learning literature, the method combines regularization techniques to efficiently preserve the pretrained VLM's capabilities during fine-tuning. The study emphasizes the importance of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning for reproducibility and generalization across datasets and pretrained models. Experimental evaluations on image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in maintaining visual-text alignment without using text data or the original text encoder. The proposed approach consistently achieves strong results in both fine-grained and coarse-grained retrieval tasks. The code and model checkpoints are also made available for reference and further research. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale contrastive pre-training produces powerful Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) capable of generating representations (embeddings) effective for a wide variety of visual and multimodal tasks. However, these pretrained embeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where state-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated domain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to catastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose visual and cross-modal capabilities.
  In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve optimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the pretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual learning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization techniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective combination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet critical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure reproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained models. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and coarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks. Our approach consistently achieves strong results, notably retaining the visual-text alignment without utilizing any text data or the original text encoder during fine-tuning.

<div> Keywords: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance, Cine MRI, Implicit Neural Representation, KP-INR, k-space

Summary:
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging provides a non-invasive way to assess cardiac structure and function, with cine MRI capturing heart motion. Fast acquisition techniques have been used to reduce scan time, but they can lower image quality. Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods have shown promise in reconstructing high-quality images from undersampled data. The proposed KP-INR method for cardiac cine MRI reconstruction operates in k-space, with one branch focusing on positional embeddings and the other on local multi-scale k-space feature representations. By leveraging cross-branch interaction and approximating target k-space values from both branches, KP-INR demonstrates strong performance on challenging Cartesian k-space data. Experimental results on the CMRxRecon2024 dataset validate the improved performance of KP-INR over baseline models and indicate its potential in this area.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a non-invasive method for assessing cardiac structure, function, and blood flow. Cine MRI extends this by capturing heart motion, providing detailed insights into cardiac mechanics. To reduce scan time and breath-hold discomfort, fast acquisition techniques have been utilized at the cost of lowering image quality. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods have shown promise in unsupervised reconstruction by learning coordinate-to-value mappings from undersampled data, enabling high-quality image recovery. However, current existing INR methods primarily focus on using coordinate-based positional embeddings to learn the mapping, while overlooking the feature representations of the target point and its neighboring context. In this work, we propose KP-INR, a dual-branch INR method operating in k-space for cardiac cine MRI reconstruction: one branch processes the positional embedding of k-space coordinates, while the other learns from local multi-scale k-space feature representations at those coordinates. By enabling cross-branch interaction and approximating the target k-space values from both branches, KP-INR can achieve strong performance on challenging Cartesian k-space data. Experiments on the CMRxRecon2024 dataset confirms its improved performance over baseline models and highlights its potential in this field.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, memorization, image generation, segmentation, mitigation <br />

Summary: 
Foreground Background Memorization (FB-Mem) is introduced as a metric to identify and quantify memorized regions in generated images by diffusion models. It reveals that memorization in these models is more extensive than previously thought, with complex patterns linking individual generations to clusters of similar training images. Current mitigation methods, like neuron deactivation and pruning, are found to be ineffective in eliminating local memorization, especially in foreground regions. The study highlights the need for stronger mitigation strategies, suggesting a clustering approach as a potential solution. The framework provided by FB-Mem offers a comprehensive way to measure memorization in diffusion models, addressing limitations in existing detection methods and proposing new pathways for improving model performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) memorize training images and can reproduce near-duplicates during generation. Current detection methods identify verbatim memorization but fail to capture two critical aspects: quantifying partial memorization occurring in small image regions, and memorization patterns beyond specific prompt-image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose Foreground Background Memorization (FB-Mem), a novel segmentation-based metric that classifies and quantifies memorized regions within generated images. Our method reveals that memorization is more pervasive than previously understood: (1) individual generations from single prompts may be linked to clusters of similar training images, revealing complex memorization patterns that extend beyond one-to-one correspondences; and (2) existing model-level mitigation methods, such as neuron deactivation and pruning, fail to eliminate local memorization, which persists particularly in foreground regions. Our work establishes an effective framework for measuring memorization in diffusion models, demonstrates the inadequacy of current mitigation approaches, and proposes a stronger mitigation method using a clustering approach.

Abstract: Emotion is a critical component of artificial social intelligence. However, while current methods excel in lip synchronization and image quality, they often fail to generate accurate and controllable emotional expressions while preserving the subject's identity. To address this challenge, we introduce RealTalk, a novel framework for synthesizing emotional talking heads with high emotion accuracy, enhanced emotion controllability, and robust identity preservation. RealTalk employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate 3D facial landmarks from driving audio, which are concatenated with emotion-label embeddings using a ResNet-based landmark deformation model (LDM) to produce emotional landmarks. These landmarks and facial blendshape coefficients jointly condition a novel tri-plane attention Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to synthesize highly realistic emotional talking heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealTalk outperforms existing methods in emotion accuracy, controllability, and identity preservation, advancing the development of socially intelligent AI systems.

Summary: <br />
RF sensing has become a popular method for indoor perception, offering privacy advantages over vision-based systems. The WaveVerse framework is introduced to simulate realistic RF signals in indoor environments with human motions. It utilizes a language-guided 4D world generator and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator to generate accurate RF signals. The framework is effective in conditioned human motion generation and demonstrates the application of phase coherence in beamforming and respiration monitoring. Two case studies show the potential of WaveVerse in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity recognition, showcasing performance gains in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios. WaveVerse not only enables data generation for RF imaging but also improves performance in various indoor perception tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However, collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

<div> Keywords: 3D scene understanding, feature lifting, sparse linear inverse problem, regularization strategies, open-vocabulary 3D segmentation benchmarks

Summary:
Feature lifting plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding by attaching rich image feature descriptors to splat-based 3D representations. Addressing the challenge of assigning rich attributes to 3D primitives, a unified, kernel- and feature-agnostic formulation as a sparse linear inverse problem has been presented. This formulation allows for efficient closed-form solutions and guarantees a global optimal error upper bound under convex losses for high-quality lifted features delivery. To handle inconsistencies and noise in multi-view observations, two regularization strategies are introduced. Tikhonov Guidance ensures numerical stability through soft diagonal dominance, and Post-Lifting Aggregation filters noisy inputs via feature clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate the approach's superiority over baselines on open-vocabulary 3D segmentation benchmarks, with the ability to produce lifted features in minutes. <div>

Abstract: Feature lifting has emerged as a crucial component in 3D scene understanding, enabling the attachment of rich image feature descriptors (e.g., DINO, CLIP) onto splat-based 3D representations. The core challenge lies in optimally assigning rich general attributes to 3D primitives while addressing the inconsistency issues from multi-view images. We present a unified, kernel- and feature-agnostic formulation of the feature lifting problem as a sparse linear inverse problem, which can be solved efficiently in closed form. Our approach admits a provable upper bound on the global optimal error under convex losses for delivering high quality lifted features. To address inconsistencies and noise in multi-view observations, we introduce two complementary regularization strategies to stabilize the solution and enhance semantic fidelity. Tikhonov Guidance enforces numerical stability through soft diagonal dominance, while Post-Lifting Aggregation filters noisy inputs via feature clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary 3D segmentation benchmarks, outperforming training-based, grouping-based, and heuristic-forward baselines while producing the lifted features in minutes.

<div> Keywords: ultrasound computed tomography, generative neural physics framework, musculoskeletal imaging, deep learning, tissue parameters<br />
Summary:<br />
Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is a promising modality for musculoskeletal imaging, but traditional reconstructions often overlook strong scattering. This study introduces a novel approach that combines generative networks with physics-informed neural simulation to enhance 3D USCT imaging. By training on a small dataset of cross-modality images, the method achieves high-fidelity reconstructions of tissue parameters, providing detailed spatial maps beyond typical reflection images. The results on synthetic and in vivo data demonstrate the ability to accurately capture biomechanical properties in muscle and bone, with resolution comparable to MRI. By addressing computational challenges in highly scattering environments, this technique represents a significant advancement in USCT technology, bringing the potential for routine clinical evaluation of musculoskeletal diseases.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is a radiation-free, high-resolution modality but remains limited for musculoskeletal imaging due to conventional ray-based reconstructions that neglect strong scattering. We propose a generative neural physics framework that couples generative networks with physics-informed neural simulation for fast, high-fidelity 3D USCT. By learning a compact surrogate of ultrasonic wave propagation from only dozens of cross-modality images, our method merges the accuracy of wave modeling with the efficiency and stability of deep learning. This enables accurate quantitative imaging of in vivo musculoskeletal tissues, producing spatial maps of acoustic properties beyond reflection-mode images. On synthetic and in vivo data (breast, arm, leg), we reconstruct 3D maps of tissue parameters in under ten minutes, with sensitivity to biomechanical properties in muscle and bone and resolution comparable to MRI. By overcoming computational bottlenecks in strongly scattering regimes, this approach advances USCT toward routine clinical assessment of musculoskeletal disease.

Summary:
The article introduces a new Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset comprising of 14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise and corresponding ground truth annotations. The dataset includes two test sets - a synthesized test set and a real test set. An efficient baseline algorithm called Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network (WFANet) is proposed, utilizing a two-branch architecture to address weather noise in salient object detection. The weather prediction branch extracts weather-related deep features, while the saliency detection branch combines semantic features with weather features for improved performance. Comparative evaluations against 17 SOD methods demonstrate the superior performance of WFANet on the WXSOD dataset. The code and benchmark results of WFANet will be publicly available on GitHub for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of 14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network (WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture. Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at https://github.com/C-water/WXSOD

Abstract: Low-rank tensor representation (LRTR) has emerged as a powerful tool for multi-dimensional data processing. However, classical LRTR-based methods face two critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is low-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with significant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete meshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor Representation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling of multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our approach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation that semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics than holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This design not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances adaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel asymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific factor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized heads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local adaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel commonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation that is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with adaptability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCTR achieves 3-5 dB PSNR improvements over existing LRTR-based methods across multispectral images, videos, and color images.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&amp;P-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by discrete binary activations, offer high computational efficiency and low energy consumption, making them well-suited for computation-intensive tasks such as stereo image restoration. In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM) module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation. Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be available after the article is accepted.

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.

Abstract: The recent growth of large foundation models that can easily generate pseudo-labels for huge quantity of unlabeled data makes unsupervised Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Image Retrieval (UZS-CDIR) less relevant. In this paper, we therefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with noisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this end, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score from the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we design inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images into a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to alleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping function in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image features from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image features for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization ability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of learnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin, Sketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR consistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Improving Densification in 3D Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Rendering</title>

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved impressive performance in real-time rendering, its densification strategy often results in suboptimal reconstruction quality. In this work, we present a comprehensive improvement to the densification pipeline of 3DGS from three perspectives: when to densify, how to densify, and how to mitigate overfitting. Specifically, we propose an Edge-Aware Score to effectively select candidate Gaussians for splitting. We further introduce a Long-Axis Split strategy that reduces geometric distortions introduced by clone and split operations. To address overfitting, we design a set of techniques, including Recovery-Aware Pruning, Multi-step Update, and Growth Control. Our method enhances rendering fidelity without introducing additional training or inference overhead, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer Gaussians.

Abstract: The detection and segmentation of white blood cells in blood smear images is a key step in medical diagnostics, supporting various downstream tasks such as automated blood cell counting, morphological analysis, cell classification, and disease diagnosis and monitoring. Training robust and accurate models requires large amounts of labeled data, which is both time-consuming and expensive to acquire. In this work, we propose a novel approach for weakly supervised segmentation using neural cellular automata (NCA-WSS). By leveraging the feature maps generated by NCA during classification, we can extract segmentation masks without the need for retraining with segmentation labels. We evaluate our method on three white blood cell microscopy datasets and demonstrate that NCA-WSS significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches. Our work illustrates the potential of NCA for both classification and segmentation in a weakly supervised framework, providing a scalable and efficient solution for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) offer a robust and interpretable approach to image classification, making them a promising choice for microscopy image analysis. However, a performance gap remains between NCA and larger, more complex architectures. We address this challenge by integrating attention pooling with NCA to enhance feature extraction and improve classification accuracy. The attention pooling mechanism refines the focus on the most informative regions, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our method on eight diverse microscopy image datasets and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing NCA methods while remaining parameter-efficient and explainable. Furthermore, we compare our method with traditional lightweight convolutional neural network and vision transformer architectures, showing improved performance while maintaining a significantly lower parameter count. Our results highlight the potential of NCA-based models an alternative for explainable image classification.

Abstract: Radar-based object detection is essential for autonomous driving due to radar's long detection range. However, the sparsity of radar point clouds, especially at long range, poses challenges for accurate detection. Existing methods increase point density through temporal aggregation with ego-motion compensation, but this approach introduces scatter from dynamic objects, degrading detection performance. We propose DoppDrive, a novel Doppler-Driven temporal aggregation method that enhances radar point cloud density while minimizing scatter. Points from previous frames are shifted radially according to their dynamic Doppler component to eliminate radial scatter, with each point assigned a unique aggregation duration based on its Doppler and angle to minimize tangential scatter. DoppDrive is a point cloud density enhancement step applied before detection, compatible with any detector, and we demonstrate that it significantly improves object detection performance across various detectors and datasets.

<title>Geometry-Aware Video Inpainting for Joint Headset Occlusion Removal and Face Reconstruction in Social XR</title>

Abstract: Head-mounted displays (HMDs) are essential for experiencing extended reality (XR) environments and observing virtual content. However, they obscure the upper part of the user's face, complicating external video recording and significantly impacting social XR applications such as teleconferencing, where facial expressions and eye gaze details are crucial for creating an immersive experience. This study introduces a geometry-aware learning-based framework to jointly remove HMD occlusions and reconstruct complete 3D facial geometry from RGB frames captured from a single viewpoint. The method integrates a GAN-based video inpainting network, guided by dense facial landmarks and a single occlusion-free reference frame, to restore missing facial regions while preserving identity. Subsequently, a SynergyNet-based module regresses 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from the inpainted frames, enabling accurate 3D face reconstruction. Dense landmark optimization is incorporated throughout the pipeline to improve both the inpainting quality and the fidelity of the recovered geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully remove HMDs from RGB facial videos while maintaining facial identity and realism, producing photorealistic 3D face geometry outputs. Ablation studies further show that the framework remains robust across different landmark densities, with only minor quality degradation under sparse landmark configurations.

<title>Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector for Image Forgery Identification</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The severe image degradation in underwater environments impairs object detection models, as traditional image enhancement methods are often not optimized for such downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AquaFeat, a novel, plug-and-play module that performs task-driven feature enhancement. Our approach integrates a multi-scale feature enhancement network trained end-to-end with the detector's loss function, ensuring the enhancement process is explicitly guided to refine features most relevant to the detection task. When integrated with YOLOv8m on challenging underwater datasets, AquaFeat achieves state-of-the-art Precision (0.877) and Recall (0.624), along with competitive mAP scores (mAP@0.5 of 0.677 and mAP@[0.5:0.95] of 0.421). By delivering these accuracy gains while maintaining a practical processing speed of 46.5 FPS, our model provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for real-world applications, such as marine ecosystem monitoring and infrastructure inspection.

<title>MBMamba: When Memory Buffer Meets Mamba for Structure-Aware Image Deblurring</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12346</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative to CNNs and Transformers for image deblurring. However, its flatten-and-scan strategy often results in local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy, limiting its ability to effectively aggregate 2D spatial information. Although existing methods mitigate this by modifying the scan strategy or incorporating local feature modules, it increase computational complexity and hinder real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a structure-aware image deblurring network without changing the original Mamba architecture. Specifically, we design a memory buffer mechanism to preserve historical information for later fusion, enabling reliable modeling of relevance between adjacent features. Additionally, we introduce an Ising-inspired regularization loss that simulates the energy minimization of the physical system's "mutual attraction" between pixels, helping to maintain image structure and coherence. Building on this, we develop MBMamba. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on widely used benchmarks.

<title>EgoLoc: A Generalizable Solution for Temporal Interaction Localization in Egocentric Videos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12349</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how to interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

<title>Synthetic Data is Sufficient for Zero-Shot Visual Generalization from Offline Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12356</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces (Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents in the future.

Abstract: Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.

Abstract: Ensemble-based attacks have been proven to be effective in enhancing adversarial transferability by aggregating the outputs of models with various architectures. However, existing research primarily focuses on refining ensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration of ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To address this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate models, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce the risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision Transformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on the idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack method tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates augmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head dropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated parameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented models are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we introduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack significantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based attacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.

<title>DeCoT: Decomposing Complex Instructions for Enhanced Text-to-Image Generation with Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12396</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements, current Text-to-Image (T2I) models struggle with complex, long-form textual instructions, frequently failing to accurately render intricate details, spatial relationships, or specific constraints. This limitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal deficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To address this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models' understanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core stages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement, where an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic units and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and Adaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or optimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and substantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all evaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like "Text" and "Composition". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators (Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with Infinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline Infinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each DeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual quality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between high-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and accurate image generation.

arXiv:2508.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt learning has propelled vision-language models like CLIP to excel in diverse tasks, making them ideal for federated learning due to computational efficiency. However, conventional approaches that rely solely on final-layer features miss out on rich multi-scale visual cues and domain-specific style variations in decentralized client data. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedCSAP (Federated Cross-Modal Style-Aware Prompt Generation). Our framework harnesses low, mid, and high-level features from CLIP's vision encoder alongside client-specific style indicators derived from batch-level statistics. By merging intricate visual details with textual context, FedCSAP produces robust, context-aware prompt tokens that are both distinct and non-redundant, thereby boosting generalization across seen and unseen classes. Operating within a federated learning paradigm, our approach ensures data privacy through local training and global aggregation, adeptly handling non-IID class distributions and diverse domain-specific styles. Comprehensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets confirm that FedCSAP outperforms existing federated prompt learning methods in both accuracy and overall generalization.

arXiv:2508.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) continue to face challenges in complex visual reasoning tasks that demand deep contextual understanding, multi-angle analysis, or meticulous detail recognition. Existing approaches often rely on single-shot image encoding and prompts, limiting their ability to fully capture nuanced visual information. Inspired by the notion that strategically generated "additional" information can serve as beneficial contextual augmentation, we propose Multi-Perspective Contextual Augmentation for Reasoning (MPCAR), a novel inference-time strategy designed to enhance LVLM performance. MPCAR operates in three stages: first, an LVLM generates N diverse and complementary descriptions or preliminary reasoning paths from various angles; second, these descriptions are intelligently integrated with the original question to construct a comprehensive context-augmented prompt; and finally, this enriched prompt guides the ultimate LVLM for deep reasoning and final answer generation. Crucially, MPCAR achieves these enhancements without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying LVLM's parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and ScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms established baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant accuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual understanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and completeness of the generated answers. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of diverse prompt templates and the number of generated perspectives. This work underscores the efficacy of leveraging LVLMs' inherent generative capabilities to enrich input contexts, thereby unlocking their latent reasoning potential for complex multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in scene understanding, enhancing the explainability of driving behaviors and interactivity with users. Existing methods primarily fine-tune VLMs on on-board multi-view images and scene reasoning text, but this approach often lacks the holistic and nuanced scene recognition and powerful spatial awareness required for autonomous driving, especially in complex situations. To address this gap, we propose a novel vision-language framework tailored for autonomous driving, called LMAD. Our framework emulates modern end-to-end driving paradigms by incorporating comprehensive scene understanding and a task-specialized structure with VLMs. In particular, we introduce preliminary scene interaction and specialized expert adapters within the same driving task structure, which better align VLMs with autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, our approach is designed to be fully compatible with existing VLMs while seamlessly integrating with planning-oriented driving systems. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM and nuScenes-QA datasets demonstrate that LMAD significantly boosts the performance of existing VLMs on driving reasoning tasks,setting a new standard in explainable autonomous driving.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) has advanced remote sensing (RS) analysis by leveraging unlabeled data through pseudo-labeling and consistency learning. However, existing S4 studies often rely on small-scale datasets and models, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we propose S5, the first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS, which unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically underutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing large-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that integrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the RS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by pre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive corpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and object detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which enables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters. This approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across diverse RS benchmarks. The resulting RSFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, underscoring the viability of scaling semi-supervised learning for RS applications. All datasets, code, and models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/S5

Abstract: Liver Cirrhosis plays a critical role in the prognosis of chronic liver disease. Early detection and timely intervention are critical in significantly reducing mortality rates. However, the intricate anatomical architecture and diverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection and characterization of lesions in clinical settings. Existing methods underutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby hindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to model the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI volumes. By integrating the Spatial Anatomy-Based Mamba module (SABMamba), SRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and combines anatomical information from the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes to construct a global spatial context representation, enabling efficient volumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we introduce the Spatial Reverse Attention module (SRMA), designed to progressively refine cirrhotic details in the segmentation map, utilizing both the coarse segmentation map and hierarchical encoding features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRMA-Mamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in 3D pathological liver segmentation.

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a \textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model} based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

<title>Illusions in Humans and AI: How Visual Perception Aligns and Diverges</title>

Abstract: By comparing biological and artificial perception through the lens of illusions, we highlight critical differences in how each system constructs visual reality. Understanding these divergences can inform the development of more robust, interpretable, and human-aligned artificial intelligence (AI) vision systems. In particular, visual illusions expose how human perception is based on contextual assumptions rather than raw sensory data. As artificial vision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask: does AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions? This article explores how AI responds to classic visual illusions that involve color, size, shape, and motion. We find that some illusion-like effects can emerge in these models, either through targeted training or as by-products of pattern recognition. In contrast, we also identify illusions unique to AI, such as pixel-level sensitivity and hallucinations, that lack human counterparts. By systematically comparing human and AI responses to visual illusions, we uncover alignment gaps and AI-specific perceptual vulnerabilities invisible to human perception. These findings provide insights for future research on vision systems that preserve human-beneficial perceptual biases while avoiding distortions that undermine trust and safety.

<title>Adversarial Attacks on VQA-NLE: Exposing and Alleviating Inconsistencies in Visual Question Answering Explanations</title>

arXiv:2508.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language explanations in visual question answering (VQA-NLE) aim to make black-box models more transparent by elucidating their decision-making processes. However, we find that existing VQA-NLE systems can produce inconsistent explanations and reach conclusions without genuinely understanding the underlying context, exposing weaknesses in either their inference pipeline or explanation-generation mechanism. To highlight these vulnerabilities, we not only leverage an existing adversarial strategy to perturb questions but also propose a novel strategy that minimally alters images to induce contradictory or spurious outputs. We further introduce a mitigation method that leverages external knowledge to alleviate these inconsistencies, thereby bolstering model robustness. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks and two widely used VQA-NLE models underscore the effectiveness of our attacks and the potential of knowledge-based defenses, ultimately revealing pressing security and reliability concerns in current VQA-NLE systems.

Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is crucial for diagnosing pulmonary and cardiac diseases, yet its interpretation demands extensive clinical experience and suffers from inter-observer variability. While deep learning models offer high diagnostic accuracy, their black-box nature hinders clinical adoption in high-stakes medical settings. To address this, we propose X-Ray-CoT (Chest X-Ray Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework leveraging Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for intelligent chest X-ray diagnosis and interpretable report generation. X-Ray-CoT simulates human radiologists' "chain-of-thought" by first extracting multi-modal features and visual concepts, then employing an LLM-based component with a structured Chain-of-Thought prompting strategy to reason and produce detailed natural language diagnostic reports. Evaluated on the CORDA dataset, X-Ray-CoT achieves competitive quantitative performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 80.52% and F1 score of 78.65% for disease diagnosis, slightly surpassing existing black-box models. Crucially, it uniquely generates high-quality, explainable reports, as validated by preliminary human evaluations. Our ablation studies confirm the integral role of each proposed component, highlighting the necessity of multi-modal fusion and CoT reasoning for robust and transparent medical AI. This work represents a significant step towards trustworthy and clinically actionable AI systems in medical imaging.

<title>Inverse-LLaVA: Eliminating Alignment Pre-training Through Text-to-Vision Mapping</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional multimodal learning approaches require expensive alignment pre-training to bridge vision and language modalities, typically projecting visual features into discrete text token spaces. We challenge both fundamental assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of neuromuscular reflexes, such as the H-reflex, plays a critical role in sports science, rehabilitation, and clinical neurology. Traditional analysis of H-reflex EMG waveforms is subject to variability and interpretation bias among clinicians and researchers, limiting reliability and standardization. To address these challenges, we propose a Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) Consortium and a reasoning Large-Language Model (LLM)-enabled Decision Support System for automated H-reflex waveform interpretation and diagnosis. Our approach leverages multiple VLMs, each fine-tuned on curated datasets of H-reflex EMG waveform images annotated with clinical observations, recovery timelines, and athlete metadata. These models are capable of extracting key electrophysiological features and predicting neuromuscular states, including fatigue, injury, and recovery, directly from EMG images and contextual metadata. Diagnostic outputs from the VLM consortium are aggregated using a consensus-based method and refined by a specialized reasoning LLM, which ensures robust, transparent, and explainable decision support for clinicians and sports scientists. The end-to-end platform orchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning LLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning workflows using LLM Agents. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid system delivers highly accurate, consistent, and interpretable H-reflex assessments, significantly advancing the automation and standardization of neuromuscular diagnostics. To our knowledge, this work represents the first integration of a fine-tuned VLM consortium with a reasoning LLM for image-based H-reflex analysis, laying the foundation for next-generation AI-assisted neuromuscular assessment and athlete monitoring platforms.

Abstract: Skin cancer classification is a crucial task in medical image analysis, where precise differentiation between malignant and non-malignant lesions is essential for early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explore Sequential and Parallel Hybrid CNN-Transformer models with Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN). Our approach integrates transfer learning and extensive data augmentation, where CNNs extract local spatial features, Transformers model global dependencies, and CKAN facilitates nonlinear feature fusion for improved representation learning. To assess generalization, we evaluate our models on multiple benchmark datasets (HAM10000,BCN20000 and PAD-UFES) under varying data distributions and class imbalances. Experimental results demonstrate that hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures effectively capture both spatial and contextual features, leading to improved classification performance. Additionally, the integration of CKAN enhances feature fusion through learnable activation functions, yielding more discriminative representations. Our proposed approach achieves competitive performance in skin cancer classification, demonstrating 92.81% accuracy and 92.47% F1-score on the HAM10000 dataset, 97.83% accuracy and 97.83% F1-score on the PAD-UFES dataset, and 91.17% accuracy with 91.79% F1- score on the BCN20000 dataset highlighting the effectiveness and generalizability of our model across diverse datasets. This study highlights the significance of feature representation and model design in advancing robust and accurate medical image classification.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age individuals. Early detection of DR can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to 95%, but a shortage of retinologists and challenges in timely examination complicate detection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus photographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical settings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to learn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a Responsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles across the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for preprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification models. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local dataset of 1,046 patients, unseen by both systems. RAIS-DR demonstrated significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by 6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as Disparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable performance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to reduce healthcare disparities. These results highlight RAIS-DR as a robust and ethically aligned solution for DR screening in clinical settings. The code, weights of RAIS-DR are available at https://gitlab.com/inteligencia-gubernamental-jalisco/jalisco-retinopathy with RAIL.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual and text modalities to enable multimodal understanding and generation. These models typically combine a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM) for text generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning method to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates to their weights. While LoRA has emerged as a powerful technique for fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates, current implementations assume a fixed rank, potentially limiting flexibility and efficiency across diverse tasks. This paper introduces \textit{LangVision-LoRA-NAS}, a novel framework that integrates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with LoRA to optimize VLMs for variable-rank adaptation. Our approach leverages NAS to dynamically search for the optimal LoRA rank configuration tailored to specific multimodal tasks, balancing performance and computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments using the LLaMA-3.2-11B model on several datasets, LangVision-LoRA-NAS demonstrates notable improvement in model performance while reducing fine-tuning costs. Our Base and searched fine-tuned models on LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct can be found \href{https://huggingface.co/collections/krishnateja95/llama-32-11b-vision-instruct-langvision-lora-nas-6786cac480357a6a6fcc59ee}{\textcolor{blue}{here}} and the code for LangVision-LoRA-NAS can be found \href{https://github.com/krishnateja95/LangVision-NAS}{\textcolor{blue}{here}}.

Abstract: Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps provide a structured, top-down abstraction that is crucial for autonomous-driving perception. In this work, we employ Cross-View Transformers (CVT) for learning to map camera images to three BEV's channels - road, lane markings, and planned trajectory - using a realistic simulator for urban driving. Our study examines generalization to unseen towns, the effect of different camera layouts, and two loss formulations (focal and L1). Using training data from only a town, a four-camera CVT trained with the L1 loss delivers the most robust test performance, evaluated in a new town. Overall, our results underscore CVT's promise for mapping camera inputs to reasonably accurate BEV maps.

<title>MuSACo: Multimodal Subject-Specific Selection and Adaptation for Expression Recognition with Co-Training</title>

Abstract: Personalized expression recognition (ER) involves adapting a machine learning model to subject-specific data for improved recognition of expressions with considerable interpersonal variability. Subject-specific ER can benefit significantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each domain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and robustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often overlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting subject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a multi-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on co-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities and multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo particularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health, such as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level nuances are crucial. MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and generates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning, in conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target samples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only confident target features are combined. Our experimental results on challenging multimodal ER datasets: BioVid and StressID, show that MuSACo can outperform UDA (blending) and state-of-the-art MSDA methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has intensified the challenge of detecting and interpreting visual forgeries, necessitating robust frameworks for image forgery detection while providing reasoning as well as localization. While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space, generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2) Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing). We compare the Vision Language Models against competitive baselines and analyze the reasoning provided by them.

<title>Structure-preserving Feature Alignment for Old Photo Colorization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in reference-based colorization by training on large-scale datasets. However, directly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap between natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a novel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature Alignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo colorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct processing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our primary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two images, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We achieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust to different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence to transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable structure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving mechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a frozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for old photo colorization, as confirmed by qualitative and quantitative metrics.

<title>Foundation Model for Skeleton-Based Human Action Understanding</title>

Abstract: Human action understanding serves as a foundational pillar in the field of intelligent motion perception. Skeletons serve as a modality- and device-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action understanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and interaction. \RED{However, existing works often lack the scalability and generalization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks. There is no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action understanding tasks}. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training. The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the learning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments on 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks, covering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction. Our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We hope that this work would broaden the scope of research in skeleton-based action understanding and encourage more attention to dense prediction tasks.

<title>Multimodal Chain of Continuous Thought for Latent-Space Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>

arXiv:2508.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning as word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for multimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information dynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal Chain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a joint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning state is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and aligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective cognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language model`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning, and MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen cross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on benchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently improves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong baselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a promising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a scalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems built on Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant promise, yet their reliance on autoregressive architectures introduces some limitations for real-world applications. The sequential, token-by-token generation process of these models results in high inference latency and cannot perform bidirectional reasoning, making them unsuitable for dynamic, safety-critical environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ViLaD, a novel Large Vision Language Diffusion (LVLD) framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that represents a paradigm shift. ViLaD leverages a masked diffusion model that enables parallel generation of entire driving decision sequences, significantly reducing computational latency. Moreover, its architecture supports bidirectional reasoning, allowing the model to consider both past and future simultaneously, and supports progressive easy-first generation to iteratively improve decision quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, where ViLaD outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive VLM baselines in both planning accuracy and inference speed, while achieving a near-zero failure rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability through a real-world deployment on an autonomous vehicle for an interactive parking task, confirming its effectiveness and soundness for practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have introduced a paradigm shift for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) from unexplainable image quality scoring to explainable IQA, demonstrating practical applications like quality control and optimization guidance. However, current explainable IQA methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding, detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework. This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing GPT-4o.

Abstract: Optical motion capture is a foundational technology driving advancements in cutting-edge fields such as virtual reality and film production. However, system performance suffers severely under large-scale marker occlusions common in real-world applications. An in-depth analysis identifies two primary limitations of current models: (i) the lack of training datasets accurately reflecting realistic marker occlusion patterns, and (ii) the absence of training strategies designed to capture long-range dependencies among markers. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the CMU-Occlu dataset, which incorporates ray tracing techniques to realistically simulate practical marker occlusion patterns. Furthermore, we propose OpenMoCap, a novel motion-solving model designed specifically for robust motion capture in environments with significant occlusions. Leveraging a marker-joint chain inference mechanism, OpenMoCap enables simultaneous optimization and construction of deep constraints between markers and joints. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that OpenMoCap consistently outperforms competing methods across diverse scenarios, while the CMU-Occlu dataset opens the door for future studies in robust motion solving. The proposed OpenMoCap is integrated into the MoSen MoCap system for practical deployment. The code is released at: https://github.com/qianchen214/OpenMoCap.

Abstract: Pursuing a continuous visual representation that offers flexible frequency modulation and fast rendering speed has recently garnered increasing attention in the fields of 3D vision and graphics. However, existing representations often rely on frequency guidance or complex neural network decoding, leading to spectrum loss or slow rendering. To address these limitations, we propose WIPES, a universal Wavelet-based vIsual PrimitivES for representing multi-dimensional visual signals. Building on the spatial-frequency localization advantages of wavelets, WIPES effectively captures both the low-frequency "forest" and the high-frequency "trees." Additionally, we develop a wavelet-based differentiable rasterizer to achieve fast visual rendering. Experimental results on various visual tasks, including 2D image representation, 5D static and 6D dynamic novel view synthesis, demonstrate that WIPES, as a visual primitive, offers higher rendering quality and faster inference than INR-based methods, and outperforms Gaussian-based representations in rendering quality.

Abstract: Creative image in advertising is the heart and soul of e-commerce platform. An eye-catching creative image can enhance the shopping experience for users, boosting income for advertisers and advertising revenue for platforms. With the advent of AIGC technology, advertisers can produce large quantities of creative images at minimal cost. However, they struggle to assess the creative quality to select. Existing methods primarily focus on creative ranking, which fails to address the need for explainable creative selection.
  In this work, we propose the first paradigm for explainable creative assessment and selection. Powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs), our approach integrates the assessment and selection of creative images into a natural language generation task. To facilitate this research, we construct CreativePair, the first comparative reasoning-induced creative dataset featuring 8k annotated image pairs, with each sample including a label indicating which image is superior. Additionally, we introduce Creative4U (pronounced Creative for You), a MLLMs-based creative selector that takes into account users' interests. Through Reason-to-Select RFT, which includes supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning, Creative4U is able to evaluate and select creative images accurately. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and dataset will be made public to advance research and industrial applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-time applications such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, which demand fast and reliable responses based on accurate perception. To meet these requirements, existing systems commonly employ cloud-edge collaborative architectures, such as partitioned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or task offloading strategies between Large and Small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs). However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this paradigm, we design SpotVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual grounding consistency. Extensive experiments on three real-time vision tasks across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The new paradigm lays the groundwork for more effective and latency-aware collaboration strategies in future VLM systems.

<title>Synthesizing Accurate and Realistic T1-weighted Contrast-Enhanced MR Images using Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow</title>

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is central to neuro-oncologic diagnosis but requires gadolinium-based agents, which add cost and scan time, raise environmental concerns, and may pose risks to patients. In this work, we propose a two-stage Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) pipeline for synthesizing volumetric CE brain MRI from non-contrast inputs. First, a patch-based 3D U-Net predicts the voxel-wise posterior mean (minimizing MSE). Then, this initial estimate is refined by a time-conditioned 3D rectified flow to incorporate realistic textures without compromising structural fidelity. We train this model on a multi-institutional collection of paired pre- and post-contrast T1w volumes (BraTS 2023-2025). On a held-out test set of 360 diverse volumes, our best refined outputs achieve an axial FID of $12.46$ and KID of $0.007$ ($\sim 68.7\%$ lower FID than the posterior mean) while maintaining low volumetric MSE of $0.057$ ($\sim 27\%$ higher than the posterior mean). Qualitative comparisons confirm that our method restores lesion margins and vascular details realistically, effectively navigating the perception-distortion trade-off for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained model to continually changing target domains during inference. As a fundamental principle, an ideal CTTA method should rapidly adapt to new domains (exploration) while retaining and exploiting knowledge from previously encountered domains to handle similar domains in the future. Despite significant advances, balancing exploration and exploitation in CTTA is still challenging: 1) Existing methods focus on adjusting predictions based on deep-layer outputs of neural networks. However, domain shifts typically affect shallow features, which are inefficient to be adjusted from deep predictions, leading to dilatory exploration; 2) A single model inevitably forgets knowledge of previous domains during the exploration, making it incapable of exploiting historical knowledge to handle similar future domains. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a mean teacher framework that strikes an appropriate Balance between Exploration and Exploitation (BEE) during the CTTA process. For the former challenge, we introduce a Multi-level Consistency Regularization (MCR) loss that aligns the intermediate features of the student and teacher models, accelerating adaptation to the current domain. For the latter challenge, we employ a Complementary Anchor Replay (CAR) mechanism to reuse historical checkpoints (anchors), recovering complementary knowledge for diverse domains. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness for CTTA tasks.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of dynamic crowds in large scenes has become increasingly important for applications such as city surveillance and crowd analysis. However, current works attempt to reconstruct 3D crowds from a static image, causing a lack of temporal consistency and inability to alleviate the typical impact caused by occlusions. In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first framework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of individuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a coarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust crowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and severe occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based human motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The core of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term dynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals with similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous Motion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion segments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and plausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization and rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no existing well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual benchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction from large-scene videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large-scene dynamic crowd reconstruction task. The code and dataset will be available for research purposes.

<title>Stable Diffusion-Based Approach for Human De-Occlusion</title>

Abstract: Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task. De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions. The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as 2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: W\"olfflin's five principles offer a structured approach to analyzing stylistic variations for formal analysis. However, no existing metric effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP, on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.

Abstract: Despite their success, current training pipelines for reasoning VLMs focus on a limited range of tasks, such as mathematical and logical reasoning. As a result, these models face difficulties in generalizing their reasoning capabilities to a wide range of domains, primarily due to the scarcity of readily available and verifiable reward data beyond these narrowly defined areas. Moreover, integrating data from multiple domains is challenging, as the compatibility between domain-specific datasets remains uncertain. To address these limitations, we build a comprehensive RL-ready visual reasoning dataset from 46 data sources across 8 dimensions, covering a wide range of tasks such as infographic, mathematical, spatial, cross-image, graphic user interface, medical, common sense and general science. We propose an influence function based data selection and difficulty based filtering strategy to identify high-quality training samples from this dataset. Subsequently, we train the VLM, referred to as Vision-G1, using multi-round RL with a data curriculum to iteratively improve its visual reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across various visual reasoning benchmarks, outperforming similar-sized VLMs and even proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Flash. The model, code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/yuh-zha/Vision-G1.

Abstract: Multi-UAV collaborative 3D detection enables accurate and robust perception by fusing multi-view observations from aerial platforms, offering significant advantages in coverage and occlusion handling, while posing new challenges for computation on resource-constrained UAV platforms. In this paper, we present AdaBEV, a novel framework that learns adaptive instance-aware BEV representations through a refine-and-contrast paradigm. Unlike existing methods that treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement Module (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to enhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV grids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial subdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and background features via contrastive learning in BEV space. Extensive experiments on the Air-Co-Pred dataset demonstrate that AdaBEV achieves superior accuracy-computation trade-offs across model scales, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at low resolutions and approaching upper bound performance while maintaining low-resolution BEV inputs and negligible overhead.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) poses a challenge, requiring models to dynamically adapt and perform optimally on shifting target domains. This task is particularly emphasized in real-world driving scenes, where weather domain shifts occur frequently. To address such dynamic changes, our proposed method, TTA-DAME, leverages source domain data augmentation into target domains. Additionally, we introduce a domain discriminator and a specialized domain detector to mitigate drastic domain shifts, especially from daytime to nighttime conditions. To further improve adaptability, we train multiple detectors and consolidate their predictions through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Our empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, showing significant performance enhancements on the SHIFT Benchmark.

Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles often have varying camera sensor setups, which is inevitable due to restricted placement options for different vehicle types. Training a perception model on one particular setup and evaluating it on a new, different sensor setup reveals the so-called cross-sensor domain gap, typically leading to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this end, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA to specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant cross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model architecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the one hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most robust against varying sensor configurations. On the other hand, we propose a novel data-driven sensor adaptation pipeline based on neural rendering, which can transform entire datasets to match different camera sensor setups. Applying this approach improves performance across all investigated 3D object detectors, mitigating the cross-sensor domain gap by a large margin and reducing the need for new data collection by enabling efficient data reusability across vehicles with different sensor setups. The CamShift dataset and the sensor adaptation benchmark are available at https://dmholtz.github.io/camshift/.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal misinformation poses growing threats to public discourse and societal trust. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more resilient approaches in the GenAI era.

Abstract: Communication barriers pose significant challenges for individuals with hearing and speech impairments, often limiting their ability to effectively interact in everyday environments. This project introduces a real-time assistive technology solution that leverages advanced deep learning techniques to translate sign language gestures into textual and audible speech. By employing convolution neural networks (CNN) trained on the Sign Language MNIST dataset, the system accurately classifies hand gestures captured live via webcam. Detected gestures are instantaneously translated into their corresponding meanings and transcribed into spoken language using text-to-speech synthesis, thus facilitating seamless communication. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate high model accuracy and robust real-time performance with some latency, highlighting the system's practical applicability as an accessible, reliable, and user-friendly tool for enhancing the autonomy and integration of sign language users in diverse social settings.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable ability to synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions. To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models without further training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios, despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians, i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians. The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.

Abstract: Single image defocus deblurring aims to recover an all-in-focus image from a defocus counterpart, where accurately modeling spatially varying blur kernels remains a key challenge. Most existing methods rely on spatial features for kernel estimation, but their performance degrades in severely blurry regions where local high-frequency details are missing. To address this, we propose a Frequency-Driven Inverse Kernel Prediction network (FDIKP) that incorporates frequency-domain representations to enhance structural identifiability in kernel modeling. Given the superior discriminative capability of the frequency domain for blur modeling, we design a Dual-Branch Inverse Kernel Prediction (DIKP) strategy that improves the accuracy of kernel estimation while maintaining stability. Moreover, considering the limited number of predicted inverse kernels, we introduce a Position Adaptive Convolution (PAC) to enhance the adaptability of the deconvolution process. Finally, we propose a Dual-Domain Scale Recurrent Module (DSRM) to fuse deconvolution results and progressively improve deblurring quality from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Image set classification (ISC), which can be viewed as a task of comparing similarities between sets consisting of unordered heterogeneous images with variable quantities and qualities, has attracted growing research attention in recent years. How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore the similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging issues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image sets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning. Existing deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively adjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited performance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines traditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC approach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR) network to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature representations of each image set and the distance similarities between different sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep feature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The deep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn (local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is exploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each image set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by developing a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function. Extensive experiments on several well-known few-shot ISC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art image set classification algorithms.

Abstract: Shadow removal aims to restore images that are partially degraded by shadows, where the degradation is spatially localized and non-uniform. Unlike general restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy, which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.

Abstract: Computer vision models can be used to assist during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), but poor image quality often degrades performance. This work presents CLAIRE-DSA, a deep learning--based framework designed to categorize key image properties in minimum intensity projections (MinIPs) acquired during MT for AIS, supporting downstream quality control and workflow optimization. CLAIRE-DSA uses pre-trained ResNet backbone models, fine-tuned to predict nine image properties (e.g., presence of contrast, projection angle, motion artefact severity). Separate classifiers were trained on an annotated dataset containing $1,758$ fluoroscopic MinIPs. The model achieved excellent performance on all labels, with ROC-AUC ranging from $0.91$ to $0.98$, and precision ranging from $0.70$ to $1.00$. The ability of CLAIRE-DSA to identify suitable images was evaluated on a segmentation task by filtering poor quality images and comparing segmentation performance on filtered and unfiltered datasets. Segmentation success rate increased from $42%$ to $69%$, $p < 0.001$. CLAIRE-DSA demonstrates strong potential as an automated tool for accurately classifying image properties in DSA series of acute ischemic stroke patients, supporting image annotation and quality control in clinical and research applications.

<title>Harnessing Group-Oriented Consistency Constraints for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation in CdZnTe Semiconductors</title>

Abstract: Labeling Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor images is challenging due to the low-contrast defect boundaries, necessitating annotators to cross-reference multiple views. These views share a single ground truth (GT), forming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders advanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as they are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image is independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error accumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias. To address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented perspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency Augmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent consistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented baseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight, we introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency representation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module (VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware view through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module (VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information interaction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe materials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation model, we achieve a 70.6\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2 group-annotated data (5\textperthousand). The code is available at \href{https://github.com/pipixiapipi/ICAF}{https://github.com/pipixiapipi/ICAF}.

<title>SocialTrack: Multi-Object Tracking in Complex Urban Traffic Scenes Inspired by Social Behavior</title>

Abstract: As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT), UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems. However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.

<title>Leveraging Diffusion Models for Stylization using Multiple Style Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have enabled exciting progress in image style transfer. However, several key issues remain. For example, existing methods still struggle to accurately match styles. They are often limited in the number of style images that can be used. Furthermore, they tend to entangle content and style in undesired ways. To address this, we propose leveraging multiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent content leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both image prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the denoising process. With this, our approach is designed such that it can intervene both at the cross-attention and the self-attention layers of the denoising UNet. For the statistical alignment, we employ clustering to distill a small representative set of attention features from the large number of attention values extracted from the style samples. As demonstrated in our experimental section, the resulting method achieves state-of-the-art results for stylization.

Abstract: Transportation influence health by shaping exposure to physical activity, air pollution and injury risk.Comparative data on cycling and motorcycling behaviours is scarce, particularly at a global scale.Street view imagery, such as Google Street View (GSV), combined with computer vision, is a valuable resource for efficiently capturing travel behaviour data.This study demonstrates a novel approach using deep learning on street view images to estimate cycling and motorcycling levels across diverse cities worldwide.We utilized data from 185 global cities.The data on mode shares of cycling and motorcycling estimated using travel surveys or censuses.We used GSV images to detect cycles and motorcycles in sampled locations, using 8000 images per city.The YOLOv4 model, fine-tuned using images from six cities, achieved a mean average precision of 89% for detecting cycles and motorcycles in GSV images.A global prediction model was developed using beta regression with city-level mode shares as outcome, with log transformed explanatory variables of counts of GSV-detected images with cycles and motorcycles, while controlling for population density.We found strong correlations between GSV motorcycle counts and motorcycle mode share (0.78) and moderate correlations between GSV cycle counts and cycling mode share (0.51).Beta regression models predicted mode shares with $R^2$ values of 0.614 for cycling and 0.612 for motorcycling, achieving median absolute errors (MDAE) of 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.Scatterplots demonstrated consistent prediction accuracy, though cities like Utrecht and Cali were outliers.The model was applied to 60 cities globally for which we didn't have recent mode share data.We provided estimates for some cities in the Middle East, Latin America and East Asia.With computer vision, GSV images capture travel modes and activity, providing insights alongside traditional data sources.

Abstract: We present an application of computer vision methods to classify the light curves of eclipsing binaries (EB). We have used pre-trained models based on convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers ($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high accuracy ($>96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$, and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($>94\%$, up to $100\%$ for $TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly, revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30 -> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models will be released.

Abstract: Continuous and reliable underwater monitoring is essential for assessing marine biodiversity, detecting ecological changes and supporting autonomous exploration in aquatic environments. Underwater monitoring platforms rely on mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous navigation.

Abstract: This paper presents the winning approach for the 1st MultiModal Deception Detection (MMDD) Challenge at the 1st Workshop on Subtle Visual Computing (SVC). Aiming at the domain shift issue across source and target domains, we propose a Multi-source Multimodal Progressive Domain Adaptation (MMPDA) framework that transfers the audio-visual knowledge from diverse source domains to the target domain. By gradually aligning source and the target domain at both feature and decision levels, our method bridges domain shifts across diverse multimodal datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach securing Top-2 place. Our approach reaches 60.43% on accuracy and 56.99\% on F1-score on competition stage 2, surpassing the 1st place team by 5.59% on F1-score and the 3rd place teams by 6.75% on accuracy.

arXiv:2508.12861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on natural image and language data, such as CLIP, have exhibited significant potential in few-shot image recognition tasks, leading to development of various efficient transfer learning methods. These methods exploit inherent pre-learned knowledge in VLMs and have achieved strong performance on standard image datasets. However, their effectiveness is often limited when confronted with cross-domain tasks where imaging domains differ from natural images. To address this limitation, we propose Consistency-guided Multi-view Collaborative Optimization (CoMuCo), a novel fine-tuning strategy for VLMs. This strategy employs two functionally complementary expert modules to extract multi-view features, while incorporating prior knowledge-based consistency constraints and information geometry-based consensus mechanisms to enhance the robustness of feature learning. Additionally, a new cross-domain few-shot benchmark is established to help comprehensively evaluate methods on imaging domains distinct from natural images. Extensive empirical evaluations on both existing and newly proposed benchmarks suggest CoMuCo consistently outperforms current methods in few-shot tasks. The code and benchmark will be released.

<title>Preserve and Sculpt: Manifold-Aligned Fine-tuning of Vision-Language Models for Few-Shot Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12877</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown remarkable potential in few-shot image classification and led to numerous effective transfer learning strategies. These methods leverage the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to enable effective domain adaptation while mitigating overfitting through parameter-efficient tuning or instance-based consistency constraints. However, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data distribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning method, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the data distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning explicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further sculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves both macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original manifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning. Theoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text modalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the manifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively preserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released.

arXiv:2508.12880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success but their large size poses deployment challenges. While various pruning techniques exist, many involve complex iterative processes, specialized criteria, or struggle to maintain sparsity effectively during training. We introduce ONG (One-shot NMF-based Gradient Masking), a novel sparsification strategy that identifies salient weight structures using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for one-shot pruning at the outset of training. Subsequently, ONG employs a precise gradient masking mechanism to ensure that only unpruned weights are updated, strictly preserving the target sparsity throughout the training phase. We integrate ONG into the BIMP comparative framework and evaluate it on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with ResNet56, ResNet34, and ResNet18 against established stable sparsification methods. Our experiments demonstrate ONG's ability to achieve comparable or superior performance at various sparsity levels while maintaining structural integrity post-pruning and offering a clear mechanism for targeting desired sparsities.

Abstract: Generative modelling of entire CT volumes conditioned on clinical reports has the potential to accelerate research through data augmentation, privacy-preserving synthesis and reducing regulator-constraints on patient data while preserving diagnostic signals. With the recent release of CT-RATE, a large-scale collection of 3D CT volumes paired with their respective clinical reports, training large text-conditioned CT volume generation models has become achievable. In this work, we introduce CTFlow, a 0.5B latent flow matching transformer model, conditioned on clinical reports. We leverage the A-VAE from FLUX to define our latent space, and rely on the CT-Clip text encoder to encode the clinical reports. To generate consistent whole CT volumes while keeping the memory constraints tractable, we rely on a custom autoregressive approach, where the model predicts the first sequence of slices of the volume from text-only, and then relies on the previously generated sequence of slices and the text, to predict the following sequence. We evaluate our results against state-of-the-art generative CT model, and demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of temporal coherence, image diversity and text-image alignment, with FID, FVD, IS scores and CLIP score.

Abstract: Multi-modal methods based on camera and LiDAR sensors have garnered significant attention in the field of 3D detection. However, many prevalent works focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature extraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a multi-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to effectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic information. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space via a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the representation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral cross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and pseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR points. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to mitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D convolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point aware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from LiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal refinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an intersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel proposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with both high IoU and classification scores. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of our method on the KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets.

Abstract: Layout-guided text-to-image models offer greater control over the generation process by explicitly conditioning image synthesis on the spatial arrangement of elements. As a result, their adoption has increased in many computer vision applications, ranging from content creation to synthetic data generation. A critical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual prompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked, and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image generation. It features text-and-layout pairs spanning seven challenging scenarios, investigating object generation, color fidelity, attribute recognition, inter-object relationships, and spatial control. We propose an evaluation protocol that builds on existing frameworks by incorporating the layout alignment score to assess spatial accuracy. Using 7Bench, we evaluate several state-of-the-art diffusion models, uncovering their respective strengths and limitations across diverse alignment tasks. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Elizzo/7Bench.

<title>Towards High-Resolution Industrial Image Anomaly Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current anomaly detection methods primarily focus on low-resolution scenarios. For high-resolution images, conventional downsampling often results in missed detections of subtle anomalous regions due to the loss of fine-grained discriminative information. Despite some progress, recent studies have attempted to improve detection resolution by employing lightweight networks or using simple image tiling and ensemble methods. However, these approaches still struggle to meet the practical demands of industrial scenarios in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose HiAD, a general framework for high-resolution anomaly detection. HiAD is capable of detecting anomalous regions of varying sizes in high-resolution images under limited computational resources. Specifically, HiAD employs a dual-branch architecture that integrates anomaly cues across different scales to comprehensively capture both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Furthermore, it incorporates a multi-resolution feature fusion strategy to tackle the challenges posed by fine-grained texture variations in high-resolution images. To enhance both adaptability and efficiency, HiAD utilizes a detector pool in conjunction with various detector assignment strategies, enabling detectors to be adaptively assigned based on patch features, ensuring detection performance while effectively controlling computational costs. We conduct extensive experiments on our specifically constructed high-resolution anomaly detection benchmarks, including MVTec-HD, VisA-HD, and the real-world benchmark RealIAD-HD, demonstrating the superior performance of HiAD.

<title>SEDEG:Sequential Enhancement of Decoder and Encoder's Generality for Class Incremental Learning with Small Memory</title>

Abstract: In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for adapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially, SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation (KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of its components.

Abstract: Anatomic tracer studies are critical for validating and improving diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, large-scale analysis of data from such studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections, limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined, fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data, based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.

<title>Lumen: Consistent Video Relighting and Harmonious Background Replacement with Video Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Video relighting is a challenging yet valuable task, aiming to replace the background in videos while correspondingly adjusting the lighting in the foreground with harmonious blending. During translation, it is essential to preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen, an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos. To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground preservation.

<title>MaskSem: Semantic-Guided Masking for Learning 3D Hybrid High-Order Motion Representation</title>

Abstract: Human action recognition is a crucial task for intelligent robotics, particularly within the context of human-robot collaboration research. In self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based reconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the skeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data. However, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion patterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns. To address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking method for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel framework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of joints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal orgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore more discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order motion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order motion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion acceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach offers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process, enhancing the model's understanding of motion patterns. Experiments on the NTU60, NTU120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that MaskSem, combined with a vanilla transformer, improves skeleton-based action recognition, making it more suitable for applications in human-robot interaction.

<title>Breaking Reward Collapse: Adaptive Reinforcement for Open-ended Medical Reasoning with Enhanced Semantic Discrimination</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become an invaluable imaging modality in dentistry, enabling 3D visualization of teeth and surrounding structures for diagnosis and treatment planning. Automated segmentation of dental structures in CBCT can efficiently assist in identifying pathology (e.g., pulpal or periapical lesions) and facilitate radiation therapy planning in head and neck cancer patients. We describe the DLaBella29 team's approach for the MICCAI 2025 ToothFairy3 Challenge, which involves a deep learning pipeline for multi-class tooth segmentation. We utilized the MONAI Auto3DSeg framework with a 3D SegResNet architecture, trained on a subset of the ToothFairy3 dataset (63 CBCT scans) with 5-fold cross-validation. Key preprocessing steps included image resampling to 0.6 mm isotropic resolution and intensity clipping. We applied an ensemble fusion using Multi-Label STAPLE on the 5-fold predictions to infer a Phase 1 segmentation and then conducted tight cropping around the easily segmented Phase 1 mandible to perform Phase 2 segmentation on the smaller nerve structures. Our method achieved an average Dice of 0.87 on the ToothFairy3 challenge out-of-sample validation set. This paper details the clinical context, data preparation, model development, results of our approach, and discusses the relevance of automated dental segmentation for improving patient care in radiation oncology.

Abstract: Gaze communication plays a crucial role in daily social interactions. Quantifying this behavior can help in human-computer interaction and digital phenotyping. While end-to-end models exist for gaze target detection, they only utilize a single decoder to simultaneously localize human heads and predict their corresponding gaze (e.g., 2D points or heatmap) in a scene. This multitask learning approach generates a unified and entangled representation for human head localization and gaze location prediction. Herein, we propose GazeDETR, a novel end-to-end architecture with two disentangled decoders that individually learn unique representations and effectively utilize coherent attentive fields for each subtask. More specifically, we demonstrate that its human head predictor utilizes local information, while its gaze decoder incorporates both local and global information. Our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow, VideoAttentionTarget and ChildPlay datasets. It outperforms existing end-to-end models with a notable margin.

<title>Compact Attention: Exploiting Structured Spatio-Temporal Sparsity for Fast Video Generation</title>

Abstract: The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

<title>Dextr: Zero-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Singular Value Decomposition and Extrinsic Curvature</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12977</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) typically optimises the architecture search process by exploiting the network or gradient properties at initialisation through zero-cost proxies. The existing proxies often rely on labelled data, which is usually unavailable in real-world settings. Furthermore, the majority of the current methods focus either on optimising the convergence and generalisation attributes or solely on the expressivity of the network architectures. To address both limitations, we first demonstrate how channel collinearity affects the convergence and generalisation properties of a neural network. Then, by incorporating the convergence, generalisation and expressivity in one approach, we propose a zero-cost proxy that omits the requirement of labelled data for its computation. In particular, we leverage the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the neural network layer features and the extrinsic curvature of the network output to design our proxy. %As a result, the proposed proxy is formulated as the simplified harmonic mean of the logarithms of two key components: the sum of the inverse of the feature condition number and the extrinsic curvature of the network output. Our approach enables accurate prediction of network performance on test data using only a single label-free data sample. Our extensive evaluation includes a total of six experiments, including the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) search space, i.e. DARTS and the Transformer search space, i.e. AutoFormer. The proposed proxy demonstrates a superior performance on multiple correlation benchmarks, including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and TransNAS-Bench-101-micro; as well as on the NAS task within the DARTS and the AutoFormer search space, all while being notably efficient.

Abstract: The development of smart cities has led to the generation of massive amounts of multi-modal data in the context of a range of tasks that enable a comprehensive monitoring of the smart city infrastructure and services. This paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally, MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection, modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation. Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities, laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth (D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT), covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets, revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal categories when compared with RGB datasets.

<title>Empirical Evidences for the Effects of Feature Diversity in Open Set Recognition and Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) and continual learning are two critical challenges in machine learning, focusing respectively on detecting novel classes at inference time and updating models to incorporate the new classes. While many recent approaches have addressed these problems, particularly OSR, by heuristically promoting feature diversity, few studies have directly examined the role that feature diversity plays in tackling them. In this work, we provide empirical evidence that enhancing feature diversity improves the recognition of open set samples. Moreover, increased feature diversity also facilitates both the retention of previously learned data and the integration of new data in continual learning. We hope our findings can inspire further research into both practical methods and theoretical understanding in these domains.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to overcome occlusion and limited sensor range by sharing intermediate features. Yet transmitting dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps can overwhelm the bandwidth available for inter-vehicle communication. We present SlimComm, a communication-efficient framework that integrates 4D radar Doppler with a query-driven sparse scheme. SlimComm builds a motion-centric dynamic map to distinguish moving from static objects and generates two query types: (i) reference queries on dynamic and high-confidence regions, and (ii) exploratory queries probing occluded areas via a two-stage offset. Only query-specific BEV features are exchanged and fused through multi-scale gated deformable attention, reducing payload while preserving accuracy. For evaluation, we release OPV2V-R and Adver-City-R, CARLA-based datasets with per-point Doppler radar. SlimComm achieves up to 90% lower bandwidth than full-map sharing while matching or surpassing prior baselines across varied traffic densities and occlusions. Dataset and code will be available at: https://url.fzi.de/SlimComm.

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generations have demonstrated diffusion model's potential as world models by capturing complex physical dynamics and interactive behaviors. However, existing interactive world models depend on bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.

Abstract: While exocentric video synthesis has achieved great progress, egocentric video generation remains largely underexplored, which requires modeling first-person view content along with camera motion patterns induced by the wearer's body movements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion; 2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel metrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the EgoTwin framework.

Abstract: Deep learning-based cardiac MRI reconstruction faces significant domain shift challenges when deployed across multiple clinical centers with heterogeneous scanner configurations and imaging protocols. We propose HierAdaptMR, a hierarchical feature adaptation framework that addresses multi-level domain variations through parameter-efficient adapters. Our method employs Protocol-Level Adapters for sequence-specific characteristics and Center-Level Adapters for scanner-dependent variations, built upon a variational unrolling backbone. A Universal Adapter enables generalization to entirely unseen centers through stochastic training that learns center-invariant adaptations. The framework utilizes multi-scale SSIM loss with frequency domain enhancement and contrast-adaptive weighting for robust optimization. Comprehensive evaluation on the CMRxRecon2025 dataset spanning 5+ centers, 10+ scanners, and 9 modalities demonstrates superior cross-center generalization while maintaining reconstruction quality. code: https://github.com/Ruru-Xu/HierAdaptMR

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from images, for example, with 3D Gaussian splatting, has made great progress. Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.

Abstract: Human shape editing enables controllable transformation of a person's body shape, such as thin, muscular, or overweight, while preserving pose, identity, clothing, and background. Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced rapidly, shape editing remains relatively underexplored. Current approaches typically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing unrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background inconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is the lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and evaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically designed for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in body shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent identity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose Odo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive body reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a frozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from the input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target SMPL depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches, achieving per-vertex reconstruction errors as low as 7.5mm, significantly lower than the 13.6mm observed in baseline methods, while producing realistic results that accurately match the desired target shapes.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage multimodal framework that enhances disease classification and region-aware radiology report generation from chest X-rays, leveraging the MIMIC-Eye dataset. In the first stage, we introduce a gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment. Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall, highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance and the interpretability of generated medical reports.

Abstract: Nowadays, the development of a Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) system for ID cards presents a challenge due to the lack of images available to train a robust PAD system and the increase in diversity of possible attack instrument species. Today, most algorithms focus on generating attack samples and do not take into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of the first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating synthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the generalisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images generated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial solution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our images as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and data restrictions.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) presents unique challenges in ensuring that model decisions are both understandable and grounded in visual content. Current models often suffer from a lack of interpretability and explainability, as well as from biases in dataset distributions that lead to shortcut learning. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel RSVQA dataset, Chessboard, designed to minimize biases through 3'123'253 questions and a balanced answer distribution. Each answer is linked to one or more cells within the image, enabling fine-grained visual reasoning.
  Building on this dataset, we develop an explainable and interpretable model called Checkmate that identifies the image cells most relevant to its decisions. Through extensive experiments across multiple model architectures, we show that our approach improves transparency and supports more trustworthy decision-making in RSVQA systems.

<title>DMS:Diffusion-Based Multi-Baseline Stereo Generation for Improving Self-Supervised Depth Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13091</link>

Abstract: While supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation have advanced significantly with learning-based algorithms, self-supervised methods using stereo images as supervision signals have received relatively less focus and require further investigation. A primary challenge arises from ambiguity introduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing corresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as occlusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit photometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that utilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along the epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we finetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions: left-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the right camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right cameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit photometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play'' method that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both training and synthesizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with up to 35% outlier reduction and state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

<title>Real-Time Beach Litter Detection and Counting: A Comparative Analysis of RT-DETR Model Variants</title>

Abstract: Coastal pollution is a pressing global environmental issue, necessitating scalable and automated solutions for monitoring and management. This study investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a state-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated detection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU (mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's 0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs between model complexity and operational viability.

<title>Precise Action-to-Video Generation Through Visual Action Prompts</title>

Abstract: We present visual action prompts, a unified action representation for action-to-video generation of complex high-DoF interactions while maintaining transferable visual dynamics across domains. Action-driven video generation faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions (HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/VAP/.

Abstract: This work studies the challenge of transfer animations between characters whose skeletal topologies differ substantially. While many techniques have advanced retargeting techniques in decades, transfer motions across diverse topologies remains less-explored. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent topological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts the establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides, the current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different topological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel, training-free framework. Simply yet effectively, Motion2Motion works with only one or a few example motions on the target skeleton, by accessing a sparse set of bone correspondences between the source and target skeletons. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that Motion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both similar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios. The practical utility of our approach is further evidenced by its successful integration in downstream applications and user interfaces, highlighting its potential for industrial applications. Code and data are available at https://lhchen.top/Motion2Motion.

Abstract: Multi-modal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, which are fundamental capabilities to achieving artificial general intelligence. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and discuss the challenges in ensuring fair evaluation. We then evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2) still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. Moreover, we (3) identify the more challenging spatial intelligence problems for multi-modal models, and (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult problems. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans yet fail even the most advanced multi-modal models.

<title>IGFuse: Interactive 3D Gaussian Scene Reconstruction via Multi-Scans Fusion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing complete and interactive 3D scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and robotics, particularly due to persistent object occlusions and limited sensor coverage. Multiview observations from a single scene scan often fail to capture the full structural details. Existing approaches typically rely on multi stage pipelines, such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting or require per-object dense scanning, both of which are error-prone, and not easily scalable. We propose IGFuse, a novel framework that reconstructs interactive Gaussian scene by fusing observations from multiple scans, where natural object rearrangement between captures reveal previously occluded regions. Our method constructs segmentation aware Gaussian fields and enforces bi-directional photometric and semantic consistency across scans. To handle spatial misalignments, we introduce a pseudo-intermediate scene state for unified alignment, alongside collaborative co-pruning strategies to refine geometry. IGFuse enables high fidelity rendering and object level scene manipulation without dense observations or complex pipelines. Extensive experiments validate the framework's strong generalization to novel scene configurations, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world 3D reconstruction and real-to-simulation transfer. Our project page is available online.

arXiv:2508.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 4DNeX, the first feed-forward framework for generating 4D (i.e., dynamic 3D) scene representations from a single image. In contrast to existing methods that rely on computationally intensive optimization or require multi-frame video inputs, 4DNeX enables efficient, end-to-end image-to-4D generation by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model. Specifically, 1) to alleviate the scarcity of 4D data, we construct 4DNeX-10M, a large-scale dataset with high-quality 4D annotations generated using advanced reconstruction approaches. 2) we introduce a unified 6D video representation that jointly models RGB and XYZ sequences, facilitating structured learning of both appearance and geometry. 3) we propose a set of simple yet effective adaptation strategies to repurpose pretrained video diffusion models for 4D modeling. 4DNeX produces high-quality dynamic point clouds that enable novel-view video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DNeX outperforms existing 4D generation methods in efficiency and generalizability, offering a scalable solution for image-to-4D modeling and laying the foundation for generative 4D world models that simulate dynamic scene evolution.

Abstract: Data-driven radio frequency (RF) tomography has demonstrated significant potential for underground target detection, due to the penetrative nature of RF signals through soil. However, it is still challenging to achieve accurate and robust performance in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a data-driven radio frequency tomography (DRIFT) framework with the following key components to reconstruct cross section images of underground root tubers, even with significant changes in RF signals. First, we design a cross-modal sensing system with RF and visual sensors, and propose to train an RF tomography deep neural network (DNN) model following the cross-modal learning approach. Then we propose to apply continual learning to automatically update the DNN model, once environment changes are detected in a dynamic environment. Experimental results show that our approach achieves an average equivalent diameter error of 2.29 cm, 23.2% improvement upon the state-of-the-art approach. Our DRIFT code and dataset are publicly available on https://github.com/Data-driven-RTI/DRIFT.

<title>Contrastive Regularization over LoRA for Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning (MBIIL) is essential for handling diverse tasks and modalities in the biomedical domain, as training separate models for each modality or task significantly increases inference costs. Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a single modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally across modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve previously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively leverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities? To address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality knowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language model (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental learning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality and the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA). Specifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining computational efficiency. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VentusAislant/MSLoRA_CR.

Abstract: Remote user verification in Internet-based applications is becoming increasingly important nowadays. A popular scenario for it consists of submitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service platform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the requested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an individual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable. However, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can surpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and synthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an ever-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable from authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are faced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train fake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is originated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept private by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government, police, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and discuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection research. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over 900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using different smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In addition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite. 3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We release a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic attacks from popular databases in the literature.

Abstract: Arthropods, including pollinators, respond to environmental electrical fields. Here, we show that electric field information can be decoded to reconstruct environmental features. We develop an algorithm capable of inferring the shapes of polarisable flowers from the electric field generated by a nearby charged bee. We simulated electric fields arising from bee flower interactions for flowers with varying petal geometries. These simulated data were used to train a deep learning UNet model to recreate petal shapes. The model accurately reconstructed diverse flower shapes including more complex flower shapes not included in training. Reconstruction performance peaked at an optimal bee flower distance, indicating distance-dependent encoding of shape information. These findings show that electroreception can impart rich spatial detail, offering insights into arthropod environmental perception.

Abstract: Rural healthcare faces persistent challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, workforce shortages, and socioeconomic disparities that hinder access to essential services. This study investigates the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing these issues in underserved rural areas. We systematically reviewed 109 studies published between 2019 and 2024 from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus. Articles were screened using PRISMA guidelines and Covidence software. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify key patterns and insights regarding AI implementation in rural healthcare delivery. The findings reveal significant promise for AI applications, such as predictive analytics, telemedicine platforms, and automated diagnostic tools, in improving healthcare accessibility, quality, and efficiency. Among these, advanced AI systems, including Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), offer particularly transformative potential. MFMs integrate diverse data sources, such as imaging, clinical records, and bio signals, to support comprehensive decision-making, while LLMs facilitate clinical documentation, patient triage, translation, and virtual assistance. Together, these technologies can revolutionize rural healthcare by augmenting human capacity, reducing diagnostic delays, and democratizing access to expertise. However, barriers remain, including infrastructural limitations, data quality concerns, and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration, investment in digital infrastructure, and the development of regulatory frameworks. This review offers actionable recommendations and highlights areas for future research to ensure equitable and sustainable integration of AI in rural healthcare systems.

Abstract: High-quality labeled geospatial datasets are essential for extracting insights and understanding our planet. Unfortunately, these datasets often do not span the entire globe and are limited to certain geographic regions where data was collected. Google DeepMind's recently released AlphaEarth Foundations (AEF) provides an information-dense global geospatial representation designed to serve as a useful input across a wide gamut of tasks. In this article we propose and evaluate a methodology which leverages AEF to extend geospatial labeled datasets beyond their initial geographic regions. We show that even basic models like random forests or logistic regression can be used to accomplish this task. We investigate a case study of extending LANDFIRE's Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) dataset beyond the USA into Canada at two levels of granularity: EvtPhys (13 classes) and EvtGp (80 classes). Qualitatively, for EvtPhys, model predictions align with ground truth. Trained models achieve 81% and 73% classification accuracy on EvtPhys validation sets in the USA and Canada, despite discussed limitations.

Abstract: Recent developments in computer vision have enabled the availability of segmented images across various domains, such as medicine, where segmented radiography images play an important role in diagnosis-making. As prediction problems are common in medical image analysis, this work explores the use of segmented images (through the associated contours they highlight) as predictors in a supervised classification context. Consequently, we develop a new approach for image analysis that takes into account the shape of objects within images. For this aim, we introduce a new formalism that extends the study of single random planar curves to the joint analysis of multiple planar curves-referred to here as multivariate planar curves. In this framework, we propose a solution to the alignment issue in statistical shape analysis. The obtained multivariate shape variables are then used in functional classification methods through tangent projections. Detection of cardiomegaly in segmented X-rays and numerical experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the appeal and robustness of the proposed method.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of machine learning technologies in autonomous driving systems, their role in addressing complex environmental perception challenges has become increasingly crucial. However, existing machine learning models exhibit significant vulnerability, as their performance critically depends on the fundamental assumption that training and testing data satisfy the independent and identically distributed condition, which is difficult to guarantee in real-world applications. Dynamic variations in data distribution caused by seasonal changes, weather fluctuations lead to data shift problems in autonomous driving systems. This study investigates the data shift problem in autonomous driving object detection tasks, systematically analyzing its complexity and diverse manifestations. We conduct a comprehensive review of data shift detection methods and employ shift detection analysis techniques to perform dataset categorization and balancing. Building upon this foundation, we construct an object detection model. To validate our approach, we optimize the model by integrating CycleGAN-based data augmentation techniques with the YOLOv5 framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to baseline models on the BDD100K dataset.

Abstract: Efficient modeling of long sequences of high-order data requires a more efficient architecture than Transformer. In this paper, we investigate two key aspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally designed for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning strategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that scanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield promising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of attention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is efficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid architecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses global information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict local modeling. Together, they form a simple framework that offers a promising and practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling.

Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Skin diseases impose a substantial burden on global healthcare systems, driven by their high prevalence (affecting up to 70% of the population), complex diagnostic processes, and a critical shortage of dermatologists in resource-limited areas. While artificial intelligence(AI) tools have demonstrated promise in dermatological image analysis, current models face limitations-they often rely on large, manually labeled datasets and are built for narrow, specific tasks, making them less effective in real-world settings. To tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model for dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three sources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections), DermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the self-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and knowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only deepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also substantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical tasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level clinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity grading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion segmentation. Furthermore, DermNIO demonstrates strong robustness in privacy-preserving federated learning scenarios and across diverse skin types and sexes. In a blinded reader study with 23 dermatologists, DermNIO achieved 95.79% diagnostic accuracy (versus clinicians' 73.66%), and AI assistance improved clinician performance by 17.21%.

Abstract: The Apple Vision Pro is equipped with accurate eye-tracking capabilities, yet the privacy restrictions on the device prevent direct access to continuous user gaze data. This study introduces iTrace, a novel application that overcomes these limitations through click-based gaze extraction techniques, including manual methods like a pinch gesture, and automatic approaches utilizing dwell control or a gaming controller. We developed a system with a client-server architecture that captures the gaze coordinates and transforms them into dynamic heatmaps for video and spatial eye tracking. The system can generate individual and averaged heatmaps, enabling analysis of personal and collective attention patterns.
  To demonstrate its effectiveness and evaluate the usability and performance, a study was conducted with two groups of 10 participants, each testing different clicking methods. The 8BitDo controller achieved higher average data collection rates at 14.22 clicks/s compared to 0.45 clicks/s with dwell control, enabling significantly denser heatmap visualizations. The resulting heatmaps reveal distinct attention patterns, including concentrated focus in lecture videos and broader scanning during problem-solving tasks. By allowing dynamic attention visualization while maintaining a high gaze precision of 91 %, iTrace demonstrates strong potential for a wide range of applications in educational content engagement, environmental design evaluation, marketing analysis, and clinical cognitive assessment. Despite the current gaze data restrictions on the Apple Vision Pro, we encourage developers to use iTrace only in research settings.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning has achieved impressive results but remains limited by its reliance on large labeled datasets, poor generalization to unseen scenarios, and growing computational demands. In contrast, classical optimization methods are data-efficient and lightweight but often suffer from slow convergence. While learned optimizers offer a promising fusion of both worlds, most focus on first-order methods, leaving learned second-order approaches largely unexplored.
  We propose a novel learned second-order optimizer that introduces a trainable preconditioning unit to enhance the classical Symmetric-Rank-One (SR1) algorithm. This unit generates data-driven vectors used to construct positive semi-definite rank-one matrices, aligned with the secant constraint via a learned projection. Our method is evaluated through analytic experiments and on the real-world task of Monocular Human Mesh Recovery (HMR), where it outperforms existing learned optimization-based approaches. Featuring a lightweight model and requiring no annotated data or fine-tuning, our approach offers strong generalization and is well-suited for integration into broader optimization-based frameworks.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression generation from natural language is a crucial task in Computer Graphics, with applications in Animation, Virtual Avatars, and Human-Computer Interaction. However, current generative models suffer from datasets that are either speech-driven or limited to coarse emotion labels, lacking the nuanced, expressive descriptions needed for fine-grained control, and were captured using elaborate and expensive equipment. We hence present a new dataset of facial motion sequences featuring nuanced performances and semantic annotation. The data is easily collected using commodity equipment and LLM-generated natural language instructions, in the popular ARKit blendshape format. This provides riggable motion, rich with expressive performances and labels. We accordingly train two baseline models, and evaluate their performance for future benchmarking. Using our Express4D dataset, the trained models can learn meaningful text-to-expression motion generation and capture the many-to-many mapping of the two modalities. The dataset, code, and video examples are available on our webpage: https://jaron1990.github.io/Express4D/

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial and challenging technique for aligning anatomical structures in medical images and is widely applied in diverse clinical applications. However, existing approaches often struggle to capture fine-grained local deformations and large-scale global deformations simultaneously within a unified framework. We present FractMorph, a novel 3D dual-parallel transformer-based architecture that enhances cross-image feature matching through multi-domain fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) branches. Each Fractional Cross-Attention (FCA) block applies parallel FrFTs at fractional angles of 0{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 90{\deg}, along with a log-magnitude branch, to effectively extract local, semi-global, and global features at the same time. These features are fused via cross-attention between the fixed and moving image streams. A lightweight U-Net style network then predicts a dense deformation field from the transformer-enriched features. On the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset, FractMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.45%, an average per-structure DSC of 75.15%, and a 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) of 1.54 mm on our data split. We also introduce FractMorph-Light, a lightweight variant of our model with only 29.6M parameters, which maintains the superior accuracy of the main model while using approximately half the memory. Our results demonstrate that multi-domain spectral-spatial attention in transformers can robustly and efficiently model complex non-rigid deformations in medical images using a single end-to-end network, without the need for scenario-specific tuning or hierarchical multi-scale networks. The source code of our implementation is available at https://github.com/shayankebriti/FractMorph.

Abstract: The core mechanical system is built around three stepper motors for physical manipulation, a microcontroller for hardware control, a camera and YOLO detection model for real-time cube state detection. A significant software component is the development of a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) designed in Unity.

Abstract: Accurate thalamic nuclei segmentation is crucial for understanding neurological diseases, brain functions, and guiding clinical interventions. However, the optimal inputs for segmentation remain unclear. This study systematically evaluates multiple MRI contrasts, including MPRAGE and FGATIR sequences, quantitative PD and T1 maps, and multiple T1-weighted images at different inversion times (multi-TI), to determine the most effective inputs. For multi-TI images, we employ a gradient-based saliency analysis with Monte Carlo dropout and propose an Overall Importance Score to select the images contributing most to segmentation. A 3D U-Net is trained on each of these configurations. Results show that T1 maps alone achieve strong quantitative performance and superior qualitative outcomes, while PD maps offer no added value. These findings underscore the value of T1 maps as a reliable and efficient input among the evaluated options, providing valuable guidance for optimizing imaging protocols when thalamic structures are of clinical or research interest.

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs), one of the most widely used generative models, are known to suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon that reduces the diversity of generated samples. To avoid posterior collapse, many prior works have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the trade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For this reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent identifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they require structural constraints on the network architecture. For further clarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of individual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint. Then, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by mathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control posterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture. We experimentally evaluate our approach, which controls posterior collapse on varied datasets such as MNIST, fashionMNIST, Omniglot, CelebA, and FFHQ.

Abstract: We introduce PROD (Palpative Reconstruction of Deformables), a novel method for reconstructing the shape and mechanical properties of deformable objects using elastostatic signed distance functions (SDFs). Unlike traditional approaches that rely on purely geometric or visual data, PROD integrates palpative interaction -- measured through force-controlled surface probing -- to estimate both the static and dynamic response of soft materials. We model the deformation of an object as an elastostatic process and derive a governing Poisson equation for estimating its SDF from a sparse set of pose and force measurements. By incorporating steady-state elastodynamic assumptions, we show that the undeformed SDF can be recovered from deformed observations with provable convergence. Our approach also enables the estimation of material stiffness by analyzing displacement responses to varying force inputs. We demonstrate the robustness of PROD in handling pose errors, non-normal force application, and curvature errors in simulated soft body interactions. These capabilities make PROD a powerful tool for reconstructing deformable objects in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to medical imaging and haptic feedback systems.

Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of pulmonary nodules on chest X-rays can differentiate between life-saving early treatment and avoidable invasive procedures. Calcification is a definitive indicator of benign nodules and is the primary foundation for diagnosis. In actual practice, diagnosing pulmonary nodule calcification on chest X-rays predominantly depends on the physician's visual assessment, resulting in significant diversity in interpretation. Furthermore, overlapping anatomical elements, such as ribs and spine, complicate the precise identification of calcification patterns. This study presents a calcification classification model that attains strong diagnostic performance by utilizing fused features derived from raw images and their structure-suppressed variants to reduce structural interference. We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images (151 calcified nodules and 550 non-calcified nodules), all obtained from Ajou University Hospital. The suggested model attained an accuracy of 86.52% and an AUC of 0.8889 in calcification diagnosis, surpassing the model trained on raw images by 3.54% and 0.0385, respectively.

<title>Temporal and Rotational Calibration for Event-Centric Multi-Sensor Systems</title>

Abstract: Event cameras generate asynchronous signals in response to pixel-level brightness changes, offering a sensing paradigm with theoretically microsecond-scale latency that can significantly enhance the performance of multi-sensor systems. Extrinsic calibration is a critical prerequisite for effective sensor fusion; however, the configuration that involves event cameras remains an understudied topic. In this paper, we propose a motion-based temporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric multi-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets. Our method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event cameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from conventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method efficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are derived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration pipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset and rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and rotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a continuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both publicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed method achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while exhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting its precision, robustness and flexibility. To facilitate future research, our implementation will be made open-source. Code: https://github.com/NAIL-HNU/EvMultiCalib.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages for edge robotics applications due to their asynchronous operation and sparse, event-driven output, making them well-suited for tasks requiring fast and efficient closed-loop control, such as gesture-based human-robot interaction. Despite this potential, existing event processing solutions remain limited, often lacking complete end-to-end implementations, exhibiting high latency, and insufficiently exploiting event data sparsity. In this paper, we present HOMI, an ultra-low latency, end-to-end edge AI platform comprising a Prophesee IMX636 event sensor chip with an Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+MPSoC FPGA chip, deploying an in-house developed AI accelerator. We have developed hardware-optimized pre-processing pipelines supporting both constant-time and constant-event modes for histogram accumulation, linear and exponential time surfaces. Our general-purpose implementation caters to both accuracy-driven and low-latency applications. HOMI achieves 94% accuracy on the DVS Gesture dataset as a use case when configured for high accuracy operation and provides a throughput of 1000 fps for low-latency configuration. The hardware-optimised pipeline maintains a compact memory footprint and utilises only 33% of the available LUT resources on the FPGA, leaving ample headroom for further latency reduction, model parallelisation, multi-task deployments, or integration of more complex architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex multimodal tasks. While MLLMs excel at visual perception and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates. Our benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation. However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles generate vast amounts of sensor data daily, raising significant privacy and communication challenges for centralized machine learning approaches in perception tasks. This study presents a decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions, and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs (8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: There is a tradeoff between attaining statistical power with large, difficult to gather data sets, and producing highly scalable assays that register brief data samples. Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines.

Abstract: Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation (MERG) is crucial for building emotionally intelligent human-computer interactions. Although large language models (LLMs) have improved text-based ERG, challenges remain in handling multimodal emotional content and maintaining identity consistency. Thus, we propose E3RG, an Explicit Emotion-driven Empathetic Response Generation System based on multimodal LLMs which decomposes MERG task into three parts: multimodal empathy understanding, empathy memory retrieval, and multimodal response generation. By integrating advanced expressive speech and video generative models, E3RG delivers natural, emotionally rich, and identity-consistent responses without extra training. Experiments validate the superiority of our system on both zero-shot and few-shot settings, securing Top-1 position in the Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge on ACM MM 25.

Abstract: Single-photon sensing has generated great interest as a prominent technique of long-distance and ultra-sensitive imaging, however, it tends to yield sparse and spatially biased point clouds, thus limiting its practical utility. In this work, we propose using point upsampling networks to increase point density and reduce spatial distortion in single-photon point cloud. Particularly, our network is built on the state space model which integrates a multi-path scanning mechanism to enrich spatial context, a bidirectional Mamba backbone to capture global geometry and local details, and an adaptive upsample shift module to correct offset-induced distortions. Extensive experiments are implemented on commonly-used datasets to confirm its high reconstruction accuracy and strong robustness to the distortion noise, and also on real-world data to demonstrate that our model is able to generate visually consistent, detail-preserving, and noise suppressed point clouds. Our work is the first to establish the upsampling framework for single-photon sensing, and hence opens a new avenue for single-photon sensing and its practical applications in the downstreaming tasks.

Abstract: Urban greenery is often linked to better health, yet findings from past research have been inconsistent. One reason is that official greenery metrics measure the amount or nearness of greenery but ignore how often people actually may potentially see or use it in daily life. To address this gap, we introduced a new classification that separates on-road greenery, which people see while walking through streets, from off-road greenery, which requires planned visits. We did so by combining aerial imagery of Greater London and greenery data from OpenStreetMap with quantified greenery from over 100,000 Google Street View images and accessibility estimates based on 160,000 road segments. We linked these measures to 7.45 billion medical prescriptions issued by the National Health Service and processed through our methodology. These prescriptions cover five conditions: diabetes, hypertension, asthma, depression, and anxiety, as well as opioid use. As hypothesized, we found that green on-road was more strongly linked to better health than four widely used official measures. For example, hypertension prescriptions dropped by 3.68% in wards with on-road greenery above the median citywide level compared to those below it. If all below-median wards reached the citywide median in on-road greenery, prescription costs could fall by up to {\pounds}3.15 million each year. These results suggest that greenery seen in daily life may be more relevant than public yet secluded greenery, and that official metrics commonly used in the literature have important limitations.

Abstract: This work proposes XR-NPE, a high-throughput Mixed-precision SIMD Neural Processing Engine, designed for extended reality (XR) perception workloads like visual inertial odometry (VIO), object classification, and eye gaze extraction. XR-NPE is first to support FP4, Posit (4,1), Posit (8,0), and Posit (16,1) formats, with layer adaptive hybrid-algorithmic implementation supporting ultra-low bit precision to significantly reduce memory bandwidth requirements, and accompanied by quantization-aware training for minimal accuracy loss. The proposed Reconfigurable Mantissa Multiplication and Exponent processing Circuitry (RMMEC) reduces dark silicon in the SIMD MAC compute engine, assisted by selective power gating to reduce energy consumption, providing 2.85x improved arithmetic intensity. XR-NPE achieves a maximum operating frequency of 1.72 GHz, area 0.016 mm2 , and arithmetic intensity 14 pJ at CMOS 28nm, reducing 42% area, 38% power compared to the best of state-of-the-art MAC approaches. The proposed XR-NPE based AXI-enabled Matrix-multiplication co-processor consumes 1.4x fewer LUTs, 1.77x fewer FFs, and provides 1.2x better energy efficiency compared to SoTA accelerators on VCU129. The proposed co-processor provides 23% better energy efficiency and 4% better compute density for VIO workloads. XR-NPE establishes itself as a scalable, precision-adaptive compute engine for future resource-constrained XR devices. The complete set for codes for results reproducibility are released publicly, enabling designers and researchers to readily adopt and build upon them. https://github.com/mukullokhande99/XR-NPE.

<title>Grounding Actions in Camera Space: Observation-Centric Vision-Language-Action Policy</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13103</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models frequently encounter challenges in generalizing to real-world environments due to inherent discrepancies between observation and action spaces. Although training data are collected from diverse camera perspectives, the models typically predict end-effector poses within the robot base coordinate frame, resulting in spatial inconsistencies. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce the Observation-Centric VLA (OC-VLA) framework, which grounds action predictions directly in the camera observation space. Leveraging the camera's extrinsic calibration matrix, OC-VLA transforms end-effector poses from the robot base coordinate system into the camera coordinate system, thereby unifying prediction targets across heterogeneous viewpoints. This lightweight, plug-and-play strategy ensures robust alignment between perception and action, substantially improving model resilience to camera viewpoint variations. The proposed approach is readily compatible with existing VLA architectures, requiring no substantial modifications. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that OC-VLA accelerates convergence, enhances task success rates, and improves cross-view generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: We propose a novel Transformer-based image-to-text generation model termed as \textbf{ACF} that adaptively clusters vision patches into object regions and language words into phrases to implicitly learn object-phrase alignments for better visual-text coherence. To achieve this, we design a novel self-attention layer that applies self-attention over the elements in a local cluster window instead of the whole sequence. The window size is softly decided by a clustering matrix that is calculated by the current input data and thus this process is adaptive. By stacking these revised self-attention layers to construct ACF, the small clusters in the lower layers can be grouped into a bigger cluster, \eg vision/language. ACF clusters small objects/phrases into bigger ones. In this gradual clustering process, a parsing tree is generated which embeds the hierarchical knowledge of the input sequence. As a result, by using ACF to build the vision encoder and language decoder, the hierarchical object-phrase alignments are embedded and then transferred from vision to language domains in two popular image-to-text tasks: Image captioning and Visual Question Answering. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACF, which outperforms most SOTA captioning and VQA models and achieves comparable scores compared with some large-scale pre-trained models. Our code is available \href{https://github.com/ZihuaEvan/ACFModel/}{[here]}.

Abstract: Accurate teeth segmentation and orientation are fundamental in modern oral healthcare, enabling precise diagnosis, treatment planning, and dental implant design. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach to teeth segmentation and orientation from panoramic X-ray images, leveraging deep-learning techniques. We built an end-to-end instance segmentation network that uses an encoder-decoder architecture reinforced with grid-aware attention gates along the skip connections. We introduce oriented bounding box (OBB) generation through principal component analysis (PCA) for precise tooth orientation estimation. Evaluating our approach on the publicly available DNS dataset, comprising 543 panoramic X-ray images, we achieve the highest Intersection-over-Union (IoU) score of 82.43% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score of 90.37% among compared models in teeth instance segmentation. In OBB analysis, we obtain a Rotated IoU (RIoU) score of 82.82%. We also conduct detailed analyses of individual tooth labels and categorical performance, shedding light on strengths and weaknesses. The proposed model's accuracy and versatility offer promising prospects for improving dental diagnoses, treatment planning, and personalized healthcare in the oral domain. Our generated OBB coordinates and code are available at https://github.com/mrinal054/Instance/teeth/segmentation.

<title>GeoSAM: Fine-tuning SAM with Multi-Modal Prompts for Mobility Infrastructure Segmentation</title>

Abstract: In geographical image segmentation, performance is often constrained by the limited availability of training data and a lack of generalizability, particularly for segmenting mobility infrastructure such as roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks. Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on millions of natural images, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot segmentation performance, providing a potential solution. However, SAM struggles with geographical images, such as aerial and satellite imagery, due to its training being confined to natural images and the narrow features and textures of these objects blending into their surroundings. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a SAM-based framework that fine-tunes SAM using automatically generated multi-modal prompts. Specifically, GeoSAM integrates point prompts from a pre-trained task-specific model as primary visual guidance, and text prompts generated by a large language model as secondary semantic guidance, enabling the model to better capture both spatial structure and contextual meaning. GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for mobility infrastructure segmentation in both familiar and completely unseen regions by at least 5\% in mIoU, representing a significant leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure, including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images.

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-based person retrieval seeks to retrieve images of a target person using textual descriptions, without relying on identity annotations and is more challenging and practical. The primary challenge is the intra-class differences, encompassing intra-modal feature variations and cross-modal semantic gaps. Prior works have focused on instance-level samples and ignored prototypical features of each person which are intrinsic and invariant. Toward this, we propose a Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning (CPCL) method. In practice, the CPCL introduces the CLIP model to weakly supervised text-based person retrieval to map visual and textual instances into a shared latent space. Subsequently, the proposed Prototypical Multi-modal Memory (PMM) module captures associations between heterogeneous modalities of image-text pairs belonging to the same person through the Hybrid Cross-modal Matching (HCM) module in a many-to-many mapping fashion. Moreover, the Outlier Pseudo Label Mining (OPLM) module further distinguishes valuable outlier samples from each modality, enhancing the creation of more reliable clusters by mining implicit relationships between image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks of weakly supervised text-based person retrieval, which validate the effectiveness, generalizability of CPCL.

<title>A locally statistical active contour model for SAR image segmentation can be solved by denoising algorithms</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel locally statistical variational active contour model based on I-divergence-TV denoising model, which hybrides geodesic active contour (GAC) model with active contours without edges (ACWE) model, and can be used to segment images corrupted by multiplicative gamma noise. By adding a diffusion term into the level set evolution (LSE) equation of the proposed model, we construct a reaction-diffusion (RD) equation, which can gradually regularize the level set function (LSF) to be piecewise constant in each segment domain and gain the stable solution. We further transform the proposed model into classic ROF model by adding a proximity term. [27] is submitted on 29-Aug-2013, and our early edition ever submitted to TGRS on 12-Jun-2012, Venkatakrishnan et al. [31] proposed their 'pnp algorithm' on 29-May-2013, so Venkatakrishnan and we proposed the 'pnp algorithm' almost simultaneously. Inspired by a fast denoising algorithm proposed by Jia-Zhao recently, we propose two fast fixed point algorithms to solve SAR image segmentation question. Experimental results for real SAR images show that the proposed image segmentation model can efficiently stop the contours at weak or blurred edges, and can automatically detect the exterior and interior boundaries of images with multiplicative gamma noise. The proposed FPRD1/FPRD2 models are about 1/2 (or less than) of the time required for the SBRD model based on the Split Bregman technique.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is an effective but labor-intensive way to control text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Its time-intensive nature and complexity have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, play a foundational role in various cross-modal applications. To fully leverage VLMs' potential in adapting to downstream tasks, context optimization methods like Prompt Tuning are essential. However, one key limitation is the lack of diversity in prompt templates, whether they are hand-crafted or learned through additional modules. This limitation restricts the capabilities of pretrained VLMs and can result in incorrect predictions in downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we propose Context Optimization with Multi-Knowledge Representation (CoKnow), a framework that enhances Prompt Learning for VLMs with rich contextual knowledge. To facilitate CoKnow during inference, we trained lightweight semantic knowledge mappers, which are capable of generating Multi-Knowledge Representation for an input image without requiring additional priors. Experimentally, We conducted extensive experiments on 11 publicly available datasets, demonstrating that CoKnow outperforms a series of previous methods.

Abstract: In robotics and computer vision, semantic mapping remains a critical challenge for machines to comprehend complex environments. Traditional panoptic mapping approaches are constrained by fixed labels, limiting their ability to handle novel objects. We present Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM), which leverages foundation models for dynamic labeling without additional training. UPPM is evaluated across three comprehensive levels: Segmentation-to-Map, Map-to-Map, and Segmentation-to-Segmentation. Results demonstrate UPPM attains exceptional geometry reconstruction accuracy (0.61cm on the Flat dataset), the highest panoptic quality (0.414), and better performance compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the contributions of unified semantics, custom NMS, and blurry frame filtering, with the custom NMS improving the completion ratio by 8.27% on the Flat dataset. UPPM demonstrates effective scene reconstruction with rich semantic labeling across diverse datasets.

Abstract: As the burden of herbicide resistance grows and the environmental costs of excessive herbicide use become clear, new approaches to managing weed populations are needed. This is particularly true for cereal crops, like wheat and barley, that are staple foods and occupy a globally significant share of farmland. Even modest advances in weed management practices across these crops could deliver major benefits for both the environment and food security. Blackgrass is a major grass weed which causes particular problems in cereal crops in north-west Europe, a major cereal production area, because it has high levels of herbicide resistance. Detecting blackgrass is also difficult due to its similarity to cereals. Yet, a systematic review of the literature on weed recognition in wheat and barley, included in this study, highlights that blackgrass - and grass weeds more broadly - have received less research attention compared to certain broadleaf weeds. With the use of machine vision and multispectral imaging, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods to identify blackgrass in wheat and barley crops. As part of this work, we present the Eastern England Blackgrass Dataset, a large dataset with which we evaluate several key aspects of blackgrass weed recognition. Firstly, we determine the performance of different CNN and transformer-based architectures on images from unseen fields. Secondly, we demonstrate the role that different spectral bands have on the performance of weed classification. Lastly, we evaluate the role of dataset size in classification performance for each of the models trialled. All models tested achieved an accuracy greater than 80%. Our best model achieved 89.6% and that only half the training data was required to achieve this performance. Our dataset is available at: https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/research/data-sets-software/eastern-england-blackgrass-dataset .

Abstract: Continuous Conditional Generative Modeling (CCGM) estimates high-dimensional data distributions, such as images, conditioned on scalar continuous variables (aka regression labels). While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UBCDingXin/CCDM.

Abstract: Transformer architectures rely on position encodings to model the spatial structure of input data. Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) is a widely used method in language models that encodes relative positions through fixed, block-diagonal, rotation matrices applied to key-query interactions. We hypothesize that this inductive bias limits their RoPE's effectiveness for modalities with high dimensional structure. Lie Relative Encodings (LieRE) introduce a principled generalization of RoPE, aimed at increasing the representational capacity of positional encodings in transformers. Instead of fixed 2D rotations, LieRE learns dense skew-symmetric matrices (Lie algebra elements), which are then differentiable mapped to form high-dimensional rotation matrices (Lie group elements). This results in richer, learnable, and continuous, encodings of both relative and absolute positional information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LieRE on 2D and 3D vision tasks, showing that it generalizes well to higher input resolutions while maintaining computational efficiency. The code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/LieRE.

Abstract: Cancer diagnosis has greatly benefited from the integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with multiple instance learning (MIL), enabling high-resolution analysis of tissue morphology. Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challenging due to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hinder contextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired from conventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving contextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

Abstract: Road safety assessments are critical yet costly, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where most roads remain unrated. Traditional methods require expert annotation and training data, while supervised learning-based approaches struggle to generalise across regions. In this paper, we introduce \textit{V-RoAst}, a zero-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) framework using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to classify road safety attributes defined by the iRAP standard. We introduce the first open-source dataset from ThaiRAP, consisting of over 2,000 curated street-level images from Thailand annotated for this task. We evaluate Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini on this dataset and benchmark their performance against VGGNet and ResNet baselines. While VLMs underperform on spatial awareness, they generalise well to unseen classes and offer flexible prompt-based reasoning without retraining. Our results show that VLMs can serve as automatic road assessment tools when integrated with complementary data. This work is the first to explore VLMs for zero-shot infrastructure risk assessment and opens new directions for automatic, low-cost road safety mapping.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in the video comprehension field. Despite remarkable content reasoning and instruction following capabilities they demonstrated, the hallucination problem of these VideoLLMs is less explored compared with its counterpart in the image domain. To mitigate this gap, we propose EventHallusion, a novel benchmark that focuses on assessing the VideoLLMs' hallucination toward event, the crux of video analysis. From a hallucination attribution perspective, our EventHallusion benchmark is curated to assess a VideoLLM's susceptibility toward language priors and vision-language biases. On the other hand, we also propose a simple yet effective method, called Temporal Contrastive Decoding (TCD), to tackle the hallucination problems of VideoLLMs. The proposed TCD method rectifies the model's bias toward its priors during the decoding stage by comparing the original video with a modified version, in which temporal cues are disrupted. Through comprehensive evaluation of eight open-source and two closed-source VideoLLMs on the proposed EventHallusion benchmark, we observe that the open-source models suffer significantly from hallucination problems, whereas the closed-source ones perform markedly better. By further equipping open-source VideoLLMs with the proposed TCD approach, evident performance improvements are achieved across most metrics in the EventHallusion benchmark. Our codes and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/Stevetich/EventHallusion.

Abstract: In this work, we explore using the style ambiguity training objective, originally used to approximate creativity, on a diffusion model. However, this objective requires the use of a pretrained classifier and a labeled dataset. We introduce new forms of style ambiguity loss that do not require training a new classifier or a labeled dataset. Instead of using a classifier, we generate centroids in the CLIP embedding space, and images are classified based on their relative distance to said centroids. We find the centroids via K-means clustering of an unlabeled dataset, as well as using text labels to generate CLIP embeddings, to be used as centroids.

Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of deep learning across multiple domains, the inherent opacity of these models has driven the development of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Among these efforts, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a key approach to improve interpretability by leveraging high-level semantic information. However, CBMs, like other machine learning models, are susceptible to security threats, particularly backdoor attacks, which can covertly manipulate model behaviors. Understanding that the community has not yet studied the concept level backdoor attack of CBM, because of "Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.", we introduce CAT (Concept-level Backdoor ATtacks), a methodology that leverages the conceptual representations within CBMs to embed triggers during training, enabling controlled manipulation of model predictions at inference time. An enhanced attack pattern, CAT+, incorporates a correlation function to systematically select the most effective and stealthy concept triggers, thereby optimizing the attack's impact. Our comprehensive evaluation framework assesses both the attack success rate and stealthiness, demonstrating that CAT and CAT+ maintain high performance on clean data while achieving significant targeted effects on backdoored datasets. This work underscores the potential security risks associated with CBMs and provides a robust testing methodology for future security assessments.

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), repetitive motor behaviors such as spinning, head banging, and arm flapping are key indicators for diagnosis. This study focuses on distinguishing between children with ASD and typically developed (TD) peers by analyzing videos captured in natural, uncontrolled environments. Using the publicly available Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD), we address the classification task as a binary problem, ASD vs. TD, based on stereotypical repetitive gestures. We adopt a pipeline integrating YOLOv7-based detection, extensive video augmentations, and the VideoMAE framework, which efficiently captures both spatial and temporal features through a high-ratio masking and reconstruction strategy. Our proposed approach achieves 95% accuracy, 0.93 precision, 0.94 recall, and 0.94 F1 score, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining advanced object detection, robust data augmentation, and masked autoencoder-based video modeling for reliable ASD vs. TD classification in naturalistic settings.

Abstract: We propose Quadratic Gaussian Splatting (QGS), a novel representation that replaces static primitives with deformable quadric surfaces (e.g., ellipse, paraboloids) to capture intricate geometry. Unlike prior works that rely on Euclidean distance for primitive density modeling--a metric misaligned with surface geometry under deformation--QGS introduces geodesic distance-based density distributions. This innovation ensures that density weights adapt intrinsically to the primitive curvature, preserving consistency during shape changes (e.g., from planar disks to curved paraboloids). By solving geodesic distances in closed form on quadric surfaces, QGS enables surface-aware splatting, where a single primitive can represent complex curvature that previously required dozens of planar surfels, potentially reducing memory usage while maintaining efficient rendering via fast ray-quadric intersection. Experiments on DTU, Tanks and Temples, and MipNeRF360 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art surface reconstruction, with QGS reducing geometric error (chamfer distance) by 33% over 2DGS and 27% over GOF on the DTU dataset. Crucially, QGS retains competitive appearance quality, bridging the gap between geometric precision and visual fidelity for applications like robotics and immersive reality.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&amp;A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&amp;As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench

Abstract: 3D semantic field learning is crucial for applications like autonomous navigation, AR/VR, and robotics, where accurate comprehension of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints is essential. Existing methods struggle under sparse view conditions, relying on inefficient per-scene multi-view optimizations, which are impractical for many real-world tasks. To address this, we propose SLGaussian, a feed-forward method for constructing 3D semantic fields from sparse viewpoints, allowing direct inference of 3DGS-based scenes. By ensuring consistent SAM segmentations through video tracking and using low-dimensional indexing for high-dimensional CLIP features, SLGaussian efficiently embeds language information in 3D space, offering a robust solution for accurate 3D scene understanding under sparse view conditions. In experiments on two-view sparse 3D object querying and segmentation in the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets, SLGaussian outperforms existing methods in chosen IoU, Localization Accuracy, and mIoU. Moreover, our model achieves scene inference in under 30 seconds and open-vocabulary querying in just 0.011 seconds per query.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training while preserving data privacy, yet existing FL benchmarks address relatively simple classification tasks, where each sample is annotated with a one-hot label. However, little attention has been paid to demonstrating an FL benchmark that handles complicated semantics, where each sample encompasses diverse semantic information, such as relations between objects. Because the existing benchmarks are designed to distribute data in a narrow view of a single semantic, managing the complicated \textit{semantic heterogeneity} across clients when formalizing FL benchmarks is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a benchmark process to establish an FL benchmark with controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients: two key steps are (i) data clustering with semantics and (ii) data distributing via controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients. As a proof of concept, we construct a federated PSG benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of the existing PSG methods in an FL setting with controllable semantic heterogeneity of scene graphs. We also present the effectiveness of our benchmark by applying robust federated learning algorithms to data heterogeneity to show increased performance. To our knowledge, this is the first benchmark framework that enables federated learning and its evaluation for multi-semantic vision tasks under the controlled semantic heterogeneity. Our code is available at \textit{https://github.com/Seung-B/FL-PSG}.

Abstract: Automated assessment of surgical skills using artificial intelligence (AI) provides trainees with instantaneous feedback. After bimanual tool motions are captured, derived kinematic metrics are reliable predictors of performance in laparoscopic tasks. Implementing automated tool tracking requires time-intensive human annotation. We developed AI-based tool tracking using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to eliminate the need for human annotators. Here, we describe a study evaluating the usefulness of our tool tracking model in automated assessment during a laparoscopic suturing task in the fundoplication procedure. An automated tool tracking model was applied to recorded videos of Nissen fundoplication on porcine bowel. Surgeons were grouped as novices (PGY1-2) and experts (PGY3-5, attendings). The beginning and end of each suturing step were segmented, and motions of the left and right tools were extracted. A low-pass filter with a 24 Hz cut-off frequency removed noise. Performance was assessed using supervised and unsupervised models, and an ablation study compared results. Kinematic features--RMS velocity, RMS acceleration, RMS jerk, total path length, and Bimanual Dexterity--were extracted and analyzed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost. PCA was performed for feature reduction. For unsupervised learning, a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) model with classifiers, such as a 1-D CNN and traditional models, was trained. Data were extracted for 28 participants (9 novices, 19 experts). Supervised learning with PCA and Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 0.795 and an F1 score of 0.778. The unsupervised 1-D CNN achieved superior results with an accuracy of 0.817 and an F1 score of 0.806, eliminating the need for kinematic feature computation. We demonstrated an AI model capable of automated performance classification, independent of human annotation.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental task in computational photography, aiming to improve illumination, reduce noise, and enhance the image quality of low-light images. While recent advancements primarily focus on customizing complex neural network models, we have observed significant redundancy in these models, limiting further performance improvement. In this paper, we investigate and rethink the model redundancy for LLIE, identifying parameter harmfulness and parameter uselessness. Inspired by the rethinking, we propose two innovative techniques to mitigate model redundancy while improving the LLIE performance: Attention Dynamic Reallocation (ADR) and Parameter Orthogonal Generation (POG). ADR dynamically reallocates appropriate attention based on original attention, thereby mitigating parameter harmfulness. POG learns orthogonal basis embeddings of parameters and prevents degradation to static parameters, thereby mitigating parameter uselessness. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our techniques. We will release the code to the public.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.

Abstract: The flying bird objects captured by surveillance cameras exhibit varying levels of recognition difficulty due to factors such as their varying sizes or degrees of similarity to the background. To alleviate the negative impact of hard samples on training the Flying Bird Object Detection (FBOD) model for surveillance videos, we propose the Co-Paced Learning strategy Based on Confidence (CPL-BC) and apply it to the training process of the FBOD model. This strategy involves maintaining two models with identical structures but different initial parameter configurations that collaborate with each other to select easy samples for training, where the prediction confidence exceeds a set threshold. As training progresses, the strategy gradually lowers the threshold, thereby gradually enhancing the model's ability to recognize objects, from easier to more hard ones. Prior to applying CPL-BC, we pre-trained the two FBOD models to equip them with the capability to assess the difficulty of flying bird object samples. Experimental results on two different datasets of flying bird objects in surveillance videos demonstrate that, compared to other model learning strategies, CPL-BC significantly improves detection accuracy, thereby verifying the method's effectiveness and advancement.

Abstract: Existing 3D reconstruction methods utilize guidances such as 2D images, 3D point clouds, shape contours and single semantics to recover the 3D surface, which limits the creative exploration of 3D modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D modeling task called ``Shape from Semantics'', which aims to create 3D models whose geometry and appearance are consistent with the given text semantics when viewed from different views. The reconstructed 3D models incorporate more than one semantic elements and are easy for observers to distinguish. We adopt generative models as priors and disentangle the connection between geometry and appearance to solve this challenging problem. Specifically, we propose Local Geometry-Aware Distillation (LGAD), a strategy that employs multi-view normal-depth diffusion priors to complete partial geometries, ensuring realistic shape generation. We also integrate view-adaptive guidance scales to enable smooth semantic transitions across views. For appearance modeling, we adopt physically based rendering to generate high-quality material properties, which are subsequently baked into fabricable meshes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate meshes with well-structured, intricately detailed geometries, coherent textures, and smooth transitions, resulting in visually appealing 3D shape designs.

Abstract: Large vision-and-language models (LVLMs) have traditionally integrated visual and textual tokens by concatenating them into a single homogeneous input for large language models (LLMs), thereby maximally preserving the pre-trained language capabilities. However, this constrained architecture for visual and textual tokens restricts the design space for processing visual tokens, potentially leading to suboptimal performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Decomposed Attention (D-Attn), a more flexible attention architecture for LVLMs, which enables modification of visual token operations without affecting textual-to-textual attention. D-Attn decomposes the 1-D causal self-attention of LVLMs into visual-to-visual, textual-to-visual, and textual-to-textual attentions, and the visual and textual output tokens from the decomposed attentions are merged with a carefully derived weighting strategy, namely $\alpha$-weighting. Taking advantage of the flexibility, we are able to introduce two critical improvements in visual token processing while maintaining the capacity of pre-trained LLMs: 1) We rectify the biased positional encoding in textual-to-visual attention to boost visual understanding performance. 2) We diagonalize visual-to-visual attention to reduce computation complexity from $O(|V|^2)$ to $O(|V|)$ for $|V|$ visual tokens without compromising performance. Extensive experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of D-Attn, demonstrating significant improvements on multiple image benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs (\eg, $5\times$ faster). Code will be available at https://github.com/bytedance/DecomposedAttention.

Abstract: 3D face reconstruction from a single sketch is a critical yet underexplored task with significant practical applications. The primary challenges stem from the substantial modality gap between 2D sketches and 3D facial structures, including: (1) accurately extracting facial keypoints from 2D sketches; (2) preserving diverse facial expressions and fine-grained texture details; and (3) training a high-performing model with limited data. In this paper, we propose Sketch-1-to-3, a novel framework for realistic 3D face reconstruction from a single sketch, to address these challenges. Specifically, we first introduce the Geometric Contour and Texture Detail (GCTD) module, which enhances the extraction of geometric contours and texture details from facial sketches. Additionally, we design a deep learning architecture with a domain adaptation module and a tailored loss function to align sketches with the 3D facial space, enabling high-fidelity expression and texture reconstruction. To facilitate evaluation and further research, we construct SketchFaces, a real hand-drawn facial sketch dataset, and Syn-SketchFaces, a synthetic facial sketch dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sketch-1-to-3 achieves state-of-the-art performance in sketch-based 3D face reconstruction.

Abstract: Accurate 3D foot reconstruction is crucial for personalized orthotics, digital healthcare, and virtual fittings. However, existing methods struggle with incomplete scans and anatomical variations, particularly in self-scanning scenarios where user mobility is limited, making it difficult to capture areas like the arch and heel. We present a novel end-to-end pipeline that refines Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction. It first resolves scan alignment ambiguities using SE(3) canonicalization with a viewpoint prediction module, then completes missing geometry through an attention-based network trained on synthetically augmented point clouds. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on reconstruction metrics while preserving clinically validated anatomical fidelity. By combining synthetic training data with learned geometric priors, we enable robust foot reconstruction under real-world capture conditions, unlocking new opportunities for mobile-based 3D scanning in healthcare and retail.

Abstract: We present TopoMortar, a brick wall dataset that is the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate topology-focused image segmentation methods, such as topology loss functions. Motivated by the known sensitivity of methods to dataset challenges, such as small training sets, noisy labels, and out-of-distribution test-set images, TopoMortar is created to enable in two ways investigating methods' effectiveness at improving topology accuracy. First, by eliminating dataset challenges that, as we show, impact the effectiveness of topology loss functions. Second, by allowing to represent different dataset challenges in the same dataset, isolating methods' performance from dataset challenges. TopoMortar includes three types of labels (accurate, pseudo-labels, and noisy labels), two fixed training sets (large and small), and in-distribution and out-of-distribution test-set images. We compared eight loss functions on TopoMortar, and we found that clDice achieved the most topologically accurate segmentations, and that the relative advantageousness of the other loss functions depends on the experimental setting. Additionally, we show that data augmentation and self-distillation can elevate Cross entropy Dice loss to surpass most topology loss functions, and that those simple methods can enhance topology loss functions as well.

Abstract: Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

Abstract: Existing novel object 6D pose estimation methods typically rely on CAD models or dense reference views, which are both difficult to acquire. Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in a common coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative object-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image generation have demonstrated promising results through visual condition control. However, existing ControlNet-like methods struggle with compositional visual conditioning - simultaneously preserving semantic fidelity across multiple heterogeneous control signals while maintaining high visual quality, where they employ separate control branches that often introduce conflicting guidance during the denoising process, leading to structural distortions and artifacts in generated images. To address this issue, we present PixelPonder, a novel unified control framework, which allows for effective control of multiple visual conditions under a single control structure. Specifically, we design a patch-level adaptive condition selection mechanism that dynamically prioritizes spatially relevant control signals at the sub-region level, enabling precise local guidance without global interference. Additionally, a time-aware control injection scheme is deployed to modulate condition influence according to denoising timesteps, progressively transitioning from structural preservation to texture refinement and fully utilizing the control information from different categories to promote more harmonious image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PixelPonder surpasses previous methods across different benchmark datasets, showing superior improvement in spatial alignment accuracy while maintaining high textual semantic consistency.

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture has demonstrated significant successes in various computer vision tasks, such as classification and segmentation. However, its application to optical flow estimation remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce MambaFlow, a novel framework designed to leverage the high accuracy and efficiency of the Mamba architecture for capturing locally correlated features while preserving global information in end-to-end optical flow estimation. To our knowledge, MambaFlow is the first architecture centered around the Mamba design tailored specifically for optical flow estimation. It comprises two key components: (1) PolyMamba, which enhances feature representation through a dual-Mamba architecture, incorporating a Self-Mamba module for intra-token modeling and a Cross-Mamba module for inter-modality interaction, enabling both deep contextualization and effective feature fusion; and (2) PulseMamba, which leverages an Attention Guidance Aggregator (AGA) to adaptively integrate features with dynamically learned weights in contrast to naive concatenation, and then employs the intrinsic recurrent mechanism of Mamba to perform autoregressive flow decoding, facilitating efficient flow information dissemination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaFlow achieves remarkable results comparable to mainstream methods on benchmark datasets. Compared to SEA-RAFT, MambaFlow attains higher accuracy on the Sintel benchmark, demonstrating stronger potential for real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: We present SKALD, a multi-shot video assembly method that constructs coherent video sequences from candidate shots with minimal reliance on text. Central to our approach is the Learned Clip Assembly (LCA) score, a learning-based metric that measures temporal and semantic relationships between shots to quantify narrative coherence. We tackle the exponential complexity of combining multiple shots with an efficient beam-search algorithm guided by the LCA score. To train our model effectively with limited human annotations, we propose two tasks for the LCA encoder: Shot Coherence Learning, which uses contrastive learning to distinguish coherent and incoherent sequences, and Feature Regression, which converts these learned representations into a real-valued coherence score. We develop two variants: a base SKALD model that relies solely on visual coherence and SKALD-text, which integrates auxiliary text information when available. Experiments on the VSPD and our curated MSV3C datasets show that SKALD achieves an improvement of up to 48.6% in IoU and a 43% speedup over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Image generation has witnessed significant advancements in the past few years. However, evaluating the performance of image generation models remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we propose ICE-Bench, a unified and comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously assess image generation models. Its comprehensiveness could be summarized in the following key features: (1) Coarse-to-Fine Tasks: We systematically deconstruct image generation into four task categories: No-ref/Ref Image Creating/Editing, based on the presence or absence of source images and reference images. And further decompose them into 31 fine-grained tasks covering a broad spectrum of image generation requirements, culminating in a comprehensive benchmark. (2) Multi-dimensional Metrics: The evaluation framework assesses image generation capabilities across 6 dimensions: aesthetic quality, imaging quality, prompt following, source consistency, reference consistency, and controllability. 11 metrics are introduced to support the multi-dimensional evaluation. Notably, we introduce VLLM-QA, an innovative metric designed to assess the success of image editing by leveraging large models. (3) Hybrid Data: The data comes from real scenes and virtual generation, which effectively improves data diversity and alleviates the bias problem in model evaluation. Through ICE-Bench, we conduct a thorough analysis of existing generation models, revealing both the challenging nature of our benchmark and the gap between current model capabilities and real-world generation requirements. To foster further advancements in the field, we will open-source ICE-Bench, including its dataset, evaluation code, and models, thereby providing a valuable resource for the research community.

Abstract: Precisely evaluating semantic alignment between text prompts and generated videos remains a challenge in Text-to-Video (T2V) Generation. Existing text-to-video alignment metrics like CLIPScore only generate coarse-grained scores without fine-grained alignment details, failing to align with human preference. To address this limitation, we propose ETVA, a novel Evaluation method of Text-to-Video Alignment via fine-grained question generation and answering. First, a multi-agent system parses prompts into semantic scene graphs to generate atomic questions. Then we design a knowledge-augmented multi-stage reasoning framework for question answering, where an auxiliary LLM first retrieves relevant common-sense knowledge (e.g., physical laws), and then video LLM answers the generated questions through a multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ETVA achieves a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 58.47, showing a much higher correlation with human judgment than existing metrics which attain only 31.0. We also construct a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for text-to-video alignment evaluation, featuring 2k diverse prompts and 12k atomic questions spanning 10 categories. Through a systematic evaluation of 15 existing text-to-video models, we identify their key capabilities and limitations, paving the way for next-generation T2V generation.

Abstract: Video large language models (ViLLMs) excel in general video understanding, e.g., recognizing activities like talking and eating, but struggle with identity-aware comprehension, such as "Wilson is receiving chemotherapy" or "Tom is discussing with Sarah", limiting their applicability in smart healthcare and smart home environments. To address this limitation, we propose a one-shot learning framework PVChat, the first personalized ViLLM that enables subject-aware question answering (QA) from a single video for each subject. Our approach optimizes a Mixture-of-Heads (MoH) enhanced ViLLM on a synthetically augmented video-QA dataset, leveraging a progressive image-to-video learning strategy. Specifically, we introduce an automated augmentation pipeline that synthesizes identity-preserving positive samples and retrieves hard negatives from existing video corpora, generating a diverse training dataset with four QA types: existence, appearance, action, and location inquiries. To enhance subject-specific learning, we propose a ReLU Routing MoH attention mechanism, alongside two novel objectives: (1) Smooth Proximity Regularization for progressive learning through exponential distance scaling and (2) Head Activation Enhancement for balanced attention routing. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy, transitioning from image pre-training to video fine-tuning, enabling a gradual learning process from static attributes to dynamic representations. We evaluate PVChat on diverse datasets covering medical scenarios, TV series, anime, and real-world footage, demonstrating its superiority in personalized feature understanding after learning from a single video, compared to state-of-the-art ViLLMs.

Abstract: Gait recognition is emerging as a promising and innovative area within the field of computer vision, widely applied to remote person identification. Although existing gait recognition methods have achieved substantial success in controlled laboratory datasets, their performance often declines significantly when transitioning to wild datasets.We argue that the performance gap can be primarily attributed to the spatio-temporal distribution inconsistencies present in wild datasets, where subjects appear at varying angles, positions, and distances across the frames. To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild, we propose a skeleton-guided silhouette alignment strategy, which uses prior knowledge of the skeletons to perform affine transformations on the corresponding silhouettes.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of data alignment on gait recognition. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets and network architectures, and the results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed alignment strategy.Specifically, on the challenging Gait3D dataset, our method achieved an average performance improvement of 7.9% across all evaluated networks. Furthermore, our method achieves substantial improvements on cross-domain datasets, with accuracy improvements of up to 24.0%.

Abstract: Bin-picking of metal objects using low-cost RGB-D cameras often suffers from sparse depth information and reflective surface textures, leading to errors and the need for manual labeling. To reduce human intervention, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of a metric learning stage and a self-training stage. Specifically, to automatically process data captured by a low-cost camera (LC), we introduce a Multi-object Pose Reasoning (MoPR) algorithm that optimizes pose hypotheses under depth, collision, and boundary constraints. To further refine pose candidates, we adopt a Symmetry-aware Lie-group based Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (SaL-BGMM), integrated with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, for symmetry-aware filtering. Additionally, we propose a Weighted Ranking Information Noise Contrastive Estimation (WR-InfoNCE) loss to enable the LC to learn a perceptual metric from reconstructed data, supporting self-training on untrained or even unseen objects. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on both the ROBI dataset and our newly introduced Self-ROBI dataset.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation often involves inherent uncertainty due to variations in expert annotations. Capturing this uncertainty is an important goal and previous works have used various generative image models for the purpose of representing the full distribution of plausible expert ground truths. In this work, we explore the design space of diffusion models for generative segmentation, investigating the impact of noise schedules, prediction types, and loss weightings. Notably, we find that making the noise schedule harder with input scaling significantly improves performance. We conclude that x- and v-prediction outperform epsilon-prediction, likely because the diffusion process is in the discrete segmentation domain. Many loss weightings achieve similar performance as long as they give enough weight to the end of the diffusion process. We base our experiments on the LIDC-IDRI lung lesion dataset and obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, we introduce a randomly cropped variant of the LIDC-IDRI dataset that is better suited for uncertainty in image segmentation. Our model also achieves SOTA in this harder setting.

Abstract: We propose DLTPose, a novel method for 6DoF object pose estimation from RGBD images that combines the accuracy of sparse keypoint methods with the robustness of dense pixel-wise predictions. DLTPose predicts per-pixel radial distances to a set of minimally four keypoints, which are then fed into our novel Direct Linear Transform (DLT) formulation to produce accurate 3D object frame surface estimates, leading to better 6DoF pose estimation. Additionally, we introduce a novel symmetry-aware keypoint ordering approach, designed to handle object symmetries that otherwise cause inconsistencies in keypoint assignments. Previous keypoint-based methods relied on fixed keypoint orderings, which failed to account for the multiple valid configurations exhibited by symmetric objects, which our ordering approach exploits to enhance the model's ability to learn stable keypoint representations. Extensive experiments on the benchmark LINEMOD, Occlusion LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets show that DLTPose outperforms existing methods, especially for symmetric and occluded objects. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DLTPose_/ .

Abstract: Recent video generation research has focused heavily on isolated actions, leaving interactive motions-such as hand-face interactions-largely unexamined. These interactions are essential for emerging biometric authentication systems, which rely on interactive motion-based anti-spoofing approaches. From a security perspective, there is a growing need for large-scale, high-quality interactive videos to train and strengthen authentication models. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for animating realistic hand-face interactions. Our approach simultaneously learns spatio-temporal contact dynamics and biomechanically plausible deformation effects, enabling natural interactions where hand movements induce anatomically accurate facial deformations while maintaining collision-free contact. To facilitate this research, we present InterHF, a large-scale hand-face interaction dataset featuring 18 interaction patterns and 90,000 annotated videos. Additionally, we propose InterAnimate, a region-aware diffusion model designed specifically for interaction animation. InterAnimate leverages learnable spatial and temporal latents to effectively capture dynamic interaction priors and integrates a region-aware interaction mechanism that injects these priors into the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first large-scale effort to systematically study human hand-face interactions. Qualitative and quantitative results show InterAnimate produces highly realistic animations, setting a new benchmark. Code and data will be made public to advance research.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on modeling cross-domain preferences through intra- and inter-sequence item relationships. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose Hierarchical Attention Fusion of Visual and Textual Representations (HAF-VT), a novel approach integrating visual and textual data to enhance cognitive modeling. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, enriching item representations with multimodal data. A hierarchical attention mechanism jointly learns single-domain and cross-domain preferences, mimicking human information integration. Evaluated on four e-commerce datasets, HAF-VT outperforms existing methods in capturing cross-domain user interests, bridging cognitive principles with computational models and highlighting the role of multimodal data in sequential decision-making.

Abstract: With the emergence of transformer-based architectures and large language models (LLMs), the accuracy of road scene perception has substantially advanced. Nonetheless, current road scene segmentation approaches are predominantly trained on closed-set data, resulting in insufficient detection capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. To overcome this limitation, road anomaly detection methods have been proposed. However, existing methods primarily depend on image inpainting and OOD distribution detection techniques, facing two critical issues: (1) inadequate consideration of the objectiveness attributes of anomalous regions, causing incomplete segmentation when anomalous objects share similarities with known classes, and (2) insufficient attention to environmental constraints, leading to the detection of anomalies irrelevant to autonomous driving tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-Awareness (SOTA) for autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, SOTA enhances the segmentation of objectiveness through a Semantic Fusion Block (SFB) and filters anomalies irrelevant to road navigation tasks using a Scene-understanding Guided Prompt-Context Adaptor (SG-PCA). Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fishyscapes Lost and Found, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and RoadAnomaly, demonstrate that the proposed SOTA consistently improves OOD detection performance across diverse detectors, achieving robust and accurate segmentation outcomes.

Abstract: An immersive acoustic experience enabled by spatial audio is just as crucial as the visual aspect in creating realistic virtual environments. However, existing methods for room impulse response estimation rely either on data-demanding learning-based models or computationally expensive physics-based modeling. In this work, we introduce Audio-Visual Differentiable Room Acoustic Rendering (AV-DAR), a framework that leverages visual cues extracted from multi-view images and acoustic beam tracing for physics-based room acoustic rendering. Experiments across six real-world environments from two datasets demonstrate that our multimodal, physics-based approach is efficient, interpretable, and accurate, significantly outperforming a series of prior methods. Notably, on the Real Acoustic Field dataset, AV-DAR achieves comparable performance to models trained on 10 times more data while delivering relative gains ranging from 16.6% to 50.9% when trained at the same scale.

Abstract: Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community. The references associated with this survey are available on GitHub (https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Awesome-Unified-Multimodal-Models).

Abstract: Language-augmented scene representations hold great promise for large-scale robotics applications such as search-and-rescue, smart cities, and mining. Many of these scenarios are time-sensitive, requiring rapid scene encoding while also being data-intensive, necessitating scalable solutions. Deploying these representations on robots with limited computational resources further adds to the challenge. To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding. Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets.

Abstract: Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) faces significant challenges in real-world applications due to incomplete, degraded, or missing sensor data. While current MMSS methods typically use self-distillation with modality dropout to improve robustness, they largely overlook inter-modal correlations and thus suffer significant performance degradation when no modalities are missing. To this end, we present RMMSS, a two-stage framework designed to progressively enhance model robustness under missing-modality conditions, while maintaining strong performance in full-modality scenarios. It comprises two key components: the Hybrid Prototype Distillation Module (HPDM) and the Feature Selection Module (FSM). In the first stage, we pre-train the teacher model with full-modality data and then introduce HPDM to do cross-modal knowledge distillation for obtaining a highly robust model. In the second stage, we freeze both the pre-trained full-modality teacher model and the robust model and propose a trainable FSM that extracts optimal representations from both the feature and logits layers of the models via feature score calculation. This process learns a final student model that maintains strong robustness while achieving high performance under full-modality conditions. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method improves missing-modality performance by 2.80%, 3.89%, and 0.89%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art, while causing almost no drop in full-modality performance (only -0.1% mIoU). Meanwhile, different backbones (AnySeg and CMNeXt) are utilized to validate the generalizability of our framework.

Abstract: The matching formulation makes it naturally hard for the stereo matching to handle ill-posed regions like occlusions and non-Lambertian surfaces. Fusing monocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased monocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the generalization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the unbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the generalization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and observe three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The first problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular depth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular feature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity update leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map could alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed at the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we propose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the depth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute depth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight the initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In addition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the disparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression module can globally and adaptively align them. Our method fully exploits the monocular prior to support stereo matching results effectively and efficiently. We significantly improve the performance from the experiments when generalizing from SceneFlow to Middlebury and Booster datasets while barely reducing the efficiency.

Abstract: Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity. We train CLIP using our hard negative learning method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o. We further conduct ablation studies to analyze three key factors: hard negative types, the efficiency of image-based negatives, and training configurations. These analyses yield important insights into optimizing hard negative strategies for geometric reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables deep networks to acquire new knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.

Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Human evaluation studies validate our framework's alignment with human decision-making patterns, and generalization experiments demonstrate effective performance on novel tool categories. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, elongation, hand-relatedness) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.

However, most existing approaches focus on segmenting only the referred object (typically the actor), even when the expression clearly describes an interaction involving multiple objects with distinct roles. For instance, "A throwing B" implies a directional interaction, but standard RVOS segments only the actor (A), neglecting other involved target objects (B). In this paper, we introduce Interaction-aware Referring Video Object Segmentation (InterRVOS), a novel task that focuses on the modeling of interactions. It requires the model to segment the actor and target objects separately, reflecting their asymmetric roles in an interaction. This task formulation enables fine-grained understanding of object relationships, as many video events are defined by such relationships rather than individual objects. To support this task, we propose a new evaluation protocol that separately evaluates actor and target segmentation, enabling more accurate assessment of the model's ability to distinguish and segment actor and target roles. We also present InterRVOS-127K, a large-scale dataset with over 127K automatically annotated expressions, including interaction expressions annotated with distinct masks for actor and target objects. Furthermore, we develop ReVIOSa, an MLLM-based architecture that introduces interaction-aware special tokens and leverages an attention mask loss to enhance role-specific segmentation. Extensive experiments show that ReVIOSa not only outperforms existing baselines on our proposed InterRVOS-127K evaluation set, but also achieves strong performance on standard RVOS benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention, but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an advancement in hyperspectral data generation.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits. First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video (I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our key innovation is using a spatiotemporal mask to strategically guide the LoRA fine-tuning process. This teaches the model two distinct skills: first, to interpret the mask as a command to either preserve content from the source video or generate new content in designated regions. Second, for these generated regions, LoRA learns to synthesize either temporally consistent motion inherited from the video or novel appearances guided by user-provided reference frames. This dual-capability LoRA grants users control over the edit's entire temporal evolution, allowing complex transformations like an object rotating or a flower blooming. Experimental results show our method achieves superior video editing performance compared to baseline methods. Project Page: https://cjeen.github.io/LoRAEdit

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to visual hallucinations (VH), often producing confident but inaccurate descriptions of visual content. Building on the insight that not all tokens and attention heads contribute equally to VH mitigation, we introduce VisFlow, a lightweight and training-free framework that alleviates hallucinations by directly modulating attention patterns during inference. To address two primary challenges of VH, namely insufficient visual attention and the dominance of language priors, we identify three problematic attention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) disproportionate allocation of attention to uninformative or trailing visual tokens, (2) over-dependence on the previously generated token, and (3) excessive fixation on system prompts that hinders multimodal integration. To overcome these issues, VisFlow introduces a dual-level Attention Intervention, consisting of Token-level Attention Intervention (TAI), which reinforces attention to salient visual regions, and Head-level Attention Intervention (HAI), which suppresses undue focus on system prompts and adjacent text tokens. Together, these interventions strengthen visual alignment while reducing linguistic bias. Extensive experiments across diverse models and benchmarks demonstrate that VisFlow effectively mitigates hallucinations with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Video object removal and inpainting are critical tasks in the fields of computer vision and multimedia processing, aimed at restoring missing or corrupted regions in video sequences. Traditional methods predominantly rely on flow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches face limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and ensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when dealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel video inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT synergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer architectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring high-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy to further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage. Additionally, the proposed method interactively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts. In terms of processing speed, it takes only 65 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA H800 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $2160 \times 2100$ with 97 frames without any acceleration method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in content fidelity, texture restoration, and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation, searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension, retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs, tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy. Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead.

Abstract: Zero-shot and prompt-based models have excelled at visual reasoning tasks by leveraging large-scale natural image corpora, but they often fail on sparse and domain-specific scientific image data. We introduce Zenesis, a no-code interactive computer vision platform designed to reduce data readiness bottlenecks in scientific imaging workflows. Zenesis integrates lightweight multimodal adaptation for zero-shot inference on raw scientific data, human-in-the-loop refinement, and heuristic-based temporal enhancement. We validate our approach on Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) datasets of catalyst-loaded membranes. Zenesis outperforms baselines, achieving an average accuracy of 0.947, Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.858, and Dice score of 0.923 on amorphous catalyst samples; and 0.987 accuracy, 0.857 IoU, and 0.923 Dice on crystalline samples. These results represent a significant performance gain over conventional methods such as Otsu thresholding and standalone models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Zenesis enables effective image segmentation in domains where annotated datasets are limited, offering a scalable solution for scientific discovery.

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets, the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/fz-zsl/AQuA.

<title>Degradation-Agnostic Statistical Facial Feature Transformation for Blind Face Restoration in Adverse Weather Conditions</title>

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Interpretability is critical in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, where understanding model decisions is essential for clinical adoption. In this work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast imaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level \texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and \textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast concept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE latent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings of foundation models at every layer for breast imaging. The code will be released at https://krishnakanthnakka.github.io/MammoSAE/

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image generation, producing high-quality visuals from natural language prompts. However, when prompts involve multiple objects alongside global or local style instructions, the outputs often drift in style and lose spatial coherence, limiting their reliability for controlled, style-consistent scene generation. We present Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA), a lightweight, training-free method that splits the prompt into content and style tokens, then injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at chosen timesteps. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in the denoising process, LPA improves both layout control and stylistic uniformity without additional training cost. We conduct extensive ablations across parser settings and injection windows, finding that the best configuration -- lpa late only with a 300-650 step window -- delivers the strongest balance of prompt alignment and style consistency. On the T2I benchmark, LPA improves CLIP-prompt alignment over vanilla SDXL by +0.41% and over SD1.5 by +0.34%, with no diversity loss. On our custom 50-prompt style-rich benchmark, LPA achieves +0.09% CLIP-prompt and +0.08% CLIP-style gains over baseline. Our method is model-agnostic, easy to integrate, and requires only a single configuration change, making it a practical choice for controllable, style-consistent multi-object generation.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However, detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to better extract key facial features and improve detection performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and reliable drowsiness detection.

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) benchmark.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation (FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores (FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp (ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{delta-homology analogy}, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A \emph{Dirac delta-like memory trace} \( \delta_\gamma \) is identified with a nontrivial homology generator \( [\gamma] \in H_1(\mathcal{Z}) \) on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. Based on the analogy, we propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics and persistent homology. Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct \emph{spatiotemporal complexes} whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into \emph{cell posets}, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of model selection under domain shift. Motivated by principles from distributionally robust optimisation and domain adaptation theory, it is proposed that the training-validation split should maximise the distribution mismatch between the two sets. By adopting the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as the measure of mismatch, it is shown that the partitioning problem reduces to kernel k-means clustering. A constrained clustering algorithm, which leverages linear programming to control the size, label, and (optionally) group distributions of the splits, is presented. The algorithm does not require additional metadata, and comes with convergence guarantees. In experiments, the technique consistently outperforms alternative splitting strategies across a range of datasets and training algorithms, for both domain generalisation and unsupervised domain adaptation tasks. Analysis also shows the MMD between the training and validation sets to be well-correlated with test domain accuracy, further substantiating the validity of this approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.

Abstract: Efficient detection and classification of blood cells are vital for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of blood disorders. This study utilizes a YOLOv10 model trained on Roboflow data with images resized to 640x640 pixels across varying epochs. The results show that increased training epochs significantly enhance accuracy, precision, and recall, particularly in real-time blood cell detection & classification. The YOLOv10 model outperforms MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and DarkNet in real-time performance, though MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2 are more computationally efficient, and DarkNet excels in feature extraction for blood cell classification. This research highlights the potential of integrating deep learning models like YOLOv10, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and DarkNet into clinical workflows, promising improvements in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, a new, well-annotated blood cell dataset was created and will be open-sourced to support further advancements in automatic blood cell detection and classification. The findings demonstrate the transformative impact of these models in revolutionizing medical diagnostics and enhancing blood disorder management

<title>Communicate Less, Synthesize the Rest: Latency-aware Intent-based Generative Semantic Multicasting with Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality, enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.

Abstract: We present a fast and accurate solution to the perspective $n$-points problem, by way of a new approach to the n=4 case. Our solution hinges on a novel separation of variables: given four 3D points and four corresponding 2D points on the camera canvas, we start by finding another set of 3D points, sitting on the rays connecting the camera to the 2D canvas points, so that the six pair-wise distances between these 3D points are as close as possible to the six distances between the original 3D points. This step reduces the perspective problem to an absolute orientation problem, which has a solution via explicit formula. To solve the first problem we set coordinates which are as orientation-free as possible: on the 3D points side our coordinates are the squared distances between the points. On the 2D canvas-points side our coordinates are the dot products of the points after rotating one of them to sit on the optical axis. We then derive the solution with the help of a computer algebra system. Our solution is an order of magnitude faster than state of the art algorithms, while offering similar accuracy under realistic noise. Moreover, our reduction to the absolute orientation problem runs two orders of magnitude faster than other perspective problem solvers, allowing extremely efficient seed rejection when implementing RANSAC.

Abstract: Learning diffusion bridge models is easy; making them fast and practical is an art. Diffusion bridge models (DBMs) are a promising extension of diffusion models for applications in image-to-image translation. However, like many modern diffusion and flow models, DBMs suffer from the problem of slow inference. To address it, we propose a novel distillation technique based on the inverse bridge matching formulation and derive the tractable objective to solve it in practice. Unlike previously developed DBM distillation techniques, the proposed method can distill both conditional and unconditional types of DBMs, distill models in a one-step generator, and use only the corrupted images for training. We evaluate our approach for both conditional and unconditional types of bridge matching on a wide set of setups, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, sketch-to-image, and other tasks, and show that our distillation technique allows us to accelerate the inference of DBMs from 4x to 100x and even provide better generation quality than used teacher model depending on particular setup.

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid scintigraphy plays a vital role in diagnosing a range of thyroid disorders. While deep learning classification models hold significant promise in this domain, their effectiveness is frequently compromised by limited and imbalanced datasets. This study investigates the impact of three data augmentation strategies including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA), on enhancing the performance of a ResNet18 classifier.
  Methods: Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,954 patients across nine medical centers were classified into four categories: Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI). Data augmentation was performed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation scenarios. Each augmented dataset was used to train a ResNet18 classifier. Model performance was assessed using class-wise and average precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and image fidelity metrics (FID and KID).
  Results: FM-based augmentation outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest classification accuracy and lowest FID/KID scores, indicating both improved model generalization and realistic image synthesis. SD1, combining image and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD variant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful clinical context. O+FM+CA yielded the most balanced and robust performance across all classes.
  Conclusion: Integrating FM and clinically-informed SD augmentation, especially when guided by expert prompts, substantially improves thyroid scintigraphy classification. These findings highlight the importance of leveraging both structured medical input and advanced generative models for more effective training on limited datasets.

Abstract: Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images are the biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, which are rising in prevalence. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease using retinal OCT is a primary challenging task. This work utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to classify retinal OCT images of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls (CO). The goal is to enhance diagnostic capabilities through efficient image analysis. In the proposed model, Raw OCT images have been preprocessed with ImageJ and given to various deep-learning models to evaluate the accuracy. The best classification architecture is TransNetOCT, which has an average accuracy of 98.18% for input OCT images and 98.91% for segmented OCT images for five-fold cross-validation compared to other models, and the Swin Transformer model has achieved an accuracy of 93.54%. The evaluation accuracy metric demonstrated TransNetOCT and Swin transformer models capability to classify AD and CO subjects reliably, contributing to the potential for improved diagnostic processes in clinical settings.

<title>Deep Positive-Negative Prototypes for Adversarially Robust Discriminative Prototypical Learning</title>

Abstract: Despite the advantages of discriminative prototype-based methods, their role in adversarial robustness remains underexplored. Meanwhile, current adversarial training methods predominantly focus on robustness against adversarial attacks without explicitly leveraging geometric structures in the latent space, usually resulting in reduced accuracy on the original clean data. We propose a novel framework named Adversarially trained Deep Positive-Negative Prototypes (Adv-DPNP), which integrates discriminative prototype-based learning with adversarial training. Adv-DPNP uses unified class prototypes that serve as both classifier weights and robust anchors in the latent space. Moreover, a novel dual-branch training mechanism maintains stable prototypes by updating them exclusively with clean data, while the feature extractor is trained on both clean and adversarial inputs to increase invariance to adversarial perturbations. In addition, we use a composite loss that combines positive-prototype alignment, negative-prototype repulsion, and consistency regularization to further enhance discrimination, adversarial robustness, and clean accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN) confirm that Adv-DPNP improves clean accuracy over state-of-the-art defenses and baseline methods, while maintaining competitive or superior robustness under a suite of widely used attacks, including FGSM, PGD, C\&amp;W, and AutoAttack. We also evaluate robustness to common corruptions on CIFAR-10-C, where Adv-DPNP achieves the highest average accuracy across severities and corruption types. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the discriminative quality of the learned feature representations, highlighting the effectiveness of Adv-DPNP in maintaining compactness and clear separation in the latent space.

<title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering</title>

arXiv:2505.02369v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

Abstract: In this work we present WIR3D, a technique for abstracting 3D shapes through a sparse set of visually meaningful curves in 3D. We optimize the parameters of Bezier curves such that they faithfully represent both the geometry and salient visual features (e.g. texture) of the shape from arbitrary viewpoints. We leverage the intermediate activations of a pre-trained foundation model (CLIP) to guide our optimization process. We divide our optimization into two phases: one for capturing the coarse geometry of the shape, and the other for representing fine-grained features. Our second phase supervision is spatially guided by a novel localized keypoint loss. This spatial guidance enables user control over abstracted features. We ensure fidelity to the original surface through a neural SDF loss, which allows the curves to be used as intuitive deformation handles. We successfully apply our method for shape abstraction over a broad dataset of shapes with varying complexity, geometric structure, and texture, and demonstrate downstream applications for feature control and shape deformation.

Abstract: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-language retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become an effective approach for tackling Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), which requires external knowledge beyond the visual content presented in images. The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.

Abstract: Real robots are expected to repeat the same behavior in new environments with very little new data, yet modern controllers either incur heavy per-step inference or require deployment-time fine-tuning. We propose RT-Cache, a training-free retrieval-as-control pipeline that caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and, at test time, embeds the current frame to retrieve and replay multi-step snippets, replacing per-step model calls. A hierarchical search keeps lookups sub-second at million scale, shifting cost from compute to storage and enabling real-time control on modest GPUs. Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher success and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines (approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a single-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex, contact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an append-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment today and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with high-level policies.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature, comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.

<title>InsightX Agent: An LMM-based Agentic Framework with Integrated Tools for Reliable X-ray NDT Analysis</title>

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach. Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from 124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA, CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C, convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters. Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH segmentation.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable directions for future research.

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction, embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format, perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions. Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of our knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with reasoning into affordance reasoning. The code of our method and our dataset is released on https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.

Abstract: Synthesizing motion-rich and temporally consistent videos remains a challenge in artificial intelligence, especially when dealing with extended durations. Existing text-to-video (T2V) models commonly employ spatial cross-attention for text control, equivalently guiding different frame generations without frame-specific textual guidance. Thus, the model's capacity to comprehend the temporal logic conveyed in prompts and generate videos with coherent motion is restricted. To tackle this limitation, we introduce FancyVideo, an innovative video generator that improves the existing text-control mechanism with the well-designed Cross-frame Textual Guidance Module (CTGM). Specifically, CTGM incorporates the Temporal Information Injector (TII) and Temporal Affinity Refiner (TAR) at the beginning and end of cross-attention, respectively, to achieve frame-specific textual guidance. Firstly, TII injects frame-specific information from latent features into text conditions, thereby obtaining cross-frame textual conditions. Then, TAR refines the correlation matrix between cross-frame textual conditions and latent features along the time dimension. Extensive experiments comprising both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FancyVideo. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art T2V generation results on the EvalCrafter benchmark and facilitates the synthesis of dynamic and consistent videos. Note that the T2V process of FancyVideo essentially involves a text-to-image step followed by T+I2V. This means it also supports the generation of videos from user images, i.e., the image-to-video (I2V) task. A significant number of experiments have shown that its performance is also outstanding.

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding, comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs, highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and propose promising research directions.

Summary:
The Value Sign Flip (VSF) method introduces a simple and efficient way to incorporate negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching image generation models. Unlike existing approaches, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. This method shows superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs. VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence in few-step models compared to prior methods and even outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality. The method integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures and cross-attention-based models, making it versatile for various model types. The code and ComfyUI node for VSF are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of accurate camera localization in retail settings and introduces a novel approach that combines Absolute Pose Regression (APR) and Relative Pose Regression (RPR) using Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs). The PAE-based RPR is shown to be effective in enhancing localization accuracy by incorporating visual and spatial scene priors. The study compares PAE-based RPR with image-based RPR models and demonstrates the superiority of the former. A refinement strategy is proposed, which refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. The method significantly improves localization accuracy on indoor benchmarks and achieves competitive performance even with limited training data. This approach reduces the data collection burden for retail deployment, making it a practical solution for enhancing customer experiences and streamlining operations in retail environments. <div>

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments, enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs) have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR, without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing the data collection burden for retail deployment.

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios, including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around 100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI systems.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces HQ-OV3D, a framework aimed at enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary 3D detection. Traditional closed-set methods fall short in open-world applications like autonomous driving, prompting the need for improved detection frameworks. HQ-OV3D consists of an IMCV Proposal Generator for high-quality 3D proposals and an ACA Denoiser for refining proposals using geometric priors from annotated classes. By leveraging cross-modality consistency and a DDIM-based denoising mechanism, the framework significantly improves bounding box precision and achieves a 7.37% mAP increase on novel classes compared to existing methods. HQ-OV3D not only functions as a standalone detector but also as a high-quality pseudo-label generator for other open-vocabulary detection pipelines, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in addressing the limitations of current methods. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.10935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision, remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA) Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary detection or annotation pipelines.

<div> Sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting, collaborative perception, 3D semantic occupancy prediction, connected vehicles, communication efficiency<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
This article introduces a new approach for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction in connected vehicles. By utilizing sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting, the method enhances communication efficiency by sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian primitives. This approach offers neighborhood-based cross-agent fusion, joint encoding of geometry and semantics, and sparse, object-centric messages. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods in mIoU and IoU metrics. Even with reduced communication volume, the method maintains robust performance, demonstrating a significant improvement in mIoU using only a fraction of the original communication budget. <div>
arXiv:2508.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information, overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU, respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6% communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited communication budgets.

<div> Keywords: face super-resolution, extreme degradation, identity consistency, masking, warping

Summary:
The article introduces a novel face super-resolution method called IDFSR, which aims to enhance identity restoration under extreme scaling factors while reducing hallucination effects. The method involves masking unreliable identity cues in low-resolution images, warping a reference image for style guidance, and utilizing identity embeddings for fine-grained ID modeling. The approach first pretrains a diffusion-based model to decouple style and identity and then fine-tunes the identity embedding using target ID images for personalized adaptation. The IDFSR method significantly improves identity consistency and perceptual quality, outperforming existing approaches under extreme degradation conditions. Extensive evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of IDFSR in preserving critical attributes and ID information in super-resolved faces. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID) consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios (e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects. Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2) \textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT) images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID consistency.

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management. Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3, and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum, Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

Summary:
Artcodes are decorative markers that encode information into their topology, blending into their surroundings. Recognizing these Artcodes, a form of topological objects, is crucial for interacting with virtual elements in our environment. A new feature descriptor called the shape of orientation histogram is proposed to represent the topological structure of Artcodes. Through experiments and dataset collection, the feasibility and effectiveness of this feature descriptor in detecting Artcode proposals are demonstrated. This innovative system paves the way for detecting similar topological objects, creating new interaction possibilities and potential applications in the detection of topological objects like Artcodes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection, a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark potential applications of topological object detection.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting -- characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance. This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT). In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of 50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822 and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based structural analysis of composite preforms.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection, Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000 frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable, offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at https://smlab.niser.ac.in/project/iwatchroad

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the challenges posed by adversarial patches in computer vision tasks, particularly object detection. It introduces Incremental Patch Generation (IPG) as a method to efficiently generate adversarial patches, demonstrating its ability to create well-generalized patches that cover a broad range of model vulnerabilities. The efficacy of IPG is supported by experiments and ablation studies, showing its potential to enhance AI model robustness. The generated datasets can also be used to build a robust defense system for AI security. The study suggests that IPG not only enhances adversarial patch defense but also holds promise for applications in areas like autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models need to withstand adversarial attacks in dynamic environments. <div>

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore, IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction, multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of robust and trustworthy medical AI.

<div> Keywords: Fiber Orientation Distribution, Diffusion MRI, Deep Learning, Neurological Disorders, Clinical Validation

Summary:
FastFOD-Net is a newly optimized deep learning framework designed to enhance Fiber Orientation Distributions (FODs) in diffusion MRI data. The framework has been validated across healthy controls and six neurological disorders, showcasing superior performance and efficiency compared to previous methods. By providing an accelerated and robust enhancement of FODs, FastFOD-Net has the potential to accelerate clinical neuroscience research, enable more precise diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, enhance interpretability in connectome applications, and reduce measurement errors to lower sample size requirements. The comprehensive clinical evaluation of FastFOD-Net demonstrates its capability to analyze real-world clinical diffusion MRI data effectively, making it comparable to high-quality research acquisitions. This work paves the way for widespread adoption of deep learning-based methods in diffusion MRI enhancement and builds trust in their use in clinical settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders. This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with high-quality research acquisitions.

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data, poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance. Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools: (1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities, offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

<div> Representative types, reasoning levels, object property dimensions, VQA benchmark, ORBIT  
Summary:  
ORBIT introduces a new evaluation framework for vision-language models (VLMs) in the context of object property reasoning in visual question answering (VQA). The benchmark consists of 360 images paired with count-based questions that test reasoning skills at varying levels of complexity. By evaluating 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on this benchmark, the study highlights significant limitations in the models' ability to abstract and reason over depicted objects when compared to human performance. VLMs struggle with realistic images, counterfactual reasoning about object properties, and higher counts. The findings suggest a need for scalable benchmarking methods, generalized annotation guidelines, and further exploration of reasoning VLMs in the field. The ORBIT benchmark and experimental code are made publicly available to support future research in this area.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic (photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available to support such endeavors.

<div> Hyperspectral imaging, Vulnerable Road Users, metamerism, band selection, material signatures<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The study focuses on using hyperspectral imaging to improve automotive perception systems' ability to protect Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) by overcoming visual ambiguity caused by metamerism. By capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum, particularly in the Near-Infrared (NIR), the study aims to enhance VRU separability from the background. A band selection strategy integrating information theory techniques and an image quality metric identified three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm) in the Hyperspectral City V2 dataset. Quantitative results demonstrated increased dissimilarity and perceptual separability of VRU from the background, with significant improvements in dissimilarity and perception metrics compared to RGB imaging. The selected HSI bands consistently outperformed RGB, reducing metameric confusion and enhancing VRU separability, which is essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) to improve road safety. <div>
arXiv:2508.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum, especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB. Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity (Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability, establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately contributing to improved road safety.

<div> control generation, DiT-ControlNet, EVCtrl, spatio-temporal dual caching, efficiency

Summary:
EVCtrl is a lightweight control adapter for visual generation models such as DiT-ControlNet, aimed at reducing latency and redundant computation. By utilizing a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy, EVCtrl efficiently handles sparse control information without requiring model retraining. It profiles layer responses to control signals and partitions the network into global and local functional zones to focus computation on relevant areas. Additionally, EVCtrl selectively skips denoising steps to enhance temporal efficiency. Experimental results on various datasets show significant speedups with minimal impact on generation quality. For instance, EVCtrl achieves notable speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet. This approach provides a practical solution for achieving controlled image and video generation without compromising performance. EVCtrl's codes are also available for further investigation and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Summary: 
- Vision language models (VLMs) have shown the ability to simulate general human behavior but have not been explored in the accessibility domain. 
- A benchmark dataset was created through a survey study with low vision participants to evaluate VLMs' simulation capabilities in interpreting images. 
- VLMs tend to infer beyond specified vision abilities when given minimal prompts, resulting in low agreement with participants' responses. 
- Providing a combination of vision information and example image responses significantly increases agreement between VLM-generated responses and participants' answers. 
- Combining open-ended and multiple-choice responses offers significant performance improvements over either type alone, while additional examples provide minimal benefits. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant, varying the included information on vision information and example image responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants' responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

Summary: 
Construction safety inspections traditionally rely on human inspectors to identify safety concerns on-site. The use of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is being explored for tasks like detecting safety rule violations in on-site images, but there is a lack of open datasets for comprehensive evaluation. The ConstructionSite 10k dataset, comprising 10,000 construction site images, addresses this gap by providing annotations for tasks including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs show promising generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings but require additional training for practical application in construction sites. The ConstructionSite 10k dataset serves as a benchmark for researchers to train and evaluate VLMs with new architectures and techniques, enhancing the field of construction safety inspection. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets, limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques, providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Summary: This study explores the effectiveness of various state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models in detecting fraudulent documents. The models were tested on a standard dataset containing real transactional documents, evaluating their ability to identify indicators of fraud such as tampered text and inconsistent formatting. The results showed that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrated superior zero-shot generalization, surpassing conventional methods on out-of-distribution datasets. Vision LLMs, however, exhibited inconsistent or subpar performance. The study also found that the size of the model and advanced reasoning capabilities did not necessarily correlate with detection accuracy, highlighting the importance of task-specific fine-tuning. This research suggests that multi-modal LLMs have the potential to enhance document fraud detection systems and provides a basis for future investigations into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models (LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus, Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text, misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance. Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

- Universal medical image segmentation models are promising but face challenges due to limited and heterogeneous data.
- MedSAMix is proposed as a training-free model merging method to combine generalist and specialist models for improved performance.
- Zero-order optimization is used to automatically discover optimal layer-wise merging solutions, avoiding manual configuration.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37% on multi-task evaluations.

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

<div> Keywords: BMI, type 2 diabetes, body composition, abdominal patterns, clinical imaging

Summary:
- Elevated BMI is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, but the disease can also occur in lean individuals and be absent in some with obesity.
- Detailed body composition analysis can reveal abdominal phenotypes related to type 2 diabetes risk.
- AI can extract size, shape, and fat content measurements from 3D abdominal imaging to define body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk using large clinical data.
- Study found shared type 2 diabetes signatures across different weight classes, including factors like fatty skeletal muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or fat-laden pancreas.
- Univariate logistic regression confirmed the importance of top predictors in each subgroup, supporting the consistency of abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes across weight classes.

<br /><br />Summary: 
Elevated BMI increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, but the disease can manifest in lean individuals as well. Analyzing detailed body composition through AI-enabled 3D imaging can unveil abdominal patterns associated with type 2 diabetes risk. The study identified common signatures across different weight classes, such as fatty skeletal muscle, older age, higher visceral and subcutaneous fat levels, and pancreatic characteristics. Univariate logistic regression reaffirmed the significance of top predictors within each subgroup, indicating consistent abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes regardless of weight categories. <div>
arXiv:2508.11063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese (n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns (clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences (classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74. There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of 14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be consistent across weight classes.

Summary: 
HierOctFusion addresses the challenges of 3D content generation by introducing a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model. It leverages hierarchical feature interaction and a cross-attention conditioning mechanism to enhance the generation of fine-grained and sparse object structures. By considering semantic part hierarchies and enabling effective propagation of part-level information during the generation process, HierOctFusion significantly improves shape quality and efficiency compared to existing methods. The proposed model utilizes a 3D dataset with part category annotations to facilitate training and evaluation, showcasing superior performance in generating realistic 3D objects. By incorporating part-awareness and leveraging hierarchical features, HierOctFusion demonstrates advancements in the generation of complex 3D structures efficiently and effectively. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.11106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion, a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole. Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and efficiency compared to prior methods.

Summary: 
The article introduces a residual-based efficient bidirectional diffusion model (RBDM) that can translate between hazy and haze-free images. This model uses dual Markov chains to shift residuals and enable smooth transitions between haze-free and hazy images. By perturbing the images at individual timesteps and predicting noise in the data, the model learns conditional distributions for both dehazing and haze generation. To improve performance on small datasets and reduce computational costs, the method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches. The RBDM can implement bidirectional transitions with just 15 sampling steps and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images, lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC). Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics, guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical applications.

Abstract: LEARN is a layout-aware diffusion framework designed to generate pedagogically aligned illustrations for STEM education. It leverages a curated BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues, enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the first generative approach to unify layout-based storytelling, semantic structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released to facilitate future research and practical deployment.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new semi-supervised image dehazing method called EM-B3DM that aims to improve the dehazing of real-world images with thick haze. The method utilizes the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to separate the joint distribution of paired hazy and clear images into conditional distributions, which are then modeled using a Bidirectional Brownian Bridge diffusion model. In a two-stage learning scheme, a pre-trained model and unpaired hazy and clear images are leveraged to enhance dehazing performance. Additionally, a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution block is introduced to capture gradient-level information and improve representation capability. Experimental results demonstrate that EM-B3DM outperforms or matches the performance of state-of-the-art dehazing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty, especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing. Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Summary: 
The study introduces a Vision foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR) for Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) in remote sensing images. It leverages a small amount of labeled target data and incorporates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) to improve the detector's feature-extraction capability and mitigate noisy pseudo-labels. A VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy and a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method are proposed to enhance the quality of pseudo-labels and align detector features with VFM embeddings at instance and image levels. The approach effectively addresses training collapse issues caused by noisy pseudo-labels and complex backgrounds in remote sensing imagery, leading to superior performance in source-free remote sensing detection tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner, leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed, which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

Summary:
IOVQA is a novel fine-tuning approach designed to improve vision language models' performance in video quality assessment tasks. The method focuses on precise label construction and targeted loss calculation to enhance model accuracy and consistency. By using integer labels within a specific range and implementing a target-mask strategy during loss calculation, IOVQA ensures numerical stability and forces the model to learn critical components of video evaluation. Experimental results show that fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL model using IOVQA significantly improves accuracy, leading to a 3rd place ranking in the VQualA 2025 GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge Track I. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of leaving integer labels during fine-tuning for optimizing vision language models in quantitative evaluation scenarios.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability, and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025 GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative evaluation scenarios.

Summary: 
The proposed method, IDOD, addresses the challenges of continuous category discovery by focusing on independent enrichment of diversity, joint discovery of novelty, and continuous increment by orthogonality. It avoids the contradiction between novel class discovery and classification by training the backbone separately using contrastive loss and reducing error accumulation through single-stage novel class discovery. The orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead via representative representation replay. Experimental results demonstrate that IDOD outperforms existing methods on challenging fine-grained datasets. <div>
arXiv:2508.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module, and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment, the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact. Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

<div> adapter-based approaches, few-shot learning, vision-language models, hyperbolic learning, downstream tasks 
Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach called Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. Unlike existing adapters, LatHAdapter utilizes the latent semantic hierarchy of training data to better align categories and images. By incorporating learnable attribute prompts and leveraging hyperbolic space projections with hierarchical regularization, LatHAdapter captures one-to-many associations between categories, attributes, and images. Experimental results on challenging few-shot tasks demonstrate that LatHAdapter outperforms other fine-tuning methods, especially in adapting known classes and generalizing to unknown classes. <div>
arXiv:2508.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category) textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category) textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process. Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories, attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

Summary:
The Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT) is introduced as a video tokenizer that utilizes a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting approach to improve spatial adaptability and generalization by allocating rendering weights based on information content. It incorporates the Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Embedding mechanism for representing latent features with 2D Gaussians. GVT also employs a Gaussian Set Partitioning strategy to separate static and dynamic content, enhancing temporal versatility and compact representation. Evaluation on video reconstruction, action recognition, and compression tasks shows that GVT achieves state-of-the-art quality in reconstruction, outperforms baseline models in action recognition, and performs comparably in compression. <div>
arXiv:2508.11183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp., lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction, while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality, outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers comparable compression performance.

<div> camera height, monocular 3D object detection, depth estimation, data augmentation, generalization 

Summary:<br />
This paper addresses the issue of monocular 3D object detectors struggling with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. The study examines the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art Mono3D models using the CARLA dataset. It is found that depth estimation plays a crucial role in performance under height variations. The research reveals consistent trends in mean depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models when camera height changes. To address this challenge, a novel approach called CHARM3R is proposed, which averages depth estimates within the model. CHARM3R significantly enhances the generalization to unseen camera heights, improving performance by over 45% and achieving state-of-the-art results on the CARLA dataset. The codes and models for CHARM3R are available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art (SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than $45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at https://github.com/abhi1kumar/CHARM3R

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car maintenance require expert knowledge, especially when tasks are complex and multi-step. Despite growing interest in AI agents, there is a scarcity of dialogue-video datasets grounded for real world task assistance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person instructional videos into task-guidance two-person dialogues, aligned with fine grained steps and video-clips. Our fully automatic approach, powered by large language models, offers an efficient alternative to the substantial cost and effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636 question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable device. We establish the baseline benchmark performance on HowToDIV dataset through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for procedural-task assistance.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

<div> Knowledge Distillation, Human Pose Estimation, Coarse-to-Fine, Two-Stage, Graph Convolutional Network

Summary:
Our proposed method addresses the challenge of lightweight yet accurate human pose estimation by introducing a two-stage knowledge distillation framework. The first stage incorporates a human joints structure loss to capture contextual information among human joints and transfer high-level semantic knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. In the second stage, an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) refines the initial pose prediction and is trained progressively with guidance from the final output pose of the teacher model. Experimental results on COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly excelling on the more complex CrowdPose dataset. Our method showcases significant improvements in human pose estimation accuracy while maintaining efficiency. 

<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) to address challenges in pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios. The framework integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner to handle uncertain or missing input modalities efficiently. By leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment ability, UMM can fuse multimodal inputs effectively without extensive finetuning, providing robustness and generalization. The framework offers a lightweight solution for pedestrian re-identification, enhancing computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches. While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Summary: <br />
Recent advancements in audio-driven portrait animation have shown promising results, but challenges remain in aligning with various human preferences like motion naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. To address this, the researchers introduce Talking-Critic, a model that learns human-aligned reward functions to quantify video satisfaction across multiple dimensions. They also create a large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset called Talking-NSQ and develop the TLPO framework. TLPO decouples preferences into expert modules, which are then fused for comprehensive enhancement without interference. The Talking-Critic model surpasses existing methods in aligning with human preference ratings, while TLPO significantly improves lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and visual quality in portrait animation models. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

<div> Keywords: Dense visual perception, Vision-Language Models, DeCLIP, spatial consistency, open-vocabulary tasks

Summary: <br /><br /> This article introduces DeCLIP, a framework designed to improve dense visual perception tasks by enhancing CLIP with decoupled self-attention modules that generate "content" and "context" features. The context features of DeCLIP incorporate semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity cues from diffusion models, enhancing spatial consistency. Meanwhile, the content features are aligned with image crop representations and constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability. Through extensive experiments, DeCLIP has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various tasks such as 2D detection and segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D object pose estimation. The framework provides a solid foundation for open-vocabulary dense perception tasks, addressing limitations of existing models in aggregating information effectively from spatially or semantically related regions.

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel, the content features are aligned with image crop representations and constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D object pose estimation.} Code is available at https://github.com/xiaomoguhz/DeCLIP

Summary:
- The study investigates gender-linked associations in a vision-language model that aligns image and text representations.
- A dataset of face images and statements describing various occupations and activities is used to compute embeddings and association scores.
- Association scores measure the proximity of face embeddings to statements related to different gender stereotypes.
- Bootstrap confidence intervals and a label-swap null model are employed to assess the presence of gender biases in the model.
- The study provides a detailed analysis of gender associations across different categories and statements, along with a robust evaluation framework for gender bias in vision-language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation framework.

Category-level Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to capture fine-grained geometric properties of point cloud features and integrate them with semantic learning. Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is introduced to align category-level geometric embeddings and enhance the model's focus on geometric invariant information.

arXiv:2508.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly, Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

The article introduces a novel framework, PMTFR, for Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) tasks, addressing challenges in understanding reference images and textual instructions for target image retrieval. The framework incorporates the Pyramid Matching Model and a Training-Free Refinement module called Pyramid Patcher to enhance visual information understanding. By leveraging representation engineering inspired by Chain-of-Thought techniques, refined retrieval scores are obtained without explicit textual reasoning, improving performance in supervised CIR tasks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work, we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities. Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

Summary:  
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are typically used with language models to interpret hidden states, but their potential in the visual domain is not well-studied. This work extensively evaluates the effectiveness of SAEs in vision models across various tasks. The experimental results show that SAE features are meaningful semantically, enhance out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation in different vision model architectures. In vision embedding models, SAE features aid in out-of-distribution detection and capture the ontological structure. For diffusion models, SAEs enable semantic manipulation through text encoders and facilitate the discovery of human-interpretable attributes. Moreover, in multi-modal language models, SAE features uncover shared representations between vision and language modalities. Overall, this study underscores the potential of SAEs in enhancing interpretability, generalization, and steerability in visual tasks.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.

Summary:
Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction are crucial for improving minimally invasive surgical procedures. This article presents a unified framework that addresses challenges such as depth ambiguity, tissue deformation, endoscope motion, texture fidelity, and field of view limitations. The framework integrates scale-aware depth prediction and temporally-constrained perceptual refinement, leveraging modules like MAPIS-Depth and WEMA-RTDL for robust depth estimates and accurate registration of synthesized frames. By combining algorithms like Depth Pro, Depth Anything, RAFT, and L-BFGS-B optimization, the framework produces high-quality 3D surface meshes. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED datasets show the framework's superior performance compared to existing methods. Overall, the proposed framework shows promise in enhancing the accuracy and spatial awareness of monocular endoscopic procedures.

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges, including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED, with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Diffusion-based framework, facial image editing, age editing, identity preservation, TimeMachine<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces TimeMachine, a diffusion-based framework for precise age editing in facial images while maintaining identity features. By incorporating high-precision age information into a multi-cross attention module, the model disentangles age-related and identity-related features for accurate age manipulation. The Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module predicts age directly in the latent space, enhancing editing accuracy without significant increase in training cost. Additionally, a new High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset (HFFA) is introduced to address the lack of large-scale facial age datasets. Experimental results show that TimeMachine achieves superior performance in fine-grained age editing while ensuring consistency in personal identity. <div>

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset (High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM). Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25% F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical automotive applications.

<title>Denoise-then-Retrieve: Text-Conditioned Video Denoising for Video Moment Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF) modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore, our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

<title>Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11317</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.

<title>Delving into Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency for Robust 3D Multi-Object Tracking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11323</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets, respectively.

<title>Noise Matters: Optimizing Matching Noise for Diffusion Classifiers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11330</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11330</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising effects with different category conditions to classify categories. Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles, we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good) noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of NoOp.

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60% (2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias. Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent, scalable bias evaluation.

<title>Index-Aligned Query Distillation for Transformer-based Incremental Object Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task, Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell classification.

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability, reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs, further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art, segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets. Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification, domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code is available at: [link to be added after the paper is accepted]

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite {kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models for complex tubular structures.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices. Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions, Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy, thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations. Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information. Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution. This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including 3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input modalities.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric turbulence suppression tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels. Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training, introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly available at https: //github.com/Kainmueller-Lab/self_adapt.

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes, especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face, fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT, and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii) capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition. Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at huggingface.co/datasets/simkoc/Remove360.

<title>MM-R1: Unleashing the Power of Unified Multimodal Large Language Models for Personalized Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1) grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning, includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the correct next direction towards different specific target destinations. Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and code available along with visual demos on our project site

<title>CoFi: A Fast Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot Pipeline for Glomerular Basement Membrane Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning, which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at: https://github.com/ddrrnn123/CoFi.

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD) dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves 91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its progress.

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos, and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However, despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms, yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period. These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv) downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction, supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable, largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing baselines across all criteria.

Abstract: Detailed data is required to quantify energy conservation measures in buildings, such as envelop retrofits, without compromising cultural heritage. Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional inventories. In this study, the large language model GPT was used to detect various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this data and building register data as features, machine learning models were trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm, Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT, and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

<title>Perception in Plan: Coupled Perception and Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR performance for historical manuscripts.

<title>AIM: Amending Inherent Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking</title>

arXiv:2508.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet, and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2) Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization. Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3% precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical engineering value.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG) and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD) design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction capability and classification performance while reducing computational complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module, termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead. Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance. Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs, exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging analysis models.

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models (LVLMs) to encode object semantics into  tokens for mask prediction. However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding, yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &amp;F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &amp;F in ReasonVOS), while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model weights will be available at Veason-R1.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However, these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement (CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV.

<title>Causality Matters: How Temporal Information Emerges in Video Language Models</title>

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention, which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained 2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment, we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality, 3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior methods.

<title>Controlling Multimodal LLMs via Reward-guided Decoding</title>

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.

<title>LoRAtorio: An intrinsic approach to LoRA Skill Composition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11624</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario, which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening. We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment, abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%), calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0% malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with mammography VQA tasks.

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept, recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and computational operations via executable code. This approach not only facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping, rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations, all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy: an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation, followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20 benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains, particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Prevalent knee osteoarthritis (OA) imposes substantial burden on health systems with no cure available. Its ultimate treatment is total knee replacement (TKR). Complications from surgery and recovery are difficult to predict in advance, and numerous factors may affect them. Radiographic knee alignment is one of the key factors that impacts TKR outcomes, affecting outcomes such as postoperative pain or function. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced to the automatic analysis of knee radiographs, for example, to automate knee alignment measurements. Existing review articles tend to focus on knee OA diagnosis and segmentation of bones or cartilages in MRI rather than exploring knee alignment biomarkers for TKR outcomes and their assessment. In this review, we first examine the current scoring protocols for evaluating TKR outcomes and potential knee alignment biomarkers associated with these outcomes. We then discuss existing AI-based approaches for generating knee alignment biomarkers from knee radiographs, and explore future directions for knee alignment assessment and TKR outcome prediction.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are increasingly deployed on numerous critical applications, where users rely on auto-generated summaries while casually skimming the video stream. We show that this interaction hides a critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws: (1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3) encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain? Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&amp;C, which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The core of M&amp;C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&amp;C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines. Our results show that M&amp;C successfully predicts the best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model for the rest.

Abstract: Uterine fibroids (myomas) are the most common benign tumors of the female reproductive system, particularly among women of childbearing age. With a prevalence exceeding 70%, they pose a significant burden on female reproductive health. Clinical symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, pelvic pain, and pressure-related discomfort play a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions, which are largely influenced by the size, number, and anatomical location of the fibroids. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a precise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including measurements of volume, shape, and spatial location. However, this process is labor intensive and time consuming and subjected to variability due to intra- and inter-expert differences at both pre- and post-treatment stages. As a result, there is a critical need for an accurate and automated segmentation method for uterine fibroids. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have shown re-markable improvements in medical image segmentation, outperforming traditional methods. These approaches offer the potential for fully automated segmentation. Several studies have explored the use of deep learning models to achieve automated segmentation of uterine fibroids. However, most of the previous work has been conducted using private datasets, which poses challenges for validation and comparison between studies. In this study, we leverage the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset (UMD) to establish a baseline for automated segmentation of uterine fibroids, enabling standardized evaluation and facilitating future research in this domain.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that video generation models can enhance robot learning by deriving effective robot actions through inverse dynamics. However, these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate that GenFlowRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance across diverse and challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and temporally synchronized audio from video content is essential for video editing and post-production tasks, enabling the creation of semantically aligned audio for silent videos. However, most existing approaches focus on short-form audio generation for video segments under 10 seconds or rely on noisy datasets for long-form video-to-audio zsynthesis. To address these limitations, we introduce LD-LAudio-V1, an extension of state-of-the-art video-to-audio models and it incorporates dual lightweight adapters to enable long-form audio generation. In addition, we release a clean and human-annotated video-to-audio dataset that contains pure sound effects without noise or artifacts. Our method significantly reduces splicing artifacts and temporal inconsistencies while maintaining computational efficiency. Compared to direct fine-tuning with short training videos, LD-LAudio-V1 achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics: $FD_{\text{passt}}$ 450.00 $\rightarrow$ 327.29 (+27.27%), $FD_{\text{panns}}$ 34.88 $\rightarrow$ 22.68 (+34.98%), $FD_{\text{vgg}}$ 3.75 $\rightarrow$ 1.28 (+65.87%), $KL_{\text{panns}}$ 2.49 $\rightarrow$ 2.07 (+16.87%), $KL_{\text{passt}}$ 1.78 $\rightarrow$ 1.53 (+14.04%), $IS_{\text{panns}}$ 4.17 $\rightarrow$ 4.30 (+3.12%), $IB_{\text{score}}$ 0.25 $\rightarrow$ 0.28 (+12.00%), $Energy\Delta10\text{ms}$ 0.3013 $\rightarrow$ 0.1349 (+55.23%), $Energy\Delta10\text{ms(vs.GT)}$ 0.0531 $\rightarrow$ 0.0288 (+45.76%), and $Sem.\,Rel.$ 2.73 $\rightarrow$ 3.28 (+20.15%).

Abstract: Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.

Abstract: We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability. The code and videos are available at [kwanyun.github.io/stylemm_page](kwanyun.github.io/stylemm_page).

<title>Efficient Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge for CT Field of View Extension</title>

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a cornerstone imaging modality for non-invasive, high-resolution visualization of internal anatomical structures. However, when the scanned object exceeds the scanner's field of view (FOV), projection data are truncated, resulting in incomplete reconstructions and pronounced artifacts near FOV boundaries. Conventional reconstruction algorithms struggle to recover accurate anatomy from such data, limiting clinical reliability. Deep learning approaches have been explored for FOV extension, with diffusion generative models representing the latest advances in image synthesis. Yet, conventional diffusion models are computationally demanding and slow at inference due to their iterative sampling process. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient CT FOV extension framework based on the image-to-image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) diffusion model. Unlike traditional diffusion models that synthesize images from pure Gaussian noise, I$^2$SB learns a direct stochastic mapping between paired limited-FOV and extended-FOV images. This direct correspondence yields a more interpretable and traceable generative process, enhancing anatomical consistency and structural fidelity in reconstructions. I$^2$SB achieves superior quantitative performance, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 49.8\,HU on simulated noisy data and 152.0HU on real data, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models such as conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (cDDPM) and patch-based diffusion methods. Moreover, its one-step inference enables reconstruction in just 0.19s per 2D slice, representing over a 700-fold speedup compared to cDDPM (135s) and surpassing diffusionGAN (0.58s), the second fastest. This combination of accuracy and efficiency makes I$^2$SB highly suitable for real-time or clinical deployment.

Abstract: Blood flow imaging provides important information for hemodynamic behavior within the vascular system and plays an essential role in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow images that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or device-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity field, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed noisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field from noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims to infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping that deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an alternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field and the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality reconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through experiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under varying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic geometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to assess the influence of key hyperparameters.

<title>Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware Spatiotemporal Fusion of Satellite Images</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework for satellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF). ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization function that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC, and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and outperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high performance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to enhance reproducibility and practical utility.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling, treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation for building robust spiking models.

Abstract: When humans perform everyday tasks, we naturally adjust our actions based on the current state of the environment. For instance, if we intend to put something into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However, many autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow pre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene, which can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and eventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and spatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving task success and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce a new Multi-Agent System (MAS) - Allen, designed to address two core challenges in current MAS design: (1) improve system's policy autonomy, empowering agents to dynamically adapt their behavioral strategies, and (2) achieving the trade-off between collaborative efficiency, task supervision, and human oversight in complex network topologies.
  Our core insight is to redefine the basic execution unit in the MAS, allowing agents to autonomously form different patterns by combining these units. We have constructed a four-tier state architecture (Task, Stage, Agent, Step) to constrain system behavior from both task-oriented and execution-oriented perspectives. This achieves a unification of topological optimization and controllable progress.
  Allen grants unprecedented Policy Autonomy, while making a trade-off for the controllability of the collaborative structure. The project code has been open source at: https://github.com/motern88/Allen

Abstract: Compression at low bitrates in modern codecs often introduces banding artifacts, especially in smooth regions such as skies. These artifacts degrade visual quality and are common in user-generated content due to repeated transcoding. We propose a banding restoration method that employs the Wavelet State Space Model and a frequency masking map to preserve high-frequency details. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark of open-source banding restoration methods and evaluate their performance on two public banding image datasets. Experimentation on the available datasets suggests that the proposed post-processing approach effectively suppresses banding compared to the state-of-the-art method (a DBI value of 0.082 on BAND-2k) while preserving image textures. Visual inspections of the results confirm this. Code and supplementary material are available at: https://github.com/xinyiW915/Debanding-PCS2025.

Abstract: Medical semantic-mask synthesis boosts data augmentation and analysis, yet most GAN-based approaches still produce one-to-one images and lack spatial consistency in complex scans. To address this, we propose AnatoMaskGAN, a novel synthesis framework that embeds slice-related spatial features to precisely aggregate inter-slice contextual dependencies, introduces diverse image-augmentation strategies, and optimizes deep feature learning to improve performance on complex medical images. Specifically, we design a GNN-based strongly correlated slice-feature fusion module to model spatial relationships between slices and integrate contextual information from neighboring slices, thereby capturing anatomical details more comprehensively; we introduce a three-dimensional spatial noise-injection strategy that weights and fuses spatial features with noise to enhance modeling of structural diversity; and we incorporate a grayscale-texture classifier to optimize grayscale distribution and texture representation during generation. Extensive experiments on the public L2R-OASIS and L2R-Abdomen CT datasets show that AnatoMaskGAN raises PSNR on L2R-OASIS to 26.50 dB (0.43 dB higher than the current state of the art) and achieves an SSIM of 0.8602 on L2R-Abdomen CT--a 0.48 percentage-point gain over the best model, demonstrating its superiority in reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality. Ablation studies that successively remove the slice-feature fusion module, spatial 3D noise-injection strategy, and grayscale-texture classifier reveal that each component contributes significantly to PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, further confirming the independent value of each core design in enhancing reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are more broadly applicable to different input types.

Abstract: The success of self-attention (SA) in Transformer demonstrates the importance of non-local information to image super-resolution (SR), but the huge computing power required makes it difficult to implement lightweight models. To solve this problem, we propose a pure convolutional neural network (CNN) model, LKFMixer, which utilizes large convolutional kernel to simulate the ability of self-attention to capture non-local features. Specifically, we increase the kernel size to 31 to obtain the larger receptive field as possible, and reduce the parameters and computations by coordinate decomposition. Meanwhile, a spatial feature modulation block (SFMB) is designed to enhance the focus of feature information on both spatial and channel dimension. In addition, by introducing feature selection block (FSB), the model can adaptively adjust the weights between local features and non-local features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LKFMixer family outperform other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of SR performance and reconstruction quality. In particular, compared with SwinIR-light on Manga109 dataset, LKFMixer-L achieves 0.6dB PSNR improvement at $\times$4 scale, while the inference speed is $\times$5 times faster. The code is available at https://github.com/Supereeeee/LKFMixer.

Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

Abstract: Subcortical segmentation in neuroimages plays an important role in understanding brain anatomy and facilitating computer-aided diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries and neurodegenerative disorders. However, training accurate automatic models requires large amounts of labelled data. Despite the availability of publicly available subcortical segmentation datasets for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a significant gap exists for Computed Tomography (CT). This paper proposes an automatic ensemble framework to generate high-quality subcortical segmentation labels for CT scans by leveraging existing MRI-based models. We introduce a robust ensembling pipeline to integrate them and apply it to unannotated paired MRI-CT data, resulting in a comprehensive CT subcortical segmentation dataset. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework. Furthermore, using our generated CT dataset, we train segmentation models that achieve improved performance on related segmentation tasks. To facilitate future research, we make our source code, generated dataset, and trained models publicly available at https://github.com/SCSE-Biomedical-Computing-Group/CT-Subcortical-Segmentation, marking the first open-source release for CT subcortical segmentation to the best of our knowledge.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at aligning generated images with textual prompts, controlling the visual style of the output remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose Style-Prompting Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation. SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple, robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Rumbling281441/SPG.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Deep Learning has emerged as a promising approach for skin lesion analysis. However, existing methods mostly rely on fully supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled data, which is challenging and costly to obtain. To alleviate this annotation burden, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised deep learning approach that integrates ensemble learning with online knowledge distillation for enhanced skin lesion classification. Our methodology involves training an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online knowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members. This process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble, thereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself. Post-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test time, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the ensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual model performs better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on both the \emph{International Skin Imaging Collaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing current state-of-the-art results. By leveraging ensemble learning and online knowledge distillation, our method reduces the need for extensive labeled data while providing a more resource-efficient solution for skin lesion classification in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.

Abstract: Predicting human scanpaths when exploring panoramic videos is a challenging task due to the spherical geometry and the multimodality of the input, and the inherent uncertainty and diversity of the output. Most previous methods fail to give a complete treatment of these characteristics, and thus are prone to errors. In this paper, we present a simple new criterion for scanpath prediction based on principles from lossy data compression. This criterion suggests minimizing the expected code length of quantized scanpaths in a training set, which corresponds to fitting a discrete conditional probability model via maximum likelihood. Specifically, the probability model is conditioned on two modalities: a viewport sequence as the deformation-reduced visual input and a set of relative historical scanpaths projected onto respective viewports as the aligned path input. The probability model is parameterized by a product of discretized Gaussian mixture models to capture the uncertainty and the diversity of scanpaths from different users. Most importantly, the training of the probability model does not rely on the specification of "ground-truth" scanpaths for imitation learning. We also introduce a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller-based sampler to generate realistic human-like scanpaths from the learned probability model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently produces better quantitative scanpath results in terms of prediction accuracy (by comparing to the assumed "ground-truths") and perceptual realism (through machine discrimination) over a wide range of prediction horizons. We additionally verify the perceptual realism improvement via a formal psychophysical experiment and the generalization improvement on several unseen panoramic video datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) focuses on identifying various attributes in pedestrian images, with key applications in person retrieval, suspect re-identification, and soft biometrics. However, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for PAR often suffer from over-parameterization and high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. Traditional tensor-based compression methods typically factorize layers without adequately preserving the gradient direction during compression, leading to inefficient compression and a significant accuracy loss. In this work, we propose a novel approach for determining the optimal ranks of low-rank layers, ensuring that the gradient direction of the compressed model closely aligns with that of the original model. This means that the compressed model effectively preserves the update direction of the full model, enabling more efficient compression for PAR tasks. The proposed procedure optimizes the compression ranks for each layer within the ALM model, followed by compression using CPD-EPC or truncated SVD. This results in a reduction in model complexity while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by leveraging known primitives (state and object) during training. However, effectively modeling interactions between primitives and generalizing knowledge to novel compositions remains a perennial challenge. There are two key factors: object-conditioned and state-conditioned variance, i.e., the appearance of states (or objects) can vary significantly when combined with different objects (or states). For instance, the state "old" can signify a vintage design for a "car" or an advanced age for a "cat". In this paper, we argue that these variances can be mitigated by predicting composition categories based on pre-observed primitive. To this end, we propose Progressive Language-based Observations (PLO), which can dynamically determine a better observation order of primitives. These observations comprise a series of concepts or languages that allow the model to understand image content in a step-by-step manner. Specifically, PLO adopts pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to empower the model with observation capabilities. We further devise two variants: 1) PLO-VLM: a two-step method, where a pre-observing classifier dynamically determines the observation order of two primitives. 2) PLO-LLM: a multi-step scheme, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to craft composition-specific prompts for step-by-step observing. Extensive ablations on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of PLO compared with state-of-the-art methods, affirming its abilities in compositional recognition.

Abstract: Rendering the visual appearance of moving humans from occluded monocular videos is a challenging task. Most existing research renders 3D humans under ideal conditions, requiring a clear and unobstructed scene. Those methods cannot be used to render humans in real-world scenes where obstacles may block the camera's view and lead to partial occlusions. In this work, we present Wild2Avatar, a neural rendering approach catered for occluded in-the-wild monocular videos. We propose occlusion-aware scene parameterization for decoupling the scene into three parts - occlusion, human, and background. Additionally, extensive objective functions are designed to help enforce the decoupling of the human from both the occlusion and the background and to ensure the completeness of the human model. We verify the effectiveness of our approach with experiments on in-the-wild videos.

Abstract: Message hiding, a technique that conceals secret message bits within a cover image, aims to achieve an optimal balance among message capacity, recovery accuracy, and imperceptibility. While convolutional neural networks have notably improved message capacity and imperceptibility, achieving high recovery accuracy remains challenging. This challenge arises because convolutional operations struggle to preserve the sequential order of message bits and effectively address the discrepancy between these two modalities. To address this, we propose StegaFormer, an innovative MLP-based framework designed to preserve bit order and enable global fusion between modalities. Specifically, StegaFormer incorporates three crucial components: Order-Preserving Message Encoder (OPME), Decoder (OPMD) and Global Message-Image Fusion (GMIF). OPME and OPMD aim to preserve the order of message bits by segmenting the entire sequence into equal-length segments and incorporating sequential information during encoding and decoding. Meanwhile, GMIF employs a cross-modality fusion mechanism to effectively fuse the features from the two uncorrelated modalities. Experimental results on the COCO and DIV2K datasets demonstrate that StegaFormer surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of recovery accuracy, message capacity, and imperceptibility. We will make our code publicly available.

Abstract: Monitoring space objects is crucial for space situational awareness, yet reconstructing 3D satellite models from ground-based telescope images is challenging due to atmospheric turbulence, long observation distances, limited viewpoints, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a novel computational imaging framework that overcomes these obstacles by integrating a hybrid image pre-processing pipeline with a joint pose estimation and 3D reconstruction module based on controlled Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search. We validate our approach on both synthetic satellite datasets and on-sky observations of China's Tiangong Space Station and the International Space Station, achieving robust 3D reconstructions of low-Earth orbit satellites from ground-based data. Quantitative evaluations using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and Chamfer Distance demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches, and ablation studies confirm the critical role of each component. Our framework enables high-fidelity 3D satellite monitoring from Earth, offering a cost-effective alternative for space situational awareness.

Abstract: The significant advancements in embodied vision navigation have raised concerns about its susceptibility to adversarial attacks exploiting deep neural networks. Investigating the adversarial robustness of embodied vision navigation is crucial, especially given the threat of 3D physical attacks that could pose risks to human safety. However, existing attack methods for embodied vision navigation often lack physical feasibility due to challenges in transferring digital perturbations into the physical world. Moreover, current physical attacks for object detection struggle to achieve both multi-view effectiveness and visual naturalness in navigation scenarios. To address this, we propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching adversarial patches to objects, where both opacity and textures are learnable. Specifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a multi-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which optimizes the patch's texture based on feedback from the vision-based perception model used in navigation. To make the patch inconspicuous to human observers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, in which opacity is fine-tuned after texture optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our adversarial patches decrease the navigation success rate by an average of 22.39%, outperforming previous methods in practicality, effectiveness, and naturalness.

<title>Efficient High-Resolution Visual Representation Learning with State Space Model for Human Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: Capturing long-range dependencies while preserving high-resolution visual representations is crucial for dense prediction tasks such as human pose estimation. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced global modeling through self-attention but suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to token count, limiting their efficiency and scalability to high-resolution inputs, especially on mobile and resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, offer an efficient alternative by combining global receptive fields with linear computational complexity, enabling scalable and resource-friendly sequence modeling. However, when applied to dense prediction tasks, existing visual SSMs face key limitations: weak spatial inductive bias, long-range forgetting from hidden state decay, and low-resolution outputs that hinder fine-grained localization. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which augments visual state space models with multi-scale convolutional operations to enhance local spatial representations and strengthen spatial inductive biases. Through architectural exploration and theoretical analysis, we incorporate deformable operation into the DVSS block, identifying it as an efficient and effective mechanism to enhance semantic aggregation and mitigate long-range forgetting via input-dependent, adaptive spatial sampling. We embed DVSS into a multi-branch high-resolution architecture to build HRVMamba, a novel model for efficient high-resolution representation learning. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation show that HRVMamba performs competitively against leading CNN-, ViT-, and SSM-based baselines.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its efficient representation and rendering of 3D scenes using continuous Gaussian primitives. However, it struggles with sparse-view inputs due to limited geometric and photometric information, causing ambiguities in depth, shape, and texture.
  we propose GBR: Generative Bundle Refinement, a method for high-fidelity Gaussian splatting and meshing using only 4-6 input views. GBR integrates a neural bundle adjustment module to enhance geometry accuracy and a generative depth refinement module to improve geometry fidelity. More specifically, the neural bundle adjustment module integrates a foundation network to produce initial 3D point maps and point matches from unposed images, followed by bundle adjustment optimization to improve multiview consistency and point cloud accuracy. The generative depth refinement module employs a diffusion-based strategy to enhance geometric details and fidelity while preserving the scale. Finally, for Gaussian splatting optimization, we propose a multimodal loss function incorporating depth and normal consistency, geometric regularization, and pseudo-view supervision, providing robust guidance under sparse-view conditions. Experiments on widely used datasets show that GBR significantly outperforms existing methods under sparse-view inputs. Additionally, GBR demonstrates the ability to reconstruct and render large-scale real-world scenes, such as the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Great Wall, with remarkable details using only 6 views.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have improved visual tracking, but most still cannot run in real time on resource-limited devices, especially for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. To achieve a better balance between performance and efficiency, we propose AVTrack, an adaptive computation tracking framework that adaptively activates transformer blocks through an Activation Module (AM), which dynamically optimizes the ViT architecture by selectively engaging relevant components. To address extreme viewpoint variations, we propose to learn view-invariant representations via mutual information (MI) maximization. In addition, we propose AVTrack-MD, an enhanced tracker incorporating a novel MI maximization-based multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework. Leveraging multiple off-the-shelf AVTrack models as teachers, we maximize the MI between their aggregated softened features and the corresponding softened feature of the student model, improving the generalization and performance of the student, especially under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments show that AVTrack-MD achieves performance comparable to AVTrack's performance while reducing model complexity and boosting average tracking speed by over 17\%.

Abstract: Cybersickness remains a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of immersive virtual reality (VR), particularly in consumer-grade environments. While prior methods rely on invasive signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) for high predictive accuracy, these approaches require specialized hardware and are impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a scalable, deployable framework for personalized cybersickness prediction leveraging only non-invasive signals readily available from commercial VR headsets, including head motion, eye tracking, and physiological responses. Our model employs a modality-specific graph neural network enhanced with a Difference Attention Module to extract temporal-spatial embeddings capturing dynamic changes across modalities. A cross-modal alignment module jointly trains the video encoder to learn personalized traits by aligning video features with sensor-derived representations. Consequently, the model accurately predicts individual cybersickness using only video input during inference. Experimental results show our model achieves 88.4\% accuracy, closely matching EEG-based approaches (89.16\%), while reducing deployment complexity. With an average inference latency of 90ms, our framework supports real-time applications, ideal for integration into consumer-grade VR platforms without compromising personalization or performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized large-scale visual modeling, yet remain underexplored in face recognition (FR) where CNNs still dominate. We identify a critical bottleneck: CNN-inspired training paradigms fail to unlock ViT's potential, leading to suboptimal performance and convergence instability.To address this challenge, we propose LVFace, a ViT-based FR model that integrates Progressive Cluster Optimization (PCO) to achieve superior results. Specifically, PCO sequentially applies negative class sub-sampling (NCS) for robust and fast feature alignment from random initialization, feature expectation penalties for centroid stabilization, performing cluster boundary refinement through full-batch training without NCS constraints. LVFace establishes a new state-of-the-art face recognition baseline, surpassing leading approaches such as UniFace and TopoFR across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LVFace delivers consistent performance gains, while exhibiting scalability to large-scale datasets and compatibility with mainstream VLMs and LLMs. Notably, LVFace secured 1st place in the ICCV 2021 Masked Face Recognition (MFR)-Ongoing Challenge (March 2025), proving its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The proliferation of Text-to-Image (T2I) models has revolutionized content creation, providing powerful tools for diverse applications ranging from artistic expression to educational material development and marketing. Despite these technological advancements, significant ethical concerns arise from these models' reliance on large-scale datasets that often contain inherent societal biases. These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is included in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes in the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel framework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social biases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an LLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in generated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module that fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate identified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and datasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining high-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and quantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space, building upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our results show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the diversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate, using the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are challenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond occupation-related prompts. On the basis of these findings, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for evaluating bias in T2I models.

<title>Introducing Unbiased Depth into 2D Gaussian Splatting for High-accuracy Surface Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Recently, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has demonstrated superior geometry reconstruction quality than the popular 3DGS by using 2D surfels to approximate thin surfaces. However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces, resulting in visible holes in these areas. We find that the reflection discontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specular reflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in the optimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depth distortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes a strong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectify the depth criterion in determining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersecting Gaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaoXinyyx/Unbiased_Surfel.

Abstract: Transparent objects are common in daily life, and understanding their multi-layer depth information -- perceiving both the transparent surface and the objects behind it -- is crucial for real-world applications that interact with transparent materials. In this paper, we introduce LayeredDepth, the first dataset with multi-layer depth annotations, including a real-world benchmark and a synthetic data generator, to support the task of multi-layer depth estimation. Our real-world benchmark consists of 1,500 images from diverse scenes, and evaluating state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on it reveals that they struggle with transparent objects. The synthetic data generator is fully procedural and capable of providing training data for this task with an unlimited variety of objects and scene compositions. Using this generator, we create a synthetic dataset with 15,300 images. Baseline models training solely on this synthetic dataset produce good cross-domain multi-layer depth estimation. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art single-layer depth models on it substantially improves their performance on transparent objects, with quadruplet accuracy on our benchmark increased from 55.14% to 75.20%. All images and validation annotations are available under CC0 at https://layereddepth.cs.princeton.edu.

Abstract: Recently, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for industrial inspection and medical diagnostics, detecting defects in novel objects without requiring any target-dataset samples during training. Existing CLIP-based ZSAD methods generate anomaly maps by measuring the cosine similarity between visual and textual features. However, CLIP's alignment with object categories instead of their anomalous states limits its effectiveness for anomaly detection. To address this limitation, we propose AFR-CLIP, a CLIP-based anomaly feature rectification framework. AFR-CLIP first performs image-guided textual rectification, embedding the implicit defect information from the image into a stateless prompt that describes the object category without indicating any anomalous state. The enriched textual embeddings are then compared with two pre-defined stateful (normal or abnormal) embeddings, and their text-on-text similarity yields the anomaly map that highlights defective regions. To further enhance perception to multi-scale features and complex anomalies, we introduce self prompting (SP) and multi-patch feature aggregation (MPFA) modules. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven anomaly detection benchmarks across industrial and medical domains, demonstrating AFR-CLIP's superiority in ZSAD.

Abstract: Medical report generation requires specialized expertise that general large models often fail to accurately capture. Moreover, the inherent repetition and similarity in medical data make it difficult for models to extract meaningful features, resulting in a tendency to overfit. So in this paper, we propose a multimodal model, Co-Attention Triple-LSTM Network (CA-TriNet), a deep learning model that combines transformer architectures with a Multi-LSTM network. Its Co-Attention module synergistically links a vision transformer with a text transformer to better differentiate medical images with similarities, augmented by an adaptive weight operator to catch and amplify image labels with minor similarities. Furthermore, its Triple-LSTM module refines generated sentences using targeted image objects. Extensive evaluations over three public datasets have demonstrated that CA-TriNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of comprehensive ability, even pre-trained large language models on some metrics.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image analysis, but extending them to 3D remains challenging due to the high computational demands of volumetric data and the difficulty of aligning 3D spatial features with clinical text. We present Med3DVLM, a 3D VLM designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) DCFormer, an efficient encoder that uses decomposed 3D convolutions to capture fine-grained spatial features at scale; (2) SigLIP, a contrastive learning strategy with pairwise sigmoid loss that improves image-text alignment without relying on large negative batches; and (3) a dual-stream MLP-Mixer projector that fuses low- and high-level image features with text embeddings for richer multi-modal representations. We evaluate our model on the M3D dataset, which includes radiology reports and VQA data for 120,084 3D medical images. Results show that Med3DVLM achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks. For image-text retrieval, it reaches 61.00% R@1 on 2,000 samples, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art M3D model (19.10%). For report generation, it achieves a METEOR score of 36.42% (vs. 14.38%). In open-ended visual question answering (VQA), it scores 36.76% METEOR (vs. 33.58%), and in closed-ended VQA, it achieves 79.95% accuracy (vs. 75.78%). These results highlight Med3DVLM's ability to bridge the gap between 3D imaging and language, enabling scalable, multi-task reasoning across clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of AI-generated images is essential for mitigating risks associated with AI misuse. However, the substantial domain gap among generative models makes it challenging to develop a generalizable forgery detection model. Moreover, since every pixel in an AI-generated image is synthesized, traditional saliency-based forgery explanation methods are not well suited for this task. To address these challenges, we formulate detection and explanation as a unified Forgery Detection and Reasoning task (FDR-Task), leveraging Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide accurate detection through reliable reasoning over forgery attributes. To facilitate this task, we introduce the Multi-Modal Forgery Reasoning dataset (MMFR-Dataset), a large-scale dataset containing 120K images across 10 generative models, with 378K reasoning annotations on forgery attributes, enabling comprehensive evaluation of the FDR-Task. Furthermore, we propose FakeReasoning, a forgery detection and reasoning framework with three key components: 1) a dual-branch visual encoder that integrates CLIP and DINO to capture both high-level semantics and low-level artifacts; 2) a Forgery-Aware Feature Fusion Module that leverages DINO's attention maps and cross-attention mechanisms to guide MLLMs toward forgery-related clues; 3) a Classification Probability Mapper that couples language modeling and forgery detection, enhancing overall performance. Experiments across multiple generative models demonstrate that FakeReasoning not only achieves robust generalization but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both detection and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has gained significant attention for its superior performance. However, most existing methods rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, limiting their ability to capture detailed scenes in high-contrast environments. While some prior works address high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, they typically require multi-view sharp images with varying exposure times captured at fixed camera positions, which is time-consuming and impractical. To make data acquisition more flexible, we propose \textbf{Casual3DHDR}, a robust one-stage method that reconstructs 3D HDR scenes from casually-captured auto-exposure (AE) videos, even under severe motion blur and unknown, varying exposure times. Our approach integrates a continuous camera trajectory into a unified physical imaging model, jointly optimizing exposure times, camera trajectory, and the camera response function (CRF). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \textbf{Casual3DHDR} outperforms existing methods in robustness and rendering quality.

Abstract: Interpreting object-referential language and grounding objects in 3D with spatial relations and attributes is essential for robots operating alongside humans. However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on two autonomous vehicles and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments. All source code for the system pipeline is publicly released at https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D.

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential solution involves employing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to construct a self-correction framework. However, these approaches heavily rely on the capabilities of the MLLMs used, often fail to account for all objects within the image, and suffer from cumulative distortions during multi-round editing processes. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting to enhance image-text alignment. First, we employ a large language model as an Object-Aware Agent to perform object-level divide-and-conquer, automatically decomposing self-correction tasks into object-centric subtasks based on image descriptions. For each subtask, we construct an Object Correction System featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism that operates exclusively on a single object's segmentation mask or the bounding boxes of object pairs, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To efficiently integrate correction results from subtasks while avoiding cumulative distortions from multi-stage editing, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother, which employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtasks, significantly improving runtime efficiency while preventing distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.

Abstract: Due to the domain gap between real-world and synthetic hazy images, current data-driven dehazing algorithms trained on synthetic datasets perform well on synthetic data but struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{I}mage \textbf{D}ehazing \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels (IDDM), a novel diffusion process that incorporates the atmospheric scattering model into noise diffusion. IDDM aims to use the gradual haze formation process to help the denoising Unet robustly learn the distribution of clear images from the conditional input hazy images. We design a specialized training strategy centered around IDDM. Diffusion models are leveraged to bridge the domain gap from synthetic to real-world, while the atmospheric scattering model provides physical guidance for haze formation. During the forward process, IDDM simultaneously introduces haze and noise into clear images, and then robustly separates them during the sampling process. By training with physics-guided information, IDDM shows the ability of domain generalization, and effectively restores the real-world hazy images despite being trained on synthetic datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the unique target described by natural languages in 3D scenes. The significant gap between 3D and language modalities makes it a notable challenge to distinguish multiple similar objects through the described spatial relationships. Current methods attempt to achieve cross-modal understanding in complex scenes via a target-centered learning mechanism, ignoring the modeling of referred objects. We propose a novel 3D visual grounding framework that constructs language-guided scene graphs with referred object discrimination to improve relational perception. The framework incorporates a dual-branch visual encoder that leverages pre-trained 2D semantics to enhance and supervise the multi-modal 3D encoding. Furthermore, we employ graph attention to promote relationship-oriented information fusion in cross-modal interaction. The learned object representations and scene graph structure enable effective alignment between 3D visual content and textual descriptions. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate our superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in handling the challenges of multiple similar distractors.

Abstract: Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.

Abstract: Recent advancements in prompt-based medical image segmentation have enabled clinicians to identify tumors using simple input like bounding boxes or text prompts. However, existing methods face challenges when doctors need to interact through natural language or when position reasoning is required - understanding spatial relationships between anatomical structures and pathologies. We present PRS-Med, a framework that integrates vision-language models with segmentation capabilities to generate both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. Additionally, we introduce the MMRS dataset (Multimodal Medical in Positional Reasoning Segmentation), which provides diverse, spatially-grounded question-answer pairs to address the lack of position reasoning data in medical imaging. PRS-Med demonstrates superior performance across six imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, endoscopy, RGB), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both segmentation accuracy and position reasoning. Our approach enables intuitive doctor-system interaction through natural language, facilitating more efficient diagnoses. Our dataset pipeline, model, and codebase will be released to foster further research in spatially-aware multimodal reasoning for medical applications.

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity, which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2) limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises 620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis, etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at https://github.com/ZMH-SDUST/PhysLab.

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a major source of injury in hospitals and long-term care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500 parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal computational and memory overhead.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. Project code and pre-processed data is available at https://github.com/JamesMcCullochDickens/Human3DParsing/tree/master.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods, whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2) a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data. Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and localization under domain shift.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing datasets. We present HateClipSeg, a large-scale multimodal dataset with both video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting, Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training. Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process, leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907 locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust "think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research. Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently, building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

Abstract: Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.

Abstract: Current deep learning-based approaches to lesion segmentation in neuroimaging often depend on high-resolution images and extensive annotated data, limiting clinical applicability. This paper introduces a novel synthetic data framework tailored for stroke lesion segmentation, expanding the SynthSeg methodology to incorporate lesion-specific augmentations that simulate diverse pathological features. Using a modified nnUNet architecture, our approach trains models with label maps from healthy and stroke datasets, facilitating segmentation across both normal and pathological tissue without reliance on specific sequence-based training. Evaluation across in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) datasets reveals that our method matches state-of-the-art performance within the training domain and significantly outperforms existing methods on OOD data. By minimizing dependence on large annotated datasets and allowing for cross-sequence applicability, our framework holds potential to improve clinical neuroimaging workflows, particularly in stroke pathology. PyTorch training code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/SynthStroke, along with an SPM toolbox featuring a plug-and-play model at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/SynthStrokeSPM.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of brain tumors in intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) images could facilitate localization of tumor tissue during resection surgery. The lack of large annotated datasets limits the current models performances. In this paper, we investigated the use of tumor annotations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are more accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated MRI scans with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training the nnU-Net model with different configurations of the data and label origins. The results showed no significant difference in Dice score for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors compared to models trained with only iUS annotations and both, and to expert annotations, indicating that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for iUS tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in iUS images. The best model obtained an average Dice score of $0.62\pm0.31$, compared to $0.67\pm0.25$ for an expert neurosurgeon, where the performance on larger tumors were similar, but lower for the models on smaller tumors. In addition, the results showed that removing smaller tumors from the training sets improved the results.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose the Dual-Group Multi-Scale Wavelet Loss, a wavelet-domain constraint mechanism via dual-group subband strategy and cross-resolution frequency alignment for enhanced reconstruction fidelity in RSI-SR. Extensive experiments under two degradation methods on several benchmarks, including AID, UCMerced, and RSSRD-QH, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.09 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 3.2 times faster.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a paradigm that augments large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge to tackle knowledge-intensive question answering. While several benchmarks evaluate Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) under Multimodal RAG settings, they predominantly retrieve from textual corpora and do not explicitly assess how models exploit visual evidence during generation. Consequently, there still lacks benchmark that isolates and measures the contribution of retrieved images in RAG. We introduce Visual-RAG, a question-answering benchmark that targets visually grounded, knowledge-intensive questions. Unlike prior work, Visual-RAG requires text-to-image retrieval and the integration of retrieved clue images to extract visual evidence for answer generation. With Visual-RAG, we evaluate 5 open-source and 3 proprietary MLLMs, showcasing that images provide strong evidence in augmented generation. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle to efficiently extract and utilize visual knowledge. Our results highlight the need for improved visual retrieval, grounding, and attribution in multimodal RAG systems.

<title>An Analytical Theory of Spectral Bias in the Learning Dynamics of Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: We develop an analytical framework for understanding how the generated distribution evolves during diffusion model training. Leveraging a Gaussian-equivalence principle, we solve the full-batch gradient-flow dynamics of linear and convolutional denoisers and integrate the resulting probability-flow ODE, yielding analytic expressions for the generated distribution. The theory exposes a universal inverse-variance spectral law: the time for an eigen- or Fourier mode to match its target variance scales as $\tau\propto\lambda^{-1}$, so high-variance (coarse) structure is mastered orders of magnitude sooner than low-variance (fine) detail. Extending the analysis to deep linear networks and circulant full-width convolutions shows that weight sharing merely multiplies learning rates accelerating but not eliminating the bias whereas local convolution introduces a qualitatively different bias. Experiments on Gaussian and natural-image datasets confirm the spectral law persists in deep MLP-based UNet. Convolutional U-Nets, however, display rapid near-simultaneous emergence of many modes, implicating local convolution in reshaping learning dynamics. These results underscore how data covariance governs the order and speed with which diffusion models learn, and they call for deeper investigation of the unique inductive biases introduced by local convolution.

<title>HealthiVert-GAN: A Novel Framework of Pseudo-Healthy Vertebral Image Synthesis for Interpretable Compression Fracture Grading</title>

Abstract: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are prevalent in the elderly population, typically assessed on computed tomography (CT) scans by evaluating vertebral height loss. This assessment helps determine the fracture's impact on spinal stability and the need for surgical intervention. However, the absence of pre-fracture CT scans and standardized vertebral references leads to measurement errors and inter-observer variability, while irregular compression patterns further challenge the precise grading of fracture severity. While deep learning methods have shown promise in aiding OVCFs screening, they often lack interpretability and sufficient sensitivity, limiting their clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel vertebra synthesis-height loss quantification-OVCFs grading framework. Our proposed model, HealthiVert-GAN, utilizes a coarse-to-fine synthesis network designed to generate pseudo-healthy vertebral images that simulate the pre-fracture state of fractured vertebrae. This model integrates three auxiliary modules that leverage the morphology and height information of adjacent healthy vertebrae to ensure anatomical consistency. Additionally, we introduce the Relative Height Loss of Vertebrae (RHLV) as a quantification metric, which divides each vertebra into three sections to measure height loss between pre-fracture and post-fracture states, followed by fracture severity classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on both the Verse2019 dataset and in-house dataset, and it provides cross-sectional distribution maps of vertebral height loss. This practical tool enhances diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings and assisting in surgical decision-making.

Abstract: Cervical spondylosis, a complex and prevalent condition, demands precise and efficient diagnostic techniques for accurate assessment. While MRI offers detailed visualization of cervical spine anatomy, manual interpretation remains labor-intensive and prone to error. To address this, we developed an innovative AI-assisted Expert-based Diagnosis System that automates both segmentation and diagnosis of cervical spondylosis using MRI. Leveraging multi-center datasets of cervical MRI images from patients with cervical spondylosis, our system features a pathology-guided segmentation model capable of accurately segmenting key cervical anatomical structures. The segmentation is followed by an expert-based diagnostic framework that automates the calculation of critical clinical indicators. Our segmentation model achieved an impressive average Dice coefficient exceeding 0.90 across four cervical spinal anatomies and demonstrated enhanced accuracy in herniation areas. Diagnostic evaluation further showcased the system's precision, with the lowest mean average errors (MAE) for the C2-C7 Cobb angle and the Maximum Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC) coefficient. In addition, our method delivered high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in herniation localization, K-line status assessment, T2 hyperintensity detection, and Kang grading. Comparative analysis and external validation demonstrate that our system outperforms existing methods, establishing a new benchmark for segmentation and diagnostic tasks for cervical spondylosis.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) providing essential diagnostic information. However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

Abstract: We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of modality collapse, a recently observed empirical phenomenon wherein models trained for multimodal fusion tend to rely only on a subset of the modalities, ignoring the rest. We show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder, denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation, with applications in dealing with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks validate our theoretical claims. Project page: https://abhrac.github.io/mmcollapse/.

<title>Omni-DPO: A Dual-Perspective Paradigm for Dynamic Preference Learning of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.

arXiv:2507.22832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ReLU networks, gradients of output units can be seen as their input-level representations, as they correspond to the units' pullbacks through the active subnetwork. However, gradients of deeper models are notoriously misaligned, significantly contributing to their black-box nature. We claim that this is because active subnetworks are inherently noisy due to the ReLU hard-gating. To tackle that noise, we propose soft-gating in the backward pass only. The resulting input-level vector field (called ''excitation pullback'') exhibits remarkable perceptual alignment, revealing high-resolution input- and target-specific features that ''just make sense'', therefore establishing a compelling novel explanation method. Furthermore, we speculate that excitation pullbacks approximate (directionally) the gradients of a simpler model, linear in the network's path space, learned implicitly during optimization and largely determining the network's decision; thus arguing for the faithfulness of the produced explanations and their overall significance.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

<div> Keywords: lipreading, temporal convolutional networks, dense skip connections, multi-dilated convolutional network, receptive field<br />
Summary:<br />
The proposed TD3Net addresses limitations in traditional word-level lipreading approaches by combining dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions in the backend architecture. This results in a wide and dense receptive field without blind spots, allowing for better modeling of complex temporal representations. Experimental results on the LRW and LRW-1000 datasets show that TD3Net achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer parameters and lower floating-point operations. The method effectively utilizes diverse temporal features while maintaining temporal continuity, showcasing significant advantages in lipreading systems. The code for TD3Net is available on the GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field, thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However, their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features. Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures. Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting notable advantages in lipreading systems. The code is available at our GitHub repository (https://github.com/Leebh-kor/TD3Net).

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces SIFThinker, a spatially-aware framework for multimodal large language models that improves complex visual tasks by incorporating attention correction with spatial cues. SIFThinker mimics human visual perception and enables image region focusing through depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. The reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy is utilized to create interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, resulting in the SIF-50K dataset. Additionally, the GRPO-SIF training paradigm integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, enhancing the model's ability to correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Experimental results demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms existing methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception while maintaining strong overall performance. The code for SIFThinker is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: few-shot learning, food images, patch filtering, similarity matrix, classification benchmarks

Summary:
SPFF is introduced to address the challenges faced by few-shot learning models when dealing with food images, which are visually complex and variable. By filtering patch embeddings stochastically based on their similarity to the class representation, SPFF focuses on patches with prominent class-specific food features while filtering out non-relevant patches. The approach uses a similarity matrix to quantify the relationship between query and support images. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like Food-101, VireoFood-172, and UECFood-256 demonstrate that SPFF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method improves few-shot learning performance by effectively attending to important elements in food images during classification tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing SoA methods.

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers have developed an interpretable method for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using Large Vision-Language Models. This approach combines radical analysis and pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings in OBS. The progressive training strategy guides the model from radical recognition to pictographic analysis, improving reasoning from glyph to meaning. A Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism enhances zero-shot decipherment performance. The newly created Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset facilitates model training with annotated Chinese characters and OBS images. Experimental results show state-of-the-art accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. The model also provides logical analysis processes, potentially offering valuable insights for undeciphered OBS in archaeological research. The dataset and code are publicly available for further research in digital humanities and historical studies. <div>
arXiv:2508.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity, abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability, especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly, our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes, then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic health markers.

Three new cross-attention mechanisms, Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA), are proposed to efficiently capture complex correlations in multimodal data. The Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow allows scalability to high-dimensional multimodal data. Experimental results on semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

<div> synthetic images, real images, GenAI models, crop disease diagnosis, classification performance <br />
<br />Summary: <br />The study evaluates the integration of real and synthetic images to improve disease classification using an EfficientNetV2-L model for watermelon diseases. The training dataset was divided into treatments with different ratios of real and synthetic images. Models trained with a combination of real and synthetic images showed high precision, recall, and F1-score, with a significant increase in weighted F1-score from 0.65 to 1.00. The results indicate that a hybrid approach combining both real and synthetic images is essential to enhance model performance and generalizability in crop disease classification. This suggests that while synthetic images have potential benefits, they cannot wholly replace real images and should be used together for optimal model accuracy. <div>

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection. However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon \textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1 real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall, this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, synthetic data generation, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, industrial spill detection, object detectors

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced in niche, safety-critical domains like industrial spill detection, where real incident data is scarce due to privacy concerns and data sensitivity. To address this, a scalable framework using synthetic data generation is introduced, allowing for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and enhancing the performance of object detectors. The study demonstrates that VLMs generalize better to unseen spill scenarios compared to detectors without synthetic data. However, when the synthetic data is utilized, both VLMs and detectors show significant improvements, making their performance comparable. The results highlight the effectiveness of high-fidelity synthetic data in bridging the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of synthetic data generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for deploying vision systems in industrial settings with limited real data availability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data (SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective, scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of 3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions, while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and decoding time.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape.

In this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with 3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning methodologies, including recent foundation models.

Summary: 
The article introduces Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method designed to address the issue of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by improving factual grounding through inter-region consistency modeling. MRFD utilizes cross-attention to identify salient regions in images, generates initial responses for each region, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) to guide a consistency-aware fusion of predictions. Region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning are used in this process. Experimental results across various LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that MRFD effectively reduces hallucinations and enhances response factuality without necessitating model updates. <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without requiring model updates.

<br />Summary: 
The study focuses on appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation, which currently requires person-specific calibration due to individual differences. However, calibrated PoG estimators are sensitive to head pose variations. A benchmark called MobilePoG was created to analyze the impact of calibration points diversity and head poses on estimation accuracy. The research found that introducing a wider range of head poses during calibration improves the estimator's pose variation handling. A dynamic calibration strategy was proposed, where users fixate on points while moving their phones, effectively reducing sensitivity to head pose variations. This user-friendly and efficient calibration process enhances the PoG estimator's performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies. Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using conventional calibration strategies.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel method for high-fidelity image generation by addressing performance bottlenecks in existing text-driven methods. The proposed approach combines text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms to improve semantic alignment accuracy and structural consistency. By integrating a contrastive learning module and utilizing structural priors such as semantic layout maps, the method enhances the spatial-level structural modeling of generated images. The model optimizes contrastive loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss using a multi-objective supervision mechanism. Experimental results on the COCO-2014 dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM metrics. The approach bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity, producing semantically clear and structurally complete images efficiently. This work provides a promising direction for joint text-image modeling and image generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling. This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

Summary:
The article focuses on developing a new framework for accurately recognizing figure skating jumps from videos. The proposed framework incorporates the three-dimensional nature and procedural structure of jump actions. It introduces a novel pose representation learning approach, VIFSS, that combines contrastive learning and action classification. A specialized 3D pose dataset, FS-Jump3D, is created for view-invariant contrastive pre-training. A fine-grained annotation scheme is introduced to mark the "entry" and "landing" phases of jumps, facilitating the learning of procedural structure. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the framework, achieving over 92% F1@50 on element-level TAS. The study also demonstrates the practicality of view-invariant contrastive pre-training when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the potential application of the approach in real-world scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating: the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning. For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps. Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry (preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Summary:
The article presents a novel phase consistency weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method to enhance the accuracy of matching multimodal optical images. By combining coarse matching using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD, the PCWLAD method mitigates the impact of nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences. The method involves calculating phase consistencies without a noise filter, applying radiometric and geometric transformation models, and utilizing mutual structure filtering to improve structural consistency. Evaluations on three types of image datasets demonstrated that PCWLAD surpassed existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR) and root mean square error (RMSE), achieving an average matching accuracy of approximately 0.4 pixels. The software and datasets for PCWLAD are publicly available for further research and development. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step, PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore, mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR) and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

<br />Summary: <br />InterSyn introduces a novel approach for motion synthesis, focusing on generating realistic interaction motions by combining solo and multi-person dynamics. The framework utilizes an interleaved learning strategy to capture dynamic interactions and coordination in real-world scenarios. It consists of two modules: the INS module models solo and interactive behaviors simultaneously, while the REC module refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronization among characters. Experimental results demonstrate that InterSyn generates motion sequences with improved alignment to text and increased diversity compared to existing methods. The framework sets a new benchmark for robust and natural motion synthesis. Additionally, the code will be open-sourced to encourage further research and development in the field. <div>

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately, InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural, dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios. Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis (INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters. Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote further research and development in this area.

Summary: 
Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation are crucial for AI security, particularly in autonomous driving applications. Conventional methods lack spatial localization of OoD objects, limiting their use in critical tasks. OoD segmentation, however, provides pixel-level localization, essential for precise control actions in autonomous driving scenarios. Current approaches include test-time segmentation, outlier exposure during training, reconstruction-based methods, and leveraging powerful models. This survey reviews recent advances in OoD segmentation for autonomous driving, highlighting challenges and future research directions. Test-time segmentation allows for real-time OoD detection, while outlier exposure improves supervised training. Reconstruction-based methods focus on reconstructing anomalous regions, and leveraging powerful models enhances segmentation accuracy. Promising research areas include improving model robustness and scalability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization, limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges, and discuss promising future research directions.

Summary: 
Generative models have advanced in creating visual content but are often trained with objectives that do not align with perceptual quality or realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a way to optimize non-differentiable objectives, leading to better controllability and human alignment. This survey explores the use of RL in visual content generation, tracing its evolution from classical control to a versatile optimization tool. RL has been successfully integrated into image, video, and 3D/4D generation, not just as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a means to align generation with high-level goals. The survey discusses the challenges and future directions in utilizing RL for generative modeling, highlighting the potential for further advancement in this field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Summary: 
Vision-language instruction tuning aims to learn visual concepts and skills simultaneously. The study reveals that vision-language benchmarks benefit either from training on similar skills or visual concepts. A targeted data selection method is introduced to optimize benchmark performance by identifying and selecting instructions with matching concepts or skills. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate a performance improvement of +0.9% over existing baselines on average and +1.5% on skill-focused subsets. The results emphasize the necessity of balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge and visual skills in instruction selection. <div>

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+ benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method, showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and +1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces the Glo-DMU framework for automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure in kidney diseases. This framework utilizes three deep learning models to quantify key ultrastructural features in renal biopsy samples: glomerular basement membrane thickness, foot process effacement degree, and electron-dense deposit location. By incorporating segmentation, classification, and detection models, Glo-DMU offers full automation, high precision, and high throughput in quantifying multiple ultrastructural characteristics simultaneously.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type, progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure. However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis, this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits. We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal pathologists.

- Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is crucial in materials science for atomic imaging and studying material evolution.<br />
- Interpreting time-resolved STEM data is challenging due to spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss.<br />
- AtomDiffuser is a framework that separates sample drift and radiometric attenuation in STEM data.<br />

arXiv:2508.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser, a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes, AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Summary:
The study focuses on assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) with human perception by estimating their contrast sensitivity function (CSF). A novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired method was introduced to prompt chat-based VLMs to judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency, closely resembling real psychophysical experiments. Using band-pass filtered noise images and various prompts, the responses of multiple model architectures were evaluated. Results showed that while some models approximated human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully replicated both. The study also highlighted the significant impact of prompt phrasing on model responses, indicating concerns about prompt stability. Overall, the findings provide a new framework for exploring visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal discrepancies between their visual representations and human perception.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses, raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between their visual representations and human perception.

<div> Image generation, intrinsic scene properties, spatial consistency, Latent Diffusion Models, denoising <br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a novel approach for image generation that incorporates intrinsic scene properties to improve spatial consistency and realism. By leveraging depth and segmentation maps to capture scene structure, the model co-generates images and intrinsics, leading to more accurate representations. Pre-trained estimators are used to extract intrinsic properties from large datasets, which are then aggregated into a latent variable via an autoencoder. The method builds upon Latent Diffusion Models to denoise both image and intrinsic domains while maintaining image quality and alignment with the base model. Experimental results demonstrate the correction of spatial inconsistencies and natural layout improvements in generated images. <div>
arXiv:2508.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

NSegment+ is a novel augmentation framework designed to address subtle label imperfections in semantic segmentation tasks. The method decouples image and label transformations, applying controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving the original images. This approach helps models learn robust representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies, leading to improved performance. Experiments on various datasets show significant gains in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), with enhancements of up to +3.39 on PASCAL VOC.

arXiv:2508.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit) label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present, such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework (PQ-DAF) for improving driver distraction detection. It addresses the few-shot learning challenge and domain shift issues by leveraging a vision-language model to filter and expand training data. The framework combines a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to capture driver pose features and a sample quality assessment module based on a vision-language model. This allows for the generation of diverse synthetic samples while ensuring their reliability through quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that PQ-DAF significantly enhances performance in few-shot driver distraction detection tasks, particularly in data-scarce conditions. The framework achieves notable improvements in model generalization, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing cross-domain robustness for driver distraction detection.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework (PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness. Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

Summary: 
Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have improved in generating images from textual prompts. Challenges still exist in suppressing content strongly associated with specific words, such as a mustache appearing when generating an image of Charlie Chaplin. A novel approach is proposed to suppress entangled content within the text embedding space of diffusion models using a delta vector. This vector weakens the influence of undesired content, obtainable through a zero-shot approach. The Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method integrates the delta vector into the cross-attention mechanism for more effective content suppression. Personalized T2I models benefit from optimized delta vectors for precise suppression. Extensive experiments show the approach outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with ``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image, and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Summary:
SC-Lane is introduced as a novel framework for 3D lane detection, incorporating slope-aware and temporally consistent techniques. It utilizes a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module to dynamically predict weights for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.

Evaluations using standardized metrics like MAE and RMSE on a LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset show the effectiveness of SC-Lane in improving height estimation and 3D lane detection.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap. Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work [20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

Summary:
Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl) is proposed for controllable text-to-image generation, using Flux as the backbone network. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal increase in parameters and computational costs. Rather than duplicating the backbone for control, a LoRA-style control module directly learns control signals from conditioning inputs. The KV-Context Augmentation mechanism integrates condition-specific key-value information into the backbone for effective feature fusion. Benchmark experiments show NanoControl reduces computational overhead while maintaining high generation quality and improved controllability compared to traditional methods. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically, rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style (low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality and achieving improved controllability.

Summary: 
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been utilized in autonomous driving scenarios, but they lack the spatiotemporal reasoning needed for dynamic traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, this study introduces STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering dataset based on ego-centric driving data in Tokyo. This dataset contains 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames, providing annotations like 3D bounding boxes and segmentation masks for object-centric and ego-centric reasoning. Existing VLMs struggle with spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, but fine-tuning them on STRIDE-QA leads to significant performance improvements, with 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction. This dataset lays the groundwork for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

<div> Keywords: video instance segmentation, continual learning, semantic prompting, contrastive learning, object tracking

Summary:
CRISP, a novel approach for continual video instance segmentation, tackles instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion by introducing Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting. For instance-wise learning, CRISP emphasizes correlation with prior queries and strengthens specificity for current tasks. Category-wise learning is addressed through an Adaptive Residual Semantic Prompt (ARSP) framework, maintaining semantic coherence during incremental training. Task-wise learning focuses on inter-task correlation within the query space. Extensive experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets show CRISP outperforms existing methods in long-term video instance segmentation, improving segmentation and classification performance while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. For those interested, the code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning, we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt. Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Summary: 
The research introduces a novel approach, DOD-SA, for infrared-visible object detection using single-modality annotations. The proposed framework, CoSD-TSNet, includes a single- and dual-modality collaborative teacher-student network that transfers knowledge between modalities. A progressive training strategy, PaST, improves model decoupling and pseudo-label quality through three stages of training. A Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) aligns labels across modalities to address modality misalignment during training. Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset show that DOD-SA outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in infrared-visible object detection. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality, simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision. To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST) that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training. Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

<div> Dataset, automated symbol spotting, object detection models, SkeySpot, interoperability<br />
Summary:<br />
Legacy floor plans in the construction industry are often preserved as scanned documents, making large-scale interpretation time-consuming and error-prone. To address this, a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans (DELP) dataset with 2,450 annotated instances across 34 service key classes is introduced. Pretrained object detection models, particularly YOLOv8, achieve high performance in detecting electrical symbols. SkeySpot, a lightweight toolkit using YOLOv8, enables real-time detection, classification, and quantification of symbols for interoperable building information workflows. This approach reduces dependency on proprietary CAD systems, lowers manual annotation effort, and makes digitisation of electrical layouts accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone. Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans (DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with 2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection, classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the built environment.

<div> Keywords: human visual perception, bio-inspired architecture, image reconstruction, neural representations, perceptual metrics

Summary:
The study explores the relationship between human visual perception and image statistics, suggesting that the visual system may have evolved to efficiently process visual information based on certain image characteristics. The PerceptNet, a bio-inspired architecture, was developed and optimized for tasks such as autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Surprisingly, the encoder stage of the PerceptNet, resembling the V1 cortex, exhibited high correlation with human perceptual judgments on image distortion without explicitly utilizing perceptual information during training. The results indicate that the visual system may be finely tuned to address specific levels of noise, blur, and sparsity. The study also demonstrates that biologically inspired models can learn perceptual metrics autonomously, without requiring human supervision. This suggests a potential link between image statistics, neural representations, and human visual perception in early vision processing. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn perceptual metrics without human supervision.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Online video super-resolution (VSR) is crucial for video processing, with existing methods limited in long-range temporal modeling. A new method, TS-Mamba, combines trajectory-aware modeling and low-complexity Mamba for efficient spatio-temporal aggregation. It uses trajectories to select similar tokens from previous frames and employs Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation for token aggregation. Shifted SSMs blocks, based on Hilbert scanning and shift operations, enhance spatial continuity. A trajectory-aware loss function supervises trajectory generation. TS-Mamba outperforms benchmark models in VSR on three datasets, with a 22.7% reduction in complexity. The code will be available on GitHub. <div>
arXiv:2508.10453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will be available at https://github.com.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data. However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset. We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

Summary:
STAS, a novel invasive pattern in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), is associated with recurrence and diminished survival rates. Large-scale diagnosis of STAS in LUAD is labor-intensive and prone to oversight. This study proposes a deep learning model, STAMP, for STAS diagnosis using histopathological images from multiple centers. The model features a dual-branch architecture, transformer-based instance encoding, and multi-pattern attention aggregation to enhance diagnostic accuracy. A similarity regularization constraint prevents feature redundancy and improves overall performance. STAMP achieved competitive results on STAS datasets from different hospitals, surpassing clinical standards with AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928. This research addresses the clinical need for efficient STAS diagnosis in LUAD using advanced deep learning techniques.

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features. Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images. Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces. Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology, suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

Summary:
TweezeEdit introduces a novel framework for image editing that improves semantic preservation and efficiency compared to existing methods. It avoids reliance on inversion anchors and instead regularizes the entire denoising path to retain source image semantics while efficiently incorporating target prompt semantics. By utilizing gradient-driven regularization and a consistency model, TweezeEdit achieves superior performance in preserving image semantics and aligning with target prompts. The method requires only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), making it suitable for real-time applications. TweezeEdit's direct path approach shortens editing paths and ensures consistent and efficient image editing. Overall, TweezeEdit outperforms existing methods in both semantic preservation and target alignment, offering a promising solution for high-quality and real-time image editing tasks.

arXiv:2508.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors, ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines. However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset. First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed method. The code of the project is available at https://github.com/Jay-xyj/SBDE.

Estimating human dance motion from both egocentric video and music is a challenging task with significant industrial implications. Existing methods either utilize egocentric video or music separately, but jointly estimating motion from both sources is underexplored. The authors present a novel approach using the EgoAIST++ dataset, comprising egocentric views and music for over 36 hours of dance motion data. Their EgoMusic Motion Network, including a Skeleton Mamba model, effectively captures the human body's skeleton structure. The approach is theoretically sound and surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in experiments while demonstrating robustness on real-world data. The fusion of egocentric video and music in predicting human dance motion opens new possibilities for improving the accuracy and realism of motion estimation algorithms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion. Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes effectively to real-world data.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning, existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity, and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability, reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent, trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces the concept of medical image grounding, aligning natural language phrases with regions in medical images for diagnostic purposes. The existing research limitations, such as modality coverage and annotation granularity, are addressed through the creation of Med-GLIP-5M dataset. This dataset consists of over 5.3 million region-level annotations across seven imaging modalities, supporting segmentation and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels. The Med-GLIP framework is proposed, which learns hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse data to recognize multi-granularity structures. Extensive experiments show that Med-GLIP outperforms existing baselines in grounding benchmarks and enhances performance in medical VQA and report generation tasks by integrating spatial outputs. The dataset will be made available soon for further research. <div>

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation (MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage, coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data -- enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks, including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on improving salient object detection in optical remote sensing images using a novel graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet). The network incorporates a visual state space (VSS) encoder for extracting multi-scale features and a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM) to enhance cross-layer interactions and structural perception. Additionally, the model features a LEVSS block decoder with an adaptive scanning strategy and a multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM) for capturing rich local region information. Experimental results show that the proposed GCRPNet outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in salient object detection tasks. The study demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model in handling challenges such as scale variations and low target-background contrast in optical remote sensing images. <div>

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.

<div> Keywords: retinal disease screening, partially supervised learning, domain generalization, feature distillation, pseudo label consistency

Summary: 
PSScreen is a novel Partially Supervised multiple retinal disease Screening model that addresses challenges in training models for multiple retinal disease screening using partially labeled datasets. The model consists of two streams, one learning deterministic features and the other learning probabilistic features with uncertainty injection. Textual guidance is utilized to decouple and align disease-wise features from the two streams using feature distillation for improved domain generalization. Pseudo label consistency is employed to tackle the label absent issue, and self-distillation transfers task-relevant semantics between streams for enhanced detection performances. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in detecting six retinal diseases and normal states, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. The code for PSScreen is available on GitHub for further research and development.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization, where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision. System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload. Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations.

<title>Retrieval-Augmented Prompt for OOD Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

<title>PTQAT: A Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Quantization Algorithm for 3D Perception Tasks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10557</link>

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks. To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers. Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies, actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy. This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer weights.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads. HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However, vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images. We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets, Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at: https://github.com/humza909/SAM-CEM-CD

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues. Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation, achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks. Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results. Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

<title>Towards Powerful and Practical Patch Attacks for 2D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>

arXiv:2508.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric, Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets, both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous mAP-based metrics.

<title>Fourier-Guided Attention Upsampling for Image Super-Resolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets.

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities. Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural preservation and improved clinical applicability.

<title>Increasing the Utility of Synthetic Images through Chamfer Guidance</title>

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2 exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%, respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\% reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling time.

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across 62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g., temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1 0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

<title>Processing and acquisition traces in visual encoders: What does CLIP know about your camera?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively, distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/ryan-caesar-ramos/visual-encoder-traces

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks. Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets. Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back) were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect lameness with as little as one second of video data.

<title>SemPT: Semantic Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models</title>

arXiv:2508.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot learning.

<title>Serial Over Parallel: Learning Continual Unification for Multi-Modal Visual Object Tracking and Benchmarking</title>

arXiv:2508.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks, causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data, reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by 27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format, progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity. Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification. We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset, we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face, which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition, and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales.

<title>HyperTea: A Hypergraph-based Temporal Enhancement and Alignment Network for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection (MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules: the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD, significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are available at https://github.com/Lurenjia-LRJ/HyperTea.

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently, T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time (TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

<title>IADGPT: Unified LVLM for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection, Localization, and Reasoning via In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across 400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in camera-ready.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive. Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization. This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

arXiv:2508.10704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection. To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network (MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at: https://github.com/JoohyeonL22/CountCluster .

Abstract: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward with NextStep-1, a 14B autoregressive model paired with a 157M flow matching head, training on discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens with next-token prediction objectives. NextStep-1 achieves state-of-the-art performance for autoregressive models in text-to-image generation tasks, exhibiting strong capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. Furthermore, our method shows strong performance in image editing, highlighting the power and versatility of our unified approach. To facilitate open research, we will release our code and models to the community.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory, processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target classification is possible.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones. Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection, and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC. To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality, setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook, which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance. Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS performance.

<title>EgoCross: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Cross-Domain Egocentric Video Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering (EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports, and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips, spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs, whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models. Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be released at: \href{https://github.com/MyUniverse0726/EgoCross}{https://github.com/MyUniverse0726/EgoCross.}

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD, which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing, where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images. The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets. The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs, including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images, collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track. Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code and data for the competition is available at: https://github.com/dariant/SSBC_2025.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches.

<title>Forgery Guided Learning Strategy with Dual Perception Network for Deepfake Cross-domain Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10741</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

<title>An Efficient Model-Driven Groupwise Approach for Atlas Construction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10743</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large 3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas construction and applications.

<title>From Diagnosis to Improvement: Probing Spatio-Physical Reasoning in Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity, failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse, state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion, CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/Clarifiedfish/AEGIS.

<title>Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

<title>Ultra-High-Definition Reference-Based Landmark Image Super-Resolution with Generative Diffusion Prior</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10779</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image. Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera. This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis, represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks (including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

<title>VasoMIM: Vascular Anatomy-Aware Masked Image Modeling for Vessel Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations. Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components: anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically, VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase. Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Abstract: Plant diseases are a major threat to food security globally. It is important to develop early detection systems which can accurately detect. The advancement in computer vision techniques has the potential to solve this challenge. We have developed a mobile-friendly solution which can accurately classify 101 plant diseases across 33 crops.

We evaluated performance across several lightweight architectures - MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, MobileNetV3-Large, and EfficientNet-B0, B1 - specifically chosen for their efficiency on resource-constrained devices. The results were promising, with EfficientNet-B1 delivering our best performance at 94.7% classification accuracy. This architecture struck an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-world deployment on mobile devices.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% / 50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e., Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9% success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment \& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the community.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views. Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions. The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and 2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving, collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed, introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based federated systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video generation paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering (VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%), and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks, but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

Abstract: We introduce TexVerse, a large-scale 3D dataset featuring high-resolution textures. While recent advances in large-scale 3D datasets have enhanced high-resolution geometry generation, creating high-resolution textures end-to-end remains underexplored due to the lack of suitable datasets. TexVerse fills this gap with a curated collection of over 858K unique high-resolution 3D models sourced from Sketchfab, including more than 158K models with physically based rendering (PBR) materials. Each model encompasses all of its high-resolution variants, bringing the total to 1.6M 3D instances. TexVerse also includes specialized subsets: TexVerse-Skeleton, with 69K rigged models, and TexVerse-Animation, with 54K animated models, both preserving original skeleton and animation data uploaded by the user. We also provide detailed model annotations describing overall characteristics, structural components, and intricate features. TexVerse offers a high-quality data resource with wide-ranging potential applications in texture synthesis, PBR material development, animation, and various 3D vision and graphics tasks.

Abstract: The Medico 2025 challenge addresses Visual Question Answering (VQA) for Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging, organized as part of the MediaEval task series. The challenge focuses on developing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models that answer clinically relevant questions based on GI endoscopy images while providing interpretable justifications aligned with medical reasoning. It introduces two subtasks: (1) answering diverse types of visual questions using the Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, and (2) generating multimodal explanations to support clinical decision-making. The Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, created from 6,500 images and 159,549 complex question-answer (QA) pairs, serves as the benchmark for the challenge. By combining quantitative performance metrics and expert-reviewed explainability assessments, this task aims to advance trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical image analysis.

<title>ToonComposer: Streamlining Cartoon Production with Generative Post-Keyframing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10881</link>

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening, and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage. ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios. To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

<title>STream3R: Scalable Sequential 3D Reconstruction with Causal Transformer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks. Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D understanding in streaming environments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at https://github.com/ignf/maestro.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning (VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

<title>Human-in-Context: Unified Cross-Domain 3D Human Motion Modeling via In-Context Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model. While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets. Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies. Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains. These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability. The source codes and models are available at https://github.com/BradleyWang0416/Human-in-Context.

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally, we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in existing methods.

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties, training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz. Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation, highlighting its practical potential.

<title>Invisible Watermarks, Visible Gains: Steering Machine Unlearning with Bi-Level Watermarking Design</title>

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML) models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO) framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability over existing VLMs.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes), we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152 achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast, accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical care and training.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings" that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney, 90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities, including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform. This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches, striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at https://github.com/ZhaomingKong/Haar-tSVD.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However, our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm. Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of precise manipulation and generalization.

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set, uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2% and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and long instruction following.

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of creation). The corpus was collected over six weeks from over 87,000 contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT 5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial access with revenue sharing to contributors.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper, we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math 2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions, sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods, such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an ``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design choices, datasets, and ablations.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii) an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment (VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames, fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations. Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation (DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/xinyiW915/DIVA-VQA.

<title>Geospatial Diffusion for Land Cover Imperviousness Change Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq 0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns from historical data that are significant for projecting future change. Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers. Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent. A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli. Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos; the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed 4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods rely heavily on photometric and geometric consistency constraints, but newer machine learning-based MVS methods check geometric consistency across multiple source views only as a post-processing step. In this paper, we present a novel approach that explicitly encourages geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views at different scales during learning (see Fig. 1). We find that adding this geometric consistency loss significantly accelerates learning by explicitly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, reducing the training iteration requirements to nearly half that of other MVS methods. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets, and competitive results on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, GC-MVSNet is the first attempt to enforce multi-view, multi-scale geometric consistency during learning.

Abstract: This study presents an automated lameness detection system that uses deep-learning image processing techniques to extract multiple locomotion traits associated with lameness. Using the T-LEAP pose estimation model, the motion of nine keypoints was extracted from videos of walking cows. The videos were recorded outdoors, with varying illumination conditions, and T-LEAP extracted 99.6% of correct keypoints. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used to compute six locomotion traits: back posture measurement, head bobbing, tracking distance, stride length, stance duration, and swing duration. The three most important traits were back posture measurement, head bobbing, and tracking distance. For the ground truth, we showed that a thoughtful merging of the scores of the observers could improve intra-observer reliability and agreement. We showed that including multiple locomotion traits improves the classification accuracy from 76.6% with only one trait to 79.9% with the three most important traits and to 80.1% with all six locomotion traits.

Abstract: In the realms of computer vision and natural language processing, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become indispensable tools, proficient in generating textual responses based on visual inputs. Despite their advancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias: the generated content is often driven more by the inherent priors of the underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) than by the input image. Empirical experiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as MLLMs often provide confident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent visual inputs. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward visual information, we propose two simple, training-free strategies. First, for tasks such as classification or multi-choice question answering, we introduce a "Post-Hoc Debias" method using an affine calibration step to adjust the output distribution. This approach ensures uniform answer scores when the image is absent, acting as an effective regularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more intricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to "Visual Debias Decoding", which mitigates bias by contrasting token log-probabilities conditioned on a correct image versus a meaningless one. Additionally, our investigation sheds light on the instability of MLLMs across various decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different settings, we achieve significant performance improvements--surpassing previously reported results--and raise concerns about the fairness of current evaluation practices. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in mitigating biases. These strategies not only prove beneficial in minimizing hallucinations but also contribute to the generation of more helpful and precise illustrations.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes semantically and spatially is crucial for the safe navigation of robots and autonomous vehicles, aiding obstacle avoidance and accurate trajectory planning. Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which infers complete voxel grids from 2D images, is gaining importance in robot vision for its resource efficiency compared to 3D sensors. However, this task inherently suffers from a 2D-3D discrepancy, where objects of the same size in 3D space appear at different scales in a 2D image depending on their distance from the camera due to perspective projection. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework called VPOcc that leverages a vanishing point (VP) to mitigate the 2D-3D discrepancy at both the pixel and feature levels. As a pixel-level solution, we introduce a VPZoomer module, which warps images by counteracting the perspective effect using a VP-based homography transformation. In addition, as a feature-level solution, we propose a VP-guided cross-attention (VPCA) module that performs perspective-aware feature aggregation, utilizing 2D image features that are more suitable for 3D space. Lastly, we integrate two feature volumes extracted from the original and warped images to compensate for each other through a spatial volume fusion (SVF) module. By effectively incorporating VP into the network, our framework achieves improvements in both IoU and mIoU metrics on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 datasets. Additional details are available at https://vision3d-lab.github.io/vpocc/.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visuals from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, introduced as Recon3DMind, is of significant interest to both cognitive neuroscience and computer vision. To advance this task, we present the fMRI-3D dataset, which includes data from 15 participants and showcases a total of 4,768 3D objects. The dataset consists of two components: fMRI-Shape, previously introduced and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Shape, and fMRI-Objaverse, proposed in this paper and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Objaverse. fMRI-Objaverse includes data from 5 subjects, 4 of whom are also part of the core set in fMRI-Shape. Each subject views 3,142 3D objects across 117 categories, all accompanied by text captions. This significantly enhances the diversity and potential applications of the dataset. Moreover, we propose MinD-3D++, a novel framework for decoding textured 3D visual information from fMRI signals. The framework evaluates the feasibility of not only reconstructing 3D objects from the human mind but also generating, for the first time, 3D textured meshes with detailed textures from fMRI data. We establish new benchmarks by designing metrics at the semantic, structural, and textured levels to evaluate model performance. Furthermore, we assess the model's effectiveness in out-of-distribution settings and analyze the attribution of the proposed 3D pari fMRI dataset in visual regions of interest (ROIs) in fMRI signals. Our experiments demonstrate that MinD-3D++ not only reconstructs 3D objects with high semantic and spatial accuracy but also provides deeper insights into how the human brain processes 3D visual information.

Abstract: Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) has traditionally relied on support images with annotated keypoints, a process that is often cumbersome and may fail to fully capture the necessary correspondences across diverse object categories. Recent efforts have explored the use of text queries, leveraging their enhanced stability and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches often remain constrained by their reliance on support queries, their failure to fully utilize the rich priors embedded in pre-trained large language models, and the limitations imposed by their parametric distribution assumptions. To address these challenges, we introduce CapeLLM, the first multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for CAPE. Our method only employs query image and detailed text descriptions as an input to estimate category-agnostic keypoints. Our method encompasses effective training strategies and carefully designed instructions for applying the MLLM to CAPE. Moreover, we propose an inference mechanism that further enhances the reasoning process for unseen keypoints. while flexibly modeling their underlying spatial distribution and uncertainty, allowing for adaptive refinement based on contextual cues. We conducted extensive experiments to apply the MLLM to CAPE effectively, focusing not only on the model architecture and prompt design but also on ensuring robustness across input variations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the MP-100 benchmark in the 1-shot and even 5-shot setting, marking a significant advancement in the field of category-agnostic pose estimation. Code is available at https://github.com/Junhojuno/CapeLLM.

Abstract: Vision-brain understanding aims to extract semantic information about brain signals from human perceptions. Existing deep learning methods for vision-brain understanding are usually introduced in a traditional learning paradigm missing the ability to learn the connectivities between brain regions. Meanwhile, the quantum computing theory offers a new paradigm for designing deep learning models. Motivated by the connectivities in the brain signals and the entanglement properties in quantum computing, we propose a novel Quantum-Brain approach, a quantum-inspired neural network, to tackle the vision-brain understanding problem. To compute the connectivity between areas in brain signals, we introduce a new Quantum-Inspired Voxel-Controlling module to learn the impact of a brain voxel on others represented in the Hilbert space. To effectively learn connectivity, a novel Phase-Shifting module is presented to calibrate the value of the brain signals. Finally, we introduce a new Measurement-like Projection module to present the connectivity information from the Hilbert space into the feature space. The proposed approach can learn to find the connectivities between fMRI voxels and enhance the semantic information obtained from human perceptions. Our experimental results on the Natural Scene Dataset benchmarks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Top-1 accuracies of 95.1% and 95.6% on image and brain retrieval tasks and an Inception score of 95.3% on fMRI-to-image reconstruction task. Our proposed quantum-inspired network brings a potential paradigm to solving the vision-brain problems via the quantum computing theory.

Abstract: Facial aging is a complex process, highly dependent on multiple factors like gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, etc., making it extremely challenging to learn a global aging prior to predict aging for any individual accurately. Existing techniques often produce realistic and plausible aging results, but the re-aged images often do not resemble the person's appearance at the target age and thus need personalization. In many practical applications of virtual aging, e.g. VFX in movies and TV shows, access to a personal photo collection of the user depicting aging in a small time interval (20$\sim$40 years) is often available. However, naive attempts to personalize global aging techniques on personal photo collections often fail. Thus, we propose MyTimeMachine (MyTM), which combines a global aging prior with a personal photo collection (using as few as 50 images) to learn a personalized age transformation. We introduce a novel Adapter Network that combines personalized aging features with global aging features and generates a re-aged image with StyleGAN2. We also introduce three loss functions to personalize the Adapter Network with personalized aging loss, extrapolation regularization, and adaptive w-norm regularization. Our approach can also be extended to videos, achieving high-quality, identity-preserving, and temporally consistent aging effects that resemble actual appearances at target ages, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) is a recent 3D scene reconstruction technique that enables real-time rendering of novel views by modeling scenes as parametric point clouds of differentiable 3D Gaussians. However, its rendering speed and model size still present bottlenecks, especially in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we identify and address two key inefficiencies in 3D-GS to substantially improve rendering speed. These improvements also yield the ancillary benefits of reduced model size and training time. First, we optimize the rendering pipeline to precisely localize Gaussians in the scene, boosting rendering speed without altering visual fidelity. Second, we introduce a novel pruning technique and integrate it into the training pipeline, significantly reducing model size and training time while further raising rendering speed. Our Speedy-Splat approach combines these techniques to accelerate average rendering speed by a drastic $\mathit{6.71\times}$ across scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generation techniques, current methods often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, commonly referred to as the Janus Problem. This paper identifies the root cause of the Janus Problem: viewpoint generation bias in diffusion models, which creates a significant gap between the actual generated viewpoint and the expected one required for optimizing the 3D model. To address this issue, we propose a tuning-free approach called the Attention and CLIP Guidance (ACG) mechanism. ACG enhances desired viewpoints by adaptively controlling cross-attention maps, employs CLIP-based view-text similarities to filter out erroneous viewpoints, and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with staged prompts to progressively refine 3D generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the Janus Problem without compromising generation speed, establishing ACG as an efficient, plug-and-play component for existing text-to-3D frameworks.

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular video is essential for real-world applications. We introduce DGNS, a hybrid framework integrating \underline{D}eformable \underline{G}aussian Splatting and Dynamic \underline{N}eural \underline{S}urfaces, effectively addressing dynamic novel-view synthesis and 3D geometry reconstruction simultaneously. During training, depth maps generated by the deformable Gaussian splatting module guide the ray sampling for faster processing and provide depth supervision within the dynamic neural surface module to improve geometry reconstruction. Conversely, the dynamic neural surface directs the distribution of Gaussian primitives around the surface, enhancing rendering quality. In addition, we propose a depth-filtering approach to further refine depth supervision. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that DGNS achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, along with competitive results in novel-view synthesis.

Abstract: The choice of data representation is a key factor in the success of deep learning in geometric tasks. For instance, DUSt3R recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction and showing that all key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes can be reduced to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem: the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image-one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object and the other to a canonical version of the object in its rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction to recover the complete shape of the object, even through self-occlusions. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation can be reduced to the prediction of DualPMs. Empirically, we demonstrate that this representation is a suitable target for deep networks to predict. Specifically, we focus on modeling quadrupeds, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on synthetic 3D data, consisting of one or two models per category, while generalizing effectively to real images. With this approach, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of such objects.

Abstract: Instruction tuning fine-tunes pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to handle real-world tasks. However, the rapid expansion of visual instruction datasets introduces data redundancy, leading to excessive computational costs. We propose a collaborative framework, DataTailor, which leverages three key principles--informativeness, uniqueness, and representativeness--for effective data selection. We argue that a valuable sample should be informative of the task, non-redundant, and represent the sample distribution (i.e., not an outlier). We further propose practical ways to score against each principle, which automatically adapts to a given dataset without tedious hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DataTailor achieves 101.3% of the performance of full-data fine-tuning with only 15% of the data, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining superior results. This exemplifies the "Less is More" philosophy in MLLM development. The code and data is available in this \href{https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/DataTailor}{URL}.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying deep neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning and computer vision. One promising, yet only preliminarily explored approach, is feature inversion, which attempts to reconstruct images from intermediate representations using trained inverse neural networks. In this study, we revisit feature inversion, introducing a novel, modular variation that enables significantly more efficient application of the technique. We demonstrate how our method can be systematically applied to the large-scale transformer-based vision models, Detection Transformer and Vision Transformer, and how reconstructed images can be qualitatively interpreted in a meaningful way. We further quantitatively evaluate our method, thereby uncovering underlying mechanisms of representing image features that emerge in the two transformer architectures. Our analysis reveals key insights into how these models encode contextual shape and image details, how their layers correlate, and their robustness against color perturbations. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of transformer-based vision models and their internal representations. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at github.com/wiskott-lab/inverse-tvm.

Abstract: Traditional biometric systems have encountered significant setbacks due to various unavoidable factors, for example, wearing of face masks in face recognition-based biometrics and hygiene concerns in fingerprint-based biometrics. This paper proposes a novel lightweight vision transformer with phase-only cross-attention (POC-ViT) using dual biometric traits of forehead and periocular portions of the face, capable of performing well even with face masks and without any physical touch, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. The POC-ViT framework is designed to handle two biometric traits and to capture inter-dependencies in terms of relative structural patterns. Each channel consists of a Cross-Attention using phase-only correlation (POC) that captures both their individual and correlated structural patterns. The computation of cross-attention using POC extracts the phase correlation in the spatial features. Therefore, it is robust against variations in resolution and intensity, as well as illumination changes in the input images. The lightweight model is suitable for edge device deployment. The performance of the proposed framework was successfully demonstrated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database, having 350 subjects. The POC-ViT framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods with an outstanding classification accuracy of $98.8\%$ with the dual biometric traits.

Abstract: Triangle meshes are fundamental to 3D applications, enabling efficient modification and rasterization while maintaining compatibility with standard rendering pipelines. However, current automatic mesh generation methods typically rely on intermediate representations that lack the continuous surface quality inherent to meshes. Converting these representations into meshes produces dense, suboptimal outputs. Although recent autoregressive approaches demonstrate promise in directly modeling mesh vertices and faces, they are constrained by the limitation in face count, scalability, and structural fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose Nautilus, a locality-aware autoencoder for artist-like mesh generation that leverages the local properties of manifold meshes to achieve structural fidelity and efficient representation. Our approach introduces a novel tokenization algorithm that preserves face proximity relationships and compresses sequence length through locally shared vertices and edges, enabling the generation of meshes with an unprecedented scale of up to 5,000 faces. Furthermore, we develop a Dual-stream Point Conditioner that provides multi-scale geometric guidance, ensuring global consistency and local structural fidelity by capturing fine-grained geometric features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Nautilus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and scalability. The project page is at https://nautilusmeshgen.github.io.

<title>Leveraging Motion Estimation for Efficient Bayer-Domain Computer Vision</title>

Abstract: Existing computer vision processing pipeline acquires visual information using an image sensor that captures pixel information in the Bayer pattern. The raw sensor data are then processed using an image signal processor (ISP) that first converts Bayer pixel data to RGB on a pixel by pixel basis, followed by video convolutional network (VCN) processing on a frame by frame basis. Both ISP and VCN are computationally expensive with high power consumption and latency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that eliminates the ISP and leverages motion estimation to accelerate video vision tasks directly in the Bayer domain. We introduce Motion Estimation-based Video Convolution (MEVC), which integrates sliding-window motion estimation into each convolutional layer, enabling prediction and residual-based refinement that reduces redundant computations across frames. This design bridges the structural gap between block-based motion estimation and spatial convolution, enabling accurate, low-cost processing. Our end-to-end pipeline supports raw Bayer input and achieves over 70\% reduction in FLOPs with minimal accuracy degradation across video semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection benchmarks, using both synthetic Bayer-converted and real Bayer video datasets. This framework generalizes across convolution-based models and marks the first effective reuse of motion estimation for accelerating video computer vision directly from raw sensor data.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) tasks, such as referring expression detection and segmentation tasks are important for linking visual entities to context, especially in complex reasoning tasks that require detailed query interpretation. This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning. Our results show that NAVER achieves SoTA performance comparing to recent end-to-end and compositional baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ControlNet/NAVER .

Abstract: Despite the significant advances in domain generalized stereo matching, existing methods still exhibit domain-specific preferences when transferring from synthetic to real domains, hindering their practical applications in complex and diverse scenarios. The probability distributions predicted by the stereo network naturally encode rich similarity and uncertainty information. Inspired by this observation, we propose to extract these two types of dark knowledge from the pre-trained network to model intuitive multi-modal ground-truth distributions for both edge and non-edge regions. To mitigate the inherent domain preferences of a single network, we adopt network ensemble and further distinguish between objective and biased knowledge in the Laplace parameter space. Finally, the objective knowledge and the original disparity labels are jointly modeled as a mixture of Laplacians to provide fine-grained supervision for the stereo network training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) Our method is generic and effectively improves the generalization of existing networks. (2) PCWNet with our method achieves the state-of-the-art generalization performance on both KITTI 2015 and 2012 datasets. (3) Our method outperforms existing methods in comprehensive ranking across four popular real-world datasets.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to localize target trajectories in videos specified by natural language expressions. Despite recent progress, the intrinsic relationship between the two subtasks of tracking and referring in RMOT has not been fully studied. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of their interdependence, revealing that current two-stage Referring-by-Tracking (RBT) frameworks remain fundamentally limited by insufficient modeling of subtask interactions and inflexible reliance on semantic alignment modules like CLIP. To this end, we propose JustHook, a novel two-stage RBT framework where a Hook module is firstly designed to redefine the linkage between subtasks. The Hook is built centered on grid sampling at the feature-level and is used for context-aware target feature extraction. Moreover, we propose a Parallel Combined Decoder (PCD) that learns in a unified joint feature space rather than relying on pre-defined cross-modal embeddings. Our design not only enhances the interpretability and modularity but also significantly improves the generalization. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI, Refer-KITTI-V2, and Refer-Dance demonstrate that JustHook achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the HOTA by +6.9\% on Refer-KITTI-V2 with superior efficiency. Code will be available soon.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn knowledge of tasks observed in sequential time steps while mitigating the forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Existing methods were designed to learn a single modality (e.g., image) over time, which limits their applicability in scenarios involving multiple modalities. In this work, we propose a novel continual learning framework that accommodates multiple modalities (image, video, audio, depth, and text). We train a model to align various modalities with text, leveraging its rich semantic information. However, this increases the risk of forgetting previously learned knowledge, exacerbated by the differing input traits across tasks. To alleviate the overwriting of previous knowledge of modalities, we propose a framework that consolidates intra-modal knowledge while incorporating relevant inter-modal information. This is achieved by self-regulating shifts in learned representations to gradually integrating novel knowledge into the information retained across modalities. Simultaneously, it mitigates inter-modal interference by selectively integrating knowledge from previously encountered modalities based on their mutual relevance. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy to re-align modality embeddings, effectively addressing biased alignment between modalities. We evaluate the proposed method in a wide range of continual learning scenarios using multiple datasets with different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ours outperforms existing methods in the scenarios, regardless of whether the identity of the modality is given.

Abstract: We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark and toolkit for occupancy forecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical information) and occupancy prediction (i.e., predicting current-frame occupancy from camera images. UniOcc unifies the data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), providing 2D/3D occupancy labels and annotating innovative per-voxel flows. Unlike existing studies that rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel evaluation metrics that do not depend on ground-truth labels, enabling robust assessment on additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and forecasting performance.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on scaling open-vocabulary action detection. Existing approaches for action detection are predominantly limited to closed-set scenarios and rely on complex, parameter-heavy architectures. Extending these models to the open-vocabulary setting poses two key challenges: (1) the lack of large-scale datasets with many action classes for robust training, and (2) parameter-heavy adaptations to a pretrained vision-language contrastive model to convert it for detection, risking overfitting the additional non-pretrained parameters to base action classes. Firstly, we introduce an encoder-only multimodal model for video action detection, reducing the reliance on parameter-heavy additions for video action detection. Secondly, we introduce a simple weakly supervised training strategy to exploit an existing closed-set action detection dataset for pretraining. Finally, we depart from the ill-posed base-to-novel benchmark used by prior works in open-vocabulary action detection and devise a new benchmark to evaluate on existing closed-set action detection datasets without ever using them for training, showing novel results to serve as baselines for future work. Our code is available at https://siatheindochinese.github.io/sia_act_page/ .

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they continue to face challenges in achieving competitive performance on ordinal regression (OR; a.k.a. ordinal classification). To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that LLaVA model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5\% to 93.2\% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0\% to 85.7\% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets.

Abstract: Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty in counting in images.

Abstract: Detecting plant diseases is a crucial aspect of modern agriculture, as it plays a key role in maintaining crop health and increasing overall yield. Traditional approaches, though still valuable, often rely on manual inspection or conventional machine learning techniques, both of which face limitations in scalability and accuracy. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as improved handling of long-range dependencies and better scalability for visual tasks. This review explores the application of ViTs in precision agriculture, covering a range of tasks. We begin by introducing the foundational architecture of ViTs and discussing their transition from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Computer Vision. The discussion includes the concept of inductive bias in traditional models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and how ViTs mitigate these biases. We provide a comprehensive review of recent literature, focusing on key methodologies, datasets, and performance metrics. This study also includes a comparative analysis of CNNs and ViTs, along with a review of hybrid models and performance enhancements. Technical challenges such as data requirements, computational demands, and model interpretability are addressed, along with potential solutions. Finally, we outline future research directions and technological advancements that could further support the integration of ViTs in real-world agricultural settings. Our goal with this study is to offer practitioners and researchers a deeper understanding of how ViTs are poised to transform smart and precision agriculture.

Abstract: Masked video modeling~(MVM) has emerged as a highly effective pre-training strategy for visual foundation models, whereby the model reconstructs masked spatiotemporal tokens using information from visible tokens. However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

<title>CCL-LGS: Contrastive Codebook Learning for 3D Language Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge: cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at https://epsilontl.github.io/CCL-LGS/.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks, corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

<title>Point or Line? Using Line-based Representation for Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings</title>

Abstract: We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization, graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and 21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.

Abstract: In this paper, we present InfoMax, a novel data pruning method, also known as coreset selection, designed to maximize the information content of selected samples while minimizing redundancy. By doing so, InfoMax enhances the overall informativeness of the coreset. The information of individual samples is measured by importance scores, which capture their influence or difficulty in model learning. To quantify redundancy, we use pairwise sample similarities, based on the premise that similar samples contribute similarly to the learning process. We formalize the coreset selection problem as a discrete quadratic programming (DQP) task, with the objective of maximizing the total information content, represented as the sum of individual sample contributions minus the redundancies introduced by similar samples within the coreset. To ensure practical scalability, we introduce an efficient gradient-based solver, complemented by sparsification techniques applied to the similarity matrix and dataset partitioning strategies. This enables InfoMax to seamlessly scale to datasets with millions of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of InfoMax in various data pruning tasks, including image classification, vision-language pre-training, and instruction tuning for large language models.

<title>Stepwise Decomposition and Dual-stream Focus: A Novel Approach for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation</title>

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2) \textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation, causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream \textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity, while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We present a framework for adapting a large pretrained latent diffusion model to high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image generation. The approach enables controllable synthesis and the creation of rare or out-of-distribution scenes beyond the training set. Rather than training a task-specific small model from scratch, we adapt an open-source text-to-image foundation model to the SAR modality, using its semantic prior to align prompts with SAR imaging physics (side-looking geometry, slant-range projection, and coherent speckle with heavy-tailed statistics). Using a 100k-image SAR dataset, we compare full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across the UNet diffusion backbone, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and the text encoders. Evaluation combines (i) statistical distances to real SAR amplitude distributions, (ii) textural similarity via Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) descriptors, and (iii) semantic alignment using a SAR-specialized CLIP model. Our results show that a hybrid strategy-full UNet tuning with LoRA on the text encoders and a learned token embedding-best preserves SAR geometry and texture while maintaining prompt fidelity. The framework supports text-based control and multimodal conditioning (e.g., segmentation maps, TerraSAR-X, or optical guidance), opening new paths for large-scale SAR scene data augmentation and unseen scenario simulation in Earth observation.

<title>Semantic Structure-Aware Generative Attacks for Enhanced Adversarial Transferability</title>

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

Abstract: We propose a novel memory module for building video generators capable of interactively exploring environments. Previous approaches have achieved similar results either by out-painting 2D views of a scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry-which quickly accumulates errors-or by using video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a memory module that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost required to use all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with varying object and camera motions. We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) deblurring models on our dataset and observe significant performance degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and generalizable deblurring models.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text, predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production pipeline. The code is available at: https://github.com/SJTU-Lucy/MEDTalk.

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks. However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

<title>Common Data Properties Limit Object-Attribute Binding in CLIP</title>

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and, as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of ``a yellow submarine and a blue bus'' or ``a blue submarine and a yellow bus''. Previous attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in arguably the most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density, incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to describe the object that is ``most salient'' to them, have a detrimental effect on binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the data expresses our identified data properties does CLIP learn almost perfect binding.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur, temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization. Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS inference speed.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations, we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities, enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11 benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at: https://github.com/zzeoZheng/HiCroPL.

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis. However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level, facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions. Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification. Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion cues.

To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce our BAV-Classroom-VQA dataset derived from real-world classroom video recordings at the Banking Academy of Vietnam. We present the methodology for data collection, annotation, and benchmark the performance of the selected VQA models on this dataset. Our initial experimental results demonstrate that all four models achieve promising performance levels in answering behavior-related visual questions, showcasing their potential in future classroom analytics and intervention systems.

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently, event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at https://github.com/suhang99/AsyncTrack-Motion-Solver.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/iSafetyBench/data.

<title>PromptSafe: Gated Prompt Tuning for Safe Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality, but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%), while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector (DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization. Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models with domain-specific heuristics to transform medical data review. In a controlled experimental study with experienced medical reviewers (n=10), we demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a 6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by 15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. Economic analysis of a representative Phase III oncology trial reveals potential cost savings of $5.1 million, primarily driven by accelerated database lock timelines (5-day reduction saving $4.4M), improved medical review efficiency ($420K savings), and reduced query management burden ($288K savings). These improvements were consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially accelerating drug development timelines such as database lock by 33% while maintaining regulatory compliance and significantly reducing operational costs. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

<title>Improved Regularization and Robustness for Fine-tuning in Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2111.04578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely used algorithm for transfer learning is fine-tuning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a target task with a small amount of labeled data. When the capacity of the pre-trained model is significantly larger than the size of the target dataset, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and memorizing the training labels. Hence, a crucial question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness against noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling -- the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self-label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of image and text datasets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task. When the target data set includes noisy labels, our approach outperforms baseline methods by an average of 3.56% in two noisy settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning excels at learning representations from large amounts of data. At the same time, generative models offer the complementary property of learning information about the underlying data generation process. In this study, we aim at establishing a principled connection between these two paradigms and highlight the benefits of their complementarity. In particular, we perform an analysis of self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis suggests a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a lower bound proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes and unlocking full unification. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating that our objective function allows to jointly train a backbone network in a discriminative and generative fashion, consequently outperforming existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that the solution can be integrated into a neuro-symbolic framework to tackle a simple yet non-trivial instantiation of the symbol grounding problem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/emsansone/GEDI.

Abstract: The use of commercial Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) has surged in the past decade, offering societal benefits but also raising risks such as airspace violations and privacy concerns. Due to the increased security risks, the development of autonomous drone detection and tracking systems has become a priority. In this study, we tackle this challenge, by using non-repetitive rosette scanning pattern LiDARs, particularly focusing on increasing the detection distance by leveraging the characteristics of the sensor. The presented method utilizes a particle filter with a velocity component for the detection and tracking of the drone, which offers added re-detection capability. A Pan-Tilt platform is utilized to take advantage of the specific characteristics of the rosette scanning pattern LiDAR by keeping the tracked object in the center where the measurement is most dense. The detection capabilities and accuracy of the system are validated through indoor experiments, while the maximum detection distance is shown in our outdoor experiments. Our approach achieved accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art indoor method while increasing the maximum detection range by approximately 80\% beyond the state-of-the-art outdoor method.

Abstract: The performance of the standard Online Robust Principal Component Analysis (OR-PCA) technique depends on the optimum tuning of the explicit regularizers and this tuning is dataset sensitive. We aim to remove the dependency on these tuning parameters by using implicit regularization. We propose to use the implicit regularization effect of various modified gradient descents to make OR-PCA tuning free. Our method incorporates three different versions of modified gradient descent that separately but naturally encourage sparsity and low-rank structures in the data. The proposed method performs comparable or better than the tuned OR-PCA for both simulated and real-world datasets. Tuning-free ORPCA makes it more scalable for large datasets since we do not require dataset-dependent parameter tuning.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) are pivotal tasks in the realm of autonomous driving, attracting considerable research attention. While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.

Abstract: Due to their large sizes, volumetric scans and whole-slide pathology images (WSIs) are often processed by extracting embeddings from local regions and then an aggregator makes predictions from this set. However, current methods require post-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) and often fail to localize small yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we introduce INSIGHT, a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap generation as an inductive bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps, INSIGHT employs a detection module with small convolutional kernels to capture fine details and a context module with a broader receptive field to suppress local false positives. The resulting internal heatmap highlights diagnostically relevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art classification results and high weakly-labeled semantic segmentation performance.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. However, the increasing complexity of modern QD devices makes calibration and control -- particularly at elevated temperatures -- a bottleneck to progress, highlighting the need for robust and scalable autonomous solutions. A major hurdle arises from trapped charges within the oxide layers, which induce random offset voltage shifts on gate electrodes, with a standard deviation of approximately 83~\si{\milli\volt} of variation within state-of-the-art present-day devices. Efficient characterization and tuning of large arrays of QD qubits depend on choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a physically intuitive framework for a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing, formation of all current channels, and gate characterization in the presence of trapped charges. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single set of measurements regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at $1.3$~\si{\kelvin} on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.

Abstract: Femoral artery access is essential for numerous clinical procedures, including diagnostic angiography, therapeutic catheterization, and emergency interventions. Despite its critical role, successful vascular access remains challenging due to anatomical variability, overlying adipose tissue, and the need for precise ultrasound (US) guidance. Needle placement errors can result in severe complications, thereby limiting the procedure to highly skilled clinicians operating in controlled hospital environments. While robotic systems have shown promise in addressing these challenges through autonomous scanning and vessel reconstruction, clinical translation remains limited due to reliance on simplified phantom models that fail to capture human anatomical complexity. In this work, we present a method for autonomous robotic US scanning of bifurcated femoral arteries, and validate it on five vascular phantoms created from real patient computed tomography (CT) data. Additionally, we introduce a video-based deep learning US segmentation network tailored for vascular imaging, enabling improved 3D arterial reconstruction. The proposed network achieves a Dice score of 89.21% and an Intersection over Union of 80.54% on a new vascular dataset. The reconstructed artery centerline is evaluated against ground truth CT data, showing an average L2 error of 0.91+/-0.70 mm, with an average Hausdorff distance of 4.36+/-1.11mm. This study is the first to validate an autonomous robotic system for US scanning of the femoral artery on a diverse set of patient-specific phantoms, introducing a more advanced framework for evaluating robotic performance in vascular imaging and intervention.

Abstract: Automatically synthesizing figures from text captions is a compelling capability. However, achieving high geometric precision and editability requires representing figures as graphics programs in languages like TikZ, and aligned training data (i.e., graphics programs with captions) remains scarce. Meanwhile, large amounts of unaligned graphics programs and captioned raster images are more readily available. We reconcile these disparate data sources by presenting TikZero, which decouples graphics program generation from text understanding by using image representations as an intermediary bridge. It enables independent training on graphics programs and captioned images and allows for zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference. We show that our method substantially outperforms baselines that can only operate with caption-aligned graphics programs. Furthermore, when leveraging caption-aligned graphics programs as a complementary training signal, TikZero matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including commercial systems like GPT-4o. Our code, datasets, and select models are publicly available.

Abstract: Capturing high-quality visual content under low-light conditions remains a challenging problem due to severe noise and underexposure, which degrade the performance of downstream applications. Traditional frame-based low-light image enhancement methods often amplify noise or fail to preserve structural details. Event cameras, offering high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution by asynchronously capturing brightness changes, emerge as a promising complement for low-light imaging. However, existing fusion methods fail to fully exploit this synergy, either by forcing modalities into a shared representation too early or by losing vital low-level correlations through isolated processing. To address these challenges, we propose EvRWKV, a novel framework that enables continuous cross-modal interaction through dual-domain processing. Our approach incorporates a Cross-RWKV module, leveraging the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture for fine-grained temporal and cross-modal fusion, and an Event Image Spectral Fusion Enhancer (EISFE) module, which jointly performs adaptive frequency-domain noise suppression and spatial-domain deformable convolution alignment. This continuous interaction maintains feature consistency from low-level textures to high-level semantics. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on real-world low-light datasets (SDE, SDSD, RELED) demonstrate that EvRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively enhancing image quality by suppressing noise, restoring structural details, and improving visual clarity in challenging low-light conditions.

Abstract: In recent years, Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30 of the computational resources and 20 GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.

<div> Keywords: social media, offensive content detection, misogynistic content, multimodal framework, test-time augmentation <br />
<br />
Summary: 
A new multimodal framework for detecting misogynistic and sexist content on social media has been proposed. The framework consists of three modules: Multimodal Attention, Graph-based Feature Reconstruction, and Content-specific Features Learning. By utilizing adaptive gating-based attention and graph-based feature refinement, the model can focus on relevant visual and textual information. Additionally, the framework incorporates misogyny-specific lexicons and text/image-specific feature learning. Test-time augmentation in feature space improves generalization on diverse inputs. The method was evaluated on two datasets, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods. The approach is tailored to address the challenges of detecting misogynistic content on social media platforms, offering a more effective solution for identifying and combatting offensive content directed towards women. <br /> <div>

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module (MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and 13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

Summary:<br />
Industrial anomaly detection is crucial in manufacturing, but traditional methods are limited due to a lack of defective samples. The proposed IAD-R1 framework enhances anomaly detection capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through a two-stage training strategy. By utilizing a high-quality dataset and structured control group relative policy optimization, IAD-R1 significantly improves accuracy on benchmark datasets and outperforms commercial models in zero-shot settings. The 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 shows superior performance, showcasing the effectiveness of the framework in industrial anomaly detection.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing, yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT) stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset (Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably, the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

Summary: 
CADAR is a novel approach for detecting cognitive attacks in augmented reality (AR). It integrates vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to create a symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge, salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model utilizes particle-filter based statistical reasoning for attack detection, combining the adaptability of pre-trained VLMs with the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle filtering. Experimental results on a diverse AR cognitive attack dataset demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baseline methods, highlighting the efficacy of neurosymbolic approaches in detecting and interpreting cognitive attacks in AR environments. <div>
arXiv:2508.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper, we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge, salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method -- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and interpretable cognitive attack detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and autonomous vehicle networks.

Summary: 
Affective computing is hindered by the lack of high-quality, diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. The proposed framework utilizes a synthetic depth face generation approach using an optimized GAN with Knowledge Distillation to enhance training stability, quality, and prevent mode collapse. Incorporating Genetic Algorithms to evolve GAN latent vectors based on image statistics significantly boosts diversity and visual quality for target emotions, outperforming traditional methods such as GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE. For emotion classification, feature extraction including LBP, HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features achieve high accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation metrics including FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR consistently show superior performance compared to existing approaches. <div>

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality, diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP, HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96% accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Keywords: Visual Instruction Finetuning, VLMs, Multimodal data, Data-efficient framework, Model-agnostic design<br />
<br />Summary: 
Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is crucial for improving post-training Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning, VIF requires both visual and textual data for joint understanding. The challenge lies in selecting the right data efficiently while maintaining quality and alignment. The proposed $\Delta$-AttnMask framework addresses this by quantifying sample quality through attention-guided masking of hidden states without the need for domain labels or extra training. Experiments show that $\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data, speeding up training by 5x and outperforming full-dataset baselines by +10.1% in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design makes it applicable across various modalities and architectures.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that $\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data, accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1% in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad applicability across modalities and architectures.

<div> Keywords: Facial expression recognition, source-free domain adaptation, personalized feature translation, latent space, unlabeled target data


Summary:
Facial expression recognition (FER) models are crucial for affective computing applications. However, deep FER models face challenges with subtle expressions and inter-subject variability. To address this, a source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) method called personalized feature translation (PFT) is proposed. PFT operates in the latent space, pre-training a translator on source data to transform subject-specific style features. This translator is then adapted using only unlabeled target data with neutral expressions, without the need for source data or image synthesis. By translating in the latent space, PFT creates discriminative embeddings optimized for classification, avoiding the complexity and computational overhead of image-based translation. PFT offers a lightweight and efficient solution for personalized adaptation of FER models in real-world applications.

arXiv:2508.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy, storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class. Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another. Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

Summary:
Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have improved emotional intelligence in affective computing. However, current emotional benchmarks have limitations in generalization abilities and reasoning capabilities. To address these gaps, MME-Emotion, a comprehensive benchmark, evaluates emotional understanding and reasoning in MLLMs across diverse scenarios using QA pairs. Analyzing 20 MLLMs, it reveals that current models perform poorly in emotional intelligence and that generalist models like Gemini-2.5-Pro excel in multimodal understanding, while specialist models like R1-Omni achieve comparable results through domain-specific post-training. MME-Emotion aims to enhance emotional intelligence in MLLMs for future progress. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress, current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and \textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$ recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark. \ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion, we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional intelligence in the future.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, adversarial prompts, evaluation framework, jailbreak strategies, Balanced Structural Decomposition

Summary: 
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to adversarial prompts, prompting the need for effective safety mechanisms. Current evaluation standards may overestimate the success of jailbreak strategies, leading researchers to introduce a four-axis evaluation framework focusing on input relevance and harmful output. A structural trade-off is identified, where prompts balancing relevance and novelty tend to evade filters, triggering dangerous output. To address this, the Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD) strategy is developed, restructuring prompts into sub-tasks with subtle out-of-distribution signals. Testing across various MLLMs, BSD consistently improves attack success rates, harmfulness of outputs, and reduces refusals compared to previous methods. This highlights a vulnerability in current multimodal safety systems, with BSD showing a $67\%$ success rate improvement and a $21\%$ increase in harmful outputs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off: highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content. However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD). The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

Summary: 
The field of Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has been limited by a lack of data, as manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. To address this issue, a new method has been proposed that combines limited handwritten formulas with large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas.

The TexTeller model, trained at scale using the Tex80M dataset and a small HME dataset, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. The model, dataset, and codebase will be openly released to encourage further research in the field. This innovative approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition.

However, the field of \textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression \textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80 million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller}, the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further research building upon our contributions.

Summary: 
GDAGS introduces a gradient-direction-aware framework to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting for improved view synthesis. It addresses issues of over-reconstruction and over-densification in complex scenes by prioritizing conflicting-gradient Gaussians for splitting and concordant-gradient Gaussians for densification. The gradient coherence ratio (GCR) and dynamic weighting mechanism play crucial roles in adaptive density control. Evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality while reducing memory consumption by 50%. It achieves superior geometric detail enhancement, suppresses unnecessary component proliferation, and constructs compact scene representations. GDAGS offers a more efficient and effective approach to Gaussian splatting for realistic and optimized rendering outcomes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control. Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized Gaussians utilization.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces FineState-Bench, an innovative evaluation framework for GUI agents focusing on fine-grained control capabilities. The existing benchmarks are criticized for emphasizing task completion and neglecting crucial control aspects. FineState-Bench includes 2257 task benchmarks across different platforms and employs a four-phase indicator for thorough assessment. A Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA) is developed for analyzing perception and positioning in GUI operations. Experimental results reveal that current models achieve only 32.8% accuracy in fine-grained interactions. The study demonstrates that visual positioning is the primary bottleneck for GUI proxies. Additionally, using the VDA in controlled experiments showed a significant boost in success rates with improved visual localization. All resources, including the framework and dataset, are open-source, contributing to further research and development in the field. <div>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions. However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations, designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web, mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8% fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments, quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully open-source. github: https://github.com/AnonymousThewarehouse/FineState-Bench huggingface: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Willtime2006/Static-FineBench

<div> Keywords: visual assistant systems, privacy protection, fine-grained segmentation, data-driven risk scoring, VLMs<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) are becoming more prevalent, raising concerns about user privacy, especially for blind and low vision users. Existing privacy protection methods often use coarse-grained segmentation, which can lead to usability issues by uniformly masking entire private objects. In response, the FiGPriv framework has been proposed, which integrates fine-grained segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism to selectively mask high-risk private information while preserving low-risk content. Evaluation using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset showed that FiG-Priv can preserve 26% more image content, improve the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by 11%, and enhance the identification of image content by 45%, all while ensuring privacy protection. More information on the project can be found on the project page at https://artcs1.github.io/VLMPrivacy/. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26% of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by 11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

<div> Efficient, Vision-and-Language Navigation, Adaptive Algorithms, Computation Reduction, Multi-Modal Transformer Models<br />
Summary:<br />
An emerging approach in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) involves history-aware multi-modal transformer models that analyze observation and navigation history to guide agent actions. While these models have shown improved performance, their large scale can pose challenges in practical settings with limited computational resources. This study introduces innovative input-adaptive navigation techniques to enhance VLN model efficiency. Existing input-adaptive methods were found to be ineffective in reducing computations without sacrificing performance. The authors propose three adaptive algorithms to address this issue: selectively processing panoramic views, importance-based adaptive thresholding for early-exit methods, and implementing a caching mechanism to prevent reprocessing of previously seen views. Evaluation on seven VLN benchmarks revealed a notable 2x reduction in computation across standard and continuous environments for three off-the-shelf agents. The code for these adaptive algorithms is available on GitHub. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/secure-ai-systems-group/adaptive-vision-and-language-navigation.

Summary: <br />
Visual reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complex nature of learning both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards. The integration of large perception models into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency has been a key challenge. In response, the proposed SegDAC method combines Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground segments semantically with text prompts. It incorporates a novel transformer-based architecture that dynamically handles the number of segments at each time step, learning which segments to focus on through online RL without human labels. Evaluation on the Maniskill3 benchmark, covering various manipulation tasks under visual perturbations, shows that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, even doubling previous performance on the most challenging setting. Additionally, SegDAC matches or surpasses prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards. Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks, such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves 8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM. Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks. We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules, highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging.

Summary:
Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication is challenging due to the complexity of multimodal gestures. The FusionEnsemble-Net proposed in this study addresses this challenge by dynamically fusing visual and motion data through four different spatiotemporal networks. By employing an attention-based fusion module, features from RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities are merged and fed into an ensemble of classifiers. The ensemble classification head then combines the outputs of these fused channels, resulting in enhanced model robustness. Experimental results on the MultiMeDaLIS dataset for Italian Sign Language show that FusionEnsemble-Net achieves a test accuracy of 99.44%, outperforming existing approaches. This study highlights the effectiveness of using an ensemble of spatiotemporal networks unified by attention-based fusion for accurate recognition of complex, multimodal isolated gestures in sign language communication.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net, a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network, features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

Summary: <br />
Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) presents challenges such as inter-signer variability and limited generalization to new sentence structures. To address these issues, a dual-architecture framework is proposed. A Signer-Invariant Conformer is introduced for the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, using convolutions and multi-head self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, a Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a dual-path temporal encoder captures fine-grained posture dynamics to comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the Isharah-1000 dataset show significant improvements, with the proposed conformer architecture achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on the SI challenge and the transformer model scoring a WER of 47.78% on the US task. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of task-specific networks in CSLR and set a new benchmark for future research efforts. Source code is available on GitHub for reference. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges, including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work. In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces IMA++, a large dataset for skin lesion segmentation, to investigate variability among annotators based on factors such as malignancy, tool, and skill level. The research reveals a significant association between inter-annotator agreement and the malignancy of skin lesions, with higher agreement for malignant cases. The study also demonstrates accurate prediction of agreement directly from dermoscopic images. Leveraging this association as a clinical feature in multi-task learning improves model performance across datasets, showing a 4.2% increase in balanced accuracy. The code for the study is openly available for further research and development. <div>
arXiv:2508.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA), measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic datasets.

X-UniMotion introduces a unified latent representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions, body poses, and hand gestures. This representation is highly expressive and identity-agnostic, allowing for detailed cross-identity motion transfer. The approach encodes motion directly from a single image into four disentangled latent tokens, facilitating superior motion fidelity and identity preservation. A self-supervised framework is used to learn the motion encoder and latent representation, alongside a video generative model, on diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is enforced using various techniques, while auxiliary decoders guide the learning of motion tokens for fine-grained and depth-aware embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that X-UniMotion outperforms existing methods, producing animations with high expressiveness and realism. <br /><br />Summary: X-UniMotion offers an innovative approach to human motion representation, enabling detailed and cross-identity motion transfer with superior fidelity and identity preservation. <div>

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions, body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression, one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses, and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised, end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained, semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2 is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\% improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the model complexity by half.

Cropped images are classified using an EfficientNet-B3 model trained on a 40-species subset specific to Belgium. The processing is done locally on standard hardware without the need for a discrete GPU, ensuring privacy and avoiding cloud costs. By excluding pigeons and reducing nuisance triggers with small entry ports on the feeder, the system improves classification accuracy. The classifier achieves high validation performance on the curated subset and practical field accuracy on additional species, making it suitable for citizen science biodiversity monitoring at home.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard bird monitoring in Belgian urban gardens. A motion triggered IP camera uploads short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers. Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy (top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the Waymo-3DSkelMo dataset, which provides high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with explicit interaction semantics for data-driven models in autonomous driving. The dataset enhances the quality of 3D pose sequences by utilizing 3D human body shape and motion priors extracted from the Waymo Perception dataset. It covers over 14,000 seconds across 800 real driving scenarios with rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene. The dataset also establishes 3D pose forecasting benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, serving as a foundational resource for research on fine-grained human behavior understanding in complex urban environments.

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios, including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to 250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human behavior understanding in complex urban environments.

<div> Keywords: Curb ramps, urban accessibility, image detection, dataset, RampNet<br />
Summary: 
Curb ramps are crucial for urban accessibility, but detecting them accurately in images has been a challenge due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. This paper introduces RampNet, a two-stage pipeline to address this issue. In Stage 1, a dataset of over 210,000 annotated Google Street View panoramas is generated by translating government curb ramp location data into pixel coordinates. In Stage 2, a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) is trained on the generated dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The dataset achieves a precision of 94.0% and recall of 92.5%, while the detection model reaches 0.9236 AP. By comparing with manually labeled panoramas, the pipeline's effectiveness is demonstrated, exceeding previous work. This study contributes the first large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches 0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

<div> Keywords: Object Goal Navigation, Generative flow-based framework, Indoor environments, Language models, Generalization<br />
Summary:<br />
The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task involves locating a specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions. The GOAL framework, proposed in this work, is a generative flow-based approach that models the semantic distribution of indoor environments. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to encode spatial priors as two-dimensional Gaussian fields, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. By bridging observed regions with LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps, GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson datasets. It also demonstrates strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. The framework's ability to capture uncertainty in indoor layouts and leverage contextual knowledge from language models makes it a valuable tool for tasks requiring object localization in complex environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work, we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D.

<div> Keywords: action semantics, body-part contact regions, vision task, PaIR-Net, PaIR dataset

Summary:
The article introduces a novel vision task that aims to predict both high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions simultaneously. This task is addressed by a framework called PaIR-Net, consisting of three key components: the Contact Prior Aware Module (CPAM), the Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS), and the Interaction Inference Module (IIM). The proposed task is enabled by the newly created PaIR dataset, containing a wide variety of images with actions, object categories, and body parts. Experimental results show that PaIR-Net outperforms baseline methods, with ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of each component. The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon publication. <div>

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and \textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon publication.

<div> Keywords: Micro-expression recognition, Motion Prompt Tuning, Facial movements, Training samples, Affective computing

Summary: 
Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) is proposed as a new method for adapting large pre-training models to micro-expression recognition (MER) tasks. This approach focuses on capturing subtle facial movements essential for effective MER by generating motion prompts through motion magnification and Gaussian tokenization. A group adapter is integrated into the pre-training model to enhance its ability to represent micro-expressions accurately. Experimental results on three MER datasets demonstrate that the MPT approach outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in improving MER performance. This novel technique addresses challenges in obtaining ME annotations and the scarcity of training samples in MER datasets. MPT offers a promising solution for leveraging large pre-training models for the nuanced recognition of micro-expressions, with implications for medical diagnosis, lie detection, and criminal investigation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression (ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models. While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its effectiveness.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR) as a practical solution to the limitations of existing Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) methods. RASR leverages semantic retrieval of high-resolution images from a reference database to enhance texture fidelity and visual realism in scenarios where manually curated target-reference pairs are not feasible. The RASR-Flickr30 benchmark dataset is introduced to support open-world retrieval, unlike previous datasets with fixed pairs. RASRNet, a proposed baseline model, combines semantic reference retrieval with a diffusion-based RefSR generator, resulting in improved PSNR and LPIPS metrics compared to Single Image Super Resolution methods. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RASR in generating realistic textures and highlight the potential of retrieval augmentation in bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131 LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

Summary: 
HyperKD introduces a novel knowledge distillation framework for transferring learned representations from a teacher model to a student model in hyperspectral remote sensing. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation frameworks, HyperKD enables inverse knowledge transfer across different spectral data types, guided by a simpler teacher model. By distilling knowledge from the Prithvi foundational model into a student model tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery, HyperKD addresses the spectral domain gap with spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperKD significantly improves representation learning in Masked Autoencoders, leading to enhanced reconstruction fidelity and improved performance in downstream tasks such as land cover classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction. This highlights the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery. HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction, underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Summary:
Animate-X++ is a new universal animation framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods for character image animation. It is able to generate high-quality videos for various character types, including anthropomorphic characters, by using a Pose Indicator to capture comprehensive motion patterns from driving videos. The framework also utilizes a multi-task training strategy to jointly train the animation and background dynamics tasks, resulting in more realistic videos with text-driven background dynamics. Additionally, Animate-X++ introduces a new benchmark, A2Bench, for evaluating its performance on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive experiments show the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++ in generating realistic and diverse character animations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation, we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions, while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

<div> attack, vision-language models, backdoor, input-aware, security

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel input-aware backdoor attack method, IAG, aimed at manipulating the grounding behavior of vision-language models (VLMs). The attack forces the model to identify a specific target object in an image, regardless of the user's query. An adaptive trigger generator is proposed to embed semantic information into the image, overcoming the open-vocabulary challenge. Stealthiness is ensured using a reconstruction loss to minimize visual differences between poisoned and clean images. A unified method for generating attack data is introduced. The effectiveness of IAG is theoretically and empirically evaluated, achieving an ASR@0.5 over 65% on various testing sets, with promising results on other datasets. Specific experiments, such as ablation studies and potential defense mechanisms, demonstrate the attack's robustness and transferability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image, regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our attack.

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However, existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions. GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

Summary: 
This paper explores the energy-efficient robust fitting of geometric models using neuromorphic computing. It addresses the lack of attention to energy efficiency in robust fitting, crucial due to the increasing concern about high energy consumption in AI applications. The study introduces a novel spiking neural network designed for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, specifically the Intel Loihi 2. The researchers develop event-driven formulations of model estimation that can be implemented on the Loihi 2 architecture, along with algorithmic strategies to overcome hardware limitations. Results indicate that the neuromorphic robust fitting approach consumes only 15% of the energy compared to running the standard robust fitting algorithm on a CPU, while achieving equivalent accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi 2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

Summary:<br />
CitySeg is a model for semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds in UAV scenarios. It incorporates text modality for open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. The model addresses challenges of non-uniform data distribution and semantic label discrepancies between datasets. It uses a local-global cross-attention network and hierarchical classification strategy. The hierarchical graph encoder captures data label relationships, and a two-stage training strategy with hinge loss improves feature separability. CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on closed-set benchmarks and enables zero-shot generalization without visual information. <div>

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive 3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces FTNet, a Few-shot Training-free Network for real-world deepfake detection. Unlike traditional methods, FTNet does not require training on large-scale known data but uses only one fake sample during evaluation. By comparing each test sample to known fake and real samples, FTNet classifies it based on the nearest sample category. The study analyzes AI-generated images from 29 generative models, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 8.7%. The approach emphasizes leveraging failed samples for better performance in real-world scenarios where models struggle to generalize on few-shot samples.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a ``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task, where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding, deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network (FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set, mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation, each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\% compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

<div> Mixture of Facial Experts, Identity Preservation, Video Generation, Large Facial Angles Dataset, Data Processing Pipeline

Summary:
The article introduces a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) model to address challenges in video generation related to identity preservation under large facial angles. The MoFE combines three specialized experts to capture different aspects of facial attributes: identity, semantics, and details. A data processing pipeline tailored to include Face Constraints and Identity Consistency ensures diversity in facial angles and coherent person-specific features in the dataset. A Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset comprising 460K video clips is curated to provide training data with annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The code and dataset are made publicly available for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations. First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.

<div> Keywords: AI-generated images, anomaly detection, CLIP encoder, unsupervised learning, proxy images

Summary:
Anomaly detection is used to create a universal AI-generated image detector that does not rely on specific AIIs for training. The discriminator utilizes a pre-trained CLIP encoder as a feature extractor and an unsupervised model inspired by normalizing flow techniques. Instead of AIIs, proxy images generated by modifying natural images are used for training. The model is trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images, with the option of also maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of this approach on AI-generated images from various generators. <div>
arXiv:2508.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images, which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs (generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images, optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by various image generators.

<div> Approach, GazeLT, human visual attention, long-tailed disease classification, deep learning

Summary:
The article introduces GazeLT, a novel approach for long-tailed disease classification that integrates and disintegrates human visual attention patterns during image interpretation. It leverages the temporal aspect of visual search processes and incorporates both fine-grained and coarser level disease-related information observed in a radiologist's eye gaze. The approach aims to improve automated image interpretation by capturing minor/incidental findings, especially in long-tailed disease classes. GazeLT is evaluated on the NIH-CXR-LT and MIMIC-CXR-LT datasets, outperforming existing long-tailed loss methods and visual attention-based baselines. The average accuracy metrics show a significant improvement, with GazeLT achieving a 4.1% increase over the best long-tailed loss and a 21.7% improvement over the visual attention-based baseline. The code for GazeLT is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes) during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism, to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification, namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets. GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

<div> sparse-view satellite images, 3D scene reconstruction, SkySplat, self-supervised framework, RPC model

Summary: 
SkySplat is a novel self-supervised framework designed to tackle the challenges of 3D scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images. By integrating the RPC model into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, SkySplat effectively utilizes sparse geometric cues for improved reconstruction without the need for ground-truth height maps. The Cross-Self Consistency Module (CSCM) helps to mitigate transient object interference, while a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy refines the reconstruction results. SkySplat outperforms existing methods, achieving an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy. It significantly reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 13.18 m to 1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark. <div>
arXiv:2508.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential, but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable 3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy. It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to 1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

Summary:
Video-EM is a novel framework designed to enhance video question answering by addressing the limitations of existing keyframe retrieval methods for long-form videos. Inspired by human episodic memory, Video-EM models keyframes as temporally ordered events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics for better narrative reconstruction. By leveraging chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs, Video-EM efficiently identifies a minimal yet informative subset of episodic memories, leading to improved question-answering performance. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Video-EM, achieving performance gains of 4-9 percent over baselines while using fewer frames.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently, recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information, diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore, the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs. Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, image detection, semantic-aware reconstruction error, fake images, generative models

Summary:
Semantic-aware reconstruction error (SARE) is proposed as a novel method for detecting fake images generated by diverse generative models. The concept behind SARE is that fake images exhibit higher similarity to their captions compared to real images, leading to minimal semantic shifts during caption-guided reconstruction. This property is leveraged to differentiate between real and fake images, enabling robust detection across various generative models. SARE outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like GenImage and CommunityForensics, showcasing strong generalization capabilities. By quantifying semantic differences between images and their caption-guided reconstructions, SARE serves as a discriminative feature for improved detection performance in the context of diffusion-generated images. <div>
arXiv:2508.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models, since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images. Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images, which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization, outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and CommunityForensics.

arXiv:2508.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information, resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction, CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network (ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12, respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements (AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

Summary: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have transformed computer vision but lack explicit spatial biases, affecting performance on structured tasks. Existing approaches use fixed distance metrics for attention weighting, limiting adaptability. Inspired by language models, the new Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT) introduces Context-Aware Gating (CAG) for dynamic, data-dependent decay. This modulates spatial attention based on content relevance and proximity. Addressing the 1D-to-2D adaptation challenge, SDT integrates spatial priors with content representations. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show improvements over baselines, establishing data-dependent spatial decay as a new approach for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics, applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX) significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing (CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements. To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks' superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents, called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations. We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module, correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$ improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

<title>Iterative Volume Fusion for Asymmetric Stereo Matching</title>

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching (IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

<title>GoViG: Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation</title>

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation (GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and (2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies, one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain generalization.

<title>Exploring the Equivalence of Closed-Set Generative and Real Data Augmentation in Image Classification</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e., closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments, we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

<title>Topological Invariant-Based Iris Identification via Digital Homology and Machine Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09555</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids (e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN, and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy, outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact, interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing, and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather, and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog and snow conditions.

<title>WEC-DG: Multi-Exposure Wavelet Correction Method Guided by Degradation Description</title>

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

<title>Dual Recursive Feedback on Generation and Appearance Latents for Pose-Robust Text-to-Image Diffusion</title>

arXiv:2508.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF) system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models. The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is available at https://github.com/jwonkm/DRF.

<title>SHALE: A Scalable Benchmark for Fine-grained Hallucination Evaluation in LVLMs</title>

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs, we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and 6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios. Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

Abstract: This paper introduces BAAS, a new Extended Object Tracking (EOT) and fusion-based label annotation framework for radar detections in autonomous driving. Our framework utilizes Bayesian-based tracking, smoothing and eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic objects and class types

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

<title>SVG-Head: Hybrid Surface-Volumetric Gaussians for High-Fidelity Head Reconstruction and Real-Time Editing</title>

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation, head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results, but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores, state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images, especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work, we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

<title>BridgeTA: Bridging the Representation Gap in Knowledge Distillation via Teacher Assistant for Bird's Eye View Map Segmentation</title>

arXiv:2508.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first 3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full 3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics, scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11 clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10) dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation, which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in real-world data.

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS), traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness. Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism, demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures, contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability. Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening.

<title>Multi-Sequence Parotid Gland Lesion Segmentation via Expert Text-Guided Segment Anything Model</title>

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts (points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module, which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result. Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift. Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes. Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem, ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided neurosurgery.

Abstract: Robust ball tracking under occlusion remains a key challenge in sports video analysis, affecting tasks like event detection and officiating. We present TOTNet, a Temporal Occlusion Tracking Network that leverages 3D convolutions, visibility-weighted loss, and occlusion augmentation to improve performance under partial and full occlusions. Developed in collaboration with Paralympics Australia, TOTNet is designed for real-world sports analytics. We introduce TTA, a new occlusion-rich table tennis dataset collected from professional-level Paralympic matches, comprising 9,159 samples with 1,996 occlusion cases. Evaluated on four datasets across tennis, badminton, and table tennis, TOTNet significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE from 37.30 to 7.19 and improving accuracy on fully occluded frames from 0.63 to 0.80. These results demonstrate TOTNets effectiveness for offline sports analytics in fast-paced scenarios. Code and data access:\href{https://github.com/AugustRushG/TOTNet}{AugustRushG/TOTNet}.

<title>Noise-adapted Neural Operator for Robust Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging</title>

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping, facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data, thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness. Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

<title>NegFaceDiff: The Power of Negative Context in Identity-Conditioned Diffusion for Synthetic Face Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09661</link>

arXiv:2508.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability, leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from 2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

<title>GSFixer: Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting with Reference-Guided Video Diffusion Priors</title>

arXiv:2508.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations. To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs. The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

<title>Surg-InvNeRF: Invertible NeRF for 3D tracking and reconstruction in surgical vision</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09681</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field (InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable NeRF-based reconstruction.

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2 million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance. This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma geNet, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

arXiv:2508.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT). Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features, effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

arXiv:2508.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays, preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent, task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/NEURAL.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates. Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection. However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular, graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid diagnostics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/MMSN/.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii) a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision that can be used downstream for fault detection.

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment. Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark. M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical design.

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely, generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements. To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However, these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy, which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/MoIIE.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching, to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration. In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method, consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page: https://nahyuklee.github.io/cmnet.

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely, we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue as well.

<title>MeMoSORT: Memory-Assisted Filtering and Motion-Adaptive Association Metric for Multi-Person Tracking</title>

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter (MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU (Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of 67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

<title>MUJICA: Reforming SISR Models for PBR Material Super-Resolution via Cross-Map Attention</title>

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention (MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR material datasets.

<title>Automated Segmentation of Coronal Brain Tissue Slabs for 3D Neuropathology</title>

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of \textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue, from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and \textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\% Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels. Our tool is publicly available at surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PhotoTools.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the learned physical parameters.

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from 2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again -- WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local species or cross border aviation restrictions.

<title>Evolution of Low-Level and Texture Human-CLIP Alignment</title>

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations, improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

arXiv:2508.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion understanding, and behavior interpretation.

<title>Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action Pretraining</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09822</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

<title>Reverse Convolution and Its Applications to Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications.

arXiv:2508.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward pass across unseen datasets in testing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity. Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation. To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

Abstract: We present a benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on a small-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset, evaluating both unconditional and conditional pipelines. Our study compares UNet and DiT architectures for unconditional generation and explores LoRA-based fine-tuning of pretrained Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

arXiv:2508.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume. Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size, data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

arXiv:2508.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation. Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time, and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence. Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second, to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x 16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time, achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect this connection.

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However, current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency} and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these, we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1) \textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2) \textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion, refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis, video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions, especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises: how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME). Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that create a universal representation space and then collaborate with source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range. Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel approach for rapid scene capture.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any fake video in model training.

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts, HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by 5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.

<title>Quo Vadis Handwritten Text Generation for Handwritten Text Recognition?</title>

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to low-resource HTR.

<title>AST-n: A Fast Sampling Approach for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction using Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09943</link>

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 % of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM) above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

<title>Stable Diffusion Models are Secretly Good at Visual In-Context Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render' approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait video manipulation.

Abstract: Progress in AI for automated nutritional analysis is critically hampered by the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies and high-quality, real-world benchmark datasets. To address this, we introduce three primary contributions. First, we present the January Food Benchmark (JFB), a publicly available collection of 1,000 food images with human-validated annotations. Second, we detail a comprehensive benchmarking framework, including robust metrics and a novel, application-oriented overall score designed to assess model performance holistically. Third, we provide baseline results from both general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and our own specialized model, january/food-vision-v1. Our evaluation demonstrates that the specialized model achieves an Overall Score of 86.2, a 12.1-point improvement over the best-performing general-purpose configuration. This work offers the research community a valuable new evaluation dataset and a rigorous framework to guide and benchmark future developments in automated nutritional analysis.

<title>MOC: Meta-Optimized Classifier for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI) classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC) comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions, offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic training data is severely limited. Code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MOC.

<title>PERSONA: Personalized Whole-Body 3D Avatar with Pose-Driven Deformations from a Single Image</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09973</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first, a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach, learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement. We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them. To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse poses.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D scene representation, offering high-fidelity photorealistic rendering with real-time performance. Beyond novel view synthesis, the explicit and compact nature of 3DGS enables a wide range of downstream applications that require geometric and semantic understanding. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in 3DGS applications. It first introduces 2D foundation models that support semantic understanding and control in 3DGS applications, followed by a review of NeRF-based methods that inform their 3DGS counterparts. We then categorize 3DGS applications into segmentation, editing, generation, and other functional tasks. For each, we summarize representative methods, supervision strategies, and learning paradigms, highlighting shared design principles and emerging trends. Commonly used datasets and evaluation protocols are also summarized, along with comparative analyses of recent methods across public benchmarks. To support ongoing research and development, a continually updated repository of papers, code, and resources is maintained at https://github.com/heshuting555/Awesome-3DGS-Applications.

<title>LLMC+: Benchmarking Vision-Language Model Compression with a Plug-and-play Toolkit</title>

arXiv:2508.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods. However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1) Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules, hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2) Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques, without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile, plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3) Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/LightCompress.

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components: Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning, enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts. To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards. Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging storyboards than existing baselines.

<title>Echo-4o: Harnessing the Power of GPT-4o Synthetic Images for Improved Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind. Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data? In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries. Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o. In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions. However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework. Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/betterfly123/MoLAN-Framework.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached 0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current optimal large-scale pre-training model ECGFounder, it has improved by 0.111 and 0.19.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is widely used in front-end development and UI/UX design due to its scalability, editability, and rendering efficiency. However, turning creative ideas into precise vector graphics remains a time-consuming challenge. To address this, we introduce SVG-1M, a large-scale dataset of high-quality SVGs paired with natural language descriptions. Through advanced data augmentation and annotation, we create well-aligned Text to SVG training pairs, including a subset with Chain of Thought annotations for enhanced semantic guidance. Based on this dataset, we propose SVGen, an end-to-end model that generates SVG code from natural language inputs. Our approach ensures semantic accuracy and structural completeness, supported by curriculum learning and reinforcement learning optimization. Experiments show that SVGen outperforms general large models and traditional rendering methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and dataset are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming medical imaging by enabling capabilities such as data synthesis, image enhancement, modality translation, and spatiotemporal modeling. This review presents a comprehensive and forward-looking synthesis of recent advances in generative modeling including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models, and emerging multimodal foundation architectures and evaluates their expanding roles across the clinical imaging continuum. We systematically examine how generative AI contributes to key stages of the imaging workflow, from acquisition and reconstruction to cross-modality synthesis, diagnostic support, and treatment planning. Emphasis is placed on both retrospective and prospective clinical scenarios, where generative models help address longstanding challenges such as data scarcity, standardization, and integration across modalities. To promote rigorous benchmarking and translational readiness, we propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing pixel-level fidelity, feature-level realism, and task-level clinical relevance. We also identify critical obstacles to real-world deployment, including generalization under domain shift, hallucination risk, data privacy concerns, and regulatory hurdles. Finally, we explore the convergence of generative AI with large-scale foundation models, highlighting how this synergy may enable the next generation of scalable, reliable, and clinically integrated imaging systems. By charting technical progress and translational pathways, this review aims to guide future research and foster interdisciplinary collaboration at the intersection of AI, medicine, and biomedical engineering.

<title>HiFi-Mamba: Dual-Stream W-Laplacian Enhanced Mamba for High-Fidelity MRI Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data remains a challenging problem in MRI. While Mamba variants for vision tasks offer promising long-range modeling capabilities with linear-time complexity, their direct application to MRI reconstruction inherits two key limitations: (1) insensitivity to high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) reliance on redundant multi-directional scanning. To address these limitations, we introduce High-Fidelity Mamba (HiFi-Mamba), a novel dual-stream Mamba-based architecture comprising stacked W-Laplacian (WL) and HiFi-Mamba blocks. Specifically, the WL block performs fidelity-preserving spectral decoupling, producing complementary low- and high-frequency streams. This separation enables the HiFi-Mamba block to focus on low-frequency structures, enhancing global feature modeling. Concurrently, the HiFi-Mamba block selectively integrates high-frequency features through adaptive state-space modulation, preserving comprehensive spectral details. To eliminate the scanning redundancy, the HiFi-Mamba block adopts a streamlined unidirectional traversal strategy that preserves long-range modeling capability with improved computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard MRI reconstruction benchmarks demonstrate that HiFi-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based, Transformer-based, and other Mamba-based models in reconstruction accuracy while maintaining a compact and efficient model design.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integration of information across various data modalities, such as clinical time-series, medical images and textual reports. Compared to other domains, real-world medical data is heterogeneous in nature, limited in size, and sparse due to missing modalities. This significantly limits model performance in clinical prediction tasks. Inspired by clinical workflows, we introduce MedPatch, a multi-stage multimodal fusion architecture, which seamlessly integrates multiple modalities via confidence-guided patching. MedPatch comprises three main components: (i) a multi-stage fusion strategy that leverages joint and late fusion simultaneously, (ii) a missingness-aware module that handles sparse samples with missing modalities, (iii) a joint fusion module that clusters latent token patches based on calibrated unimodal token-level confidence. We evaluated MedPatch using real-world data consisting of clinical time-series data, chest X-ray images, radiology reports, and discharge notes extracted from the MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR, and MIMIC-Notes datasets on two benchmark tasks, namely in-hospital mortality prediction and clinical condition classification. Compared to existing baselines, MedPatch achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our work highlights the effectiveness of confidence-guided multi-stage fusion in addressing the heterogeneity of multimodal data, and establishes new state-of-the-art benchmark results for clinical prediction tasks.

Abstract: Colonoscopy is still the main method of detection and segmentation of colonic polyps, and recent advancements in deep learning networks such as U-Net, ResUNet, Swin-UNet, and PraNet have made outstanding performance in polyp segmentation. Yet, the problem is extremely challenging due to high variation in size, shape, endoscopy types, lighting, imaging protocols, and ill-defined boundaries (fluid, folds) of the polyps, rendering accurate segmentation a challenging and problematic task. To address these critical challenges in polyp segmentation, we introduce a hybrid (Transformer + CNN) model that is crafted to enhance robustness against evolving polyp characteristics. Our hybrid architecture demonstrates superior performance over existing solutions, particularly in addressing two critical challenges: (1) accurate segmentation of polyps with ill-defined margins through boundary-aware attention mechanisms, and (2) robust feature extraction in the presence of common endoscopic artifacts, including specular highlights, motion blur, and fluid occlusions. Quantitative evaluations reveal significant improvements in segmentation accuracy (Recall improved by 1.76%, i.e., 0.9555, accuracy improved by 0.07%, i.e., 0.9849) and artifact resilience compared to state-of-the-art polyp segmentation methods.

Abstract: The use of diverse modalities, such as omics, medical images, and clinical data can not only improve the performance of prognostic models but also deepen an understanding of disease mechanisms and facilitate the development of novel treatment approaches. However, medical data are complex, often incomplete, and contains missing modalities, making effective handling its crucial for training multimodal models. We introduce impuTMAE, a novel transformer-based end-to-end approach with an efficient multimodal pre-training strategy. It learns inter- and intra-modal interactions while simultaneously imputing missing modalities by reconstructing masked patches. Our model is pre-trained on heterogeneous, incomplete data and fine-tuned for glioma survival prediction using TCGA-GBM/LGG and BraTS datasets, integrating five modalities: genetic (DNAm, RNA-seq), imaging (MRI, WSI), and clinical data. By addressing missing data during pre-training and enabling efficient resource utilization, impuTMAE surpasses prior multimodal approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in glioma patient survival prediction.

Abstract: Different CT segmentation datasets are typically obtained from different scanners under different capture settings and often provide segmentation labels for a limited and often disjoint set of organs. Using these heterogeneous data effectively while preserving patient privacy can be challenging. This work presents a novel federated learning approach to achieve universal segmentation across diverse abdominal CT datasets by utilizing model uncertainty for aggregation and predictive uncertainty for inference. Our approach leverages the inherent noise in stochastic mini-batch gradient descent to estimate a distribution over the model weights to provide an on-the-go uncertainty over the model parameters at the client level. The parameters are then aggregated at the server using the additional uncertainty information using a Bayesian-inspired inverse-variance aggregation scheme. Furthermore, the proposed method quantifies prediction uncertainty by propagating the uncertainty from the model weights, providing confidence measures essential for clinical decision-making. In line with recent work shown, predictive uncertainty is utilized in the inference stage to improve predictive performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in improving both the quality of federated aggregation and uncertainty-weighted inference compared to previously established baselines.

Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of applying zero-shot self-supervised learning reconstruction to reduce breath-hold times in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Methods: Breath-hold MRCP was acquired from 11 healthy volunteers on a 3T scanner using an incoherent k-space sampling pattern leading to a breath-hold duration of 14s. We evaluated zero-shot reconstruction of breath-hold MRCP against parallel imaging of respiratory-triggered MRCP acquired in 338s on average and compressed sensing reconstruction of breath-hold MRCP. To address the long computation times of zero-shot trainings, we used a training approach that leverages a pretrained network to reduce backpropagation depth during training. Results: Zero-shot learning reconstruction significantly improved visual image quality compared to compressed sensing reconstruction, particularly in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and ductal delineation, and reached a level of quality comparable to that of successful respiratory-triggered acquisitions with regular breathing patterns. Shallow training provided nearly equivalent reconstruction performance with a training time of 11 minutes in comparison to 271 minutes for a conventional zero-shot training. Conclusion: Zero-shot learning delivers high-fidelity MRCP reconstructions with reduced breath-hold times, and shallow training offers a practical solution for translation to time-constrained clinical workflows.

<title>Learning to Detect Unknown Jailbreak Attacks in Large Vision-Language Models: A Unified and Accurate Approach</title>

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. Although recent detection works have shifted to internal representations due to their rich cross-modal information, most methods rely on heuristic rules rather than principled objectives, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a novel unsupervised framework that formulates jailbreak detection as anomaly detection. LoD introduces two key components: Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors (MSCAV), which capture layer-wise safety-related representations across modalities, and the Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder, which models the distribution of MSCAV derived from safe inputs and detects anomalies via reconstruction errors. By training the auto-encoder (AE) solely on safe samples without attack labels, LoD naturally identifies jailbreak inputs as distributional anomalies, enabling accurate and unified detection of jailbreak attacks. Comprehensive experiments on three different LVLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate that LoD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average AUROC of 0.9951 and an improvement of up to 38.89% in the minimum AUROC over the strongest baselines.

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models. We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

Abstract: Explaining deep learning models is essential for clinical integration of medical image analysis systems. A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations. This offers a practical path from explainable AI to explained AI in digital pathology and beyond. Code and prompts are available at https://github.com/nki-ai/x2x.

Abstract: While analysing rare blood cell aggregates remains challenging in automated haematology, they could markedly advance label-free functional diagnostics. Conventional flow cytometers efficiently perform cell counting with leukocyte differentials but fail to identify aggregates with flagged results, requiring manual reviews. Quantitative phase imaging flow cytometry captures detailed aggregate morphologies, but clinical use is hampered by massive data storage and offline processing. Incorporating hidden biomarkers into routine haematology panels would significantly improve diagnostics without flagged results. We present RT-HAD, an end-to-end deep learning-based image and data processing framework for off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM), which combines physics-consistent holographic reconstruction and detection, representing each blood cell in a graph to recognize aggregates. RT-HAD processes >30 GB of image data on-the-fly with turnaround time of <1.5 min and error rate of 8.9% in platelet aggregate detection, which matches acceptable laboratory error rates of haematology biomarkers and solves the big data challenge for point-of-care diagnostics.

Abstract: Mammography report generation is a critical yet underexplored task in medical AI, characterized by challenges such as multiview image reasoning, high-resolution visual cues, and unstructured radiologic language. In this work, we introduce AMRG (Automatic Mammography Report Generation), the first end-to-end framework for generating narrative mammography reports using large vision-language models (VLMs). Building upon MedGemma-4B-it-a domain-specialized, instruction-tuned VLM-we employ a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling lightweight adaptation with minimal computational overhead. We train and evaluate AMRG on DMID, a publicly available dataset of paired high-resolution mammograms and diagnostic reports. This work establishes the first reproducible benchmark for mammography report generation, addressing a longstanding gap in multimodal clinical AI. We systematically explore LoRA hyperparameter configurations and conduct comparative experiments across multiple VLM backbones, including both domain-specific and general-purpose models under a unified tuning protocol. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across both language generation and clinical metrics, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.5691, METEOR of 0.6152, CIDEr of 0.5818, and BI-RADS accuracy of 0.5582. Qualitative analysis further highlights improved diagnostic consistency and reduced hallucinations. AMRG offers a scalable and adaptable foundation for radiology report generation and paves the way for future research in multimodal medical AI.

Abstract: Survival analysis utilizing multiple longitudinal medical images plays a pivotal role in the early detection and prognosis of diseases by providing insight beyond single-image evaluations. However, current methodologies often inadequately utilize censored data, overlook correlations among longitudinal images measured over multiple time points, and lack interpretability. We introduce SurLonFormer, a novel Transformer-based neural network that integrates longitudinal medical imaging with structured data for survival prediction. Our architecture comprises three key components: a Vision Encoder for extracting spatial features, a Sequence Encoder for aggregating temporal information, and a Survival Encoder based on the Cox proportional hazards model. This framework effectively incorporates censored data, addresses scalability issues, and enhances interpretability through occlusion sensitivity analysis and dynamic survival prediction. Extensive simulations and a real-world application in Alzheimer's disease analysis demonstrate that SurLonFormer achieves superior predictive performance and successfully identifies disease-related imaging biomarkers.

<title>DAgger Diffusion Navigation: DAgger Boosted Diffusion Policy for Vision-Language Navigation</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces. Existing VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning framework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable waypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the high-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework suffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each stage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the quality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations, we propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE policy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and planning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional diffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future actions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint predictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible instruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in imitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation tasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory augmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This approach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to recover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based models in terms of navigation performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Tokishx/DifNav.

<title>Combating Noisy Labels via Dynamic Connection Masking</title>

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code will soon be publicly available.

Abstract: Existing video recommender systems rely primarily on user-defined metadata or on low-level visual and acoustic signals extracted by specialised encoders. These low-level features describe what appears on the screen but miss deeper semantics such as intent, humour, and world knowledge that make clips resonate with viewers. For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or an ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such distinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible to traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple, recommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects high-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip into a rich natural-language description (e.g. "a superhero parody with slapstick fights and orchestral stabs"), bridging the gap between raw content and user intent. We use MLLM output with a state-of-the-art text encoder and feed it into standard collaborative, content-based, and generative recommenders. On the MicroLens-100K dataset, which emulates user interactions with TikTok-style videos, our framework consistently surpasses conventional video, audio, and metadata features in five representative models. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging MLLMs as on-the-fly knowledge extractors to build more intent-aware video recommenders.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered impressive results in language understanding, generation, reasoning, and pushes the ability boundary of multimodal models. Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer a strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In this survey, we offer a systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency. Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally, we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey presents a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI systems.

Abstract: Neurological conditions affecting visual perception create profound experiential divides between affected individuals and their caregivers, families, and medical professionals. We present the Perceptual Reality Transformer, a comprehensive framework employing six distinct neural architectures to simulate eight neurological perception conditions with scientifically-grounded visual transformations. Our system learns mappings from natural images to condition-specific perceptual states, enabling others to experience approximations of simultanagnosia, prosopagnosia, ADHD attention deficits, visual agnosia, depression-related changes, anxiety tunnel vision, and Alzheimer's memory effects. Through systematic evaluation across ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures achieve optimal performance, outperforming traditional CNN and generative approaches. Our work establishes the first systematic benchmark for neurological perception simulation, contributes novel condition-specific perturbation functions grounded in clinical literature, and provides quantitative metrics for evaluating simulation fidelity. The framework has immediate applications in medical education, empathy training, and assistive technology development, while advancing our fundamental understanding of how neural networks can model atypical human perception.

Abstract: Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human and robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such as human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies, focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a leading modality for the diagnosis of liver cancer, significantly improving the classification of the lesion and patient outcomes. However, traditional MRI faces challenges including risks from contrast agent (CA) administration, time-consuming manual assessment, and limited annotated datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a Time-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for synthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from non-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a conditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and temporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic time-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase information flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth and physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a constraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion classification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further enhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent liver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework offers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional contrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and reliability for the assessment of liver lesion. The implementation of T-CACE is publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/T-CACE.

In this work, we introduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and coding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation abilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary models like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging strategy and new datasets.

Abstract: The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision models, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications. Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time optimization at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Thanks to the large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, we can craft a zero-shot classifier by "prompt", e.g., the confidence score of an image being "[CLASS]" can be obtained by using the VLM provided similarity measure between the image and the prompt sentence "a photo of a [CLASS]". Therefore, prompt shows a great potential for fast adaptation of VLMs to downstream tasks if we fine-tune the prompt-based similarity measure. However, we find a common failure that improper fine-tuning may not only undermine the prompt's inherent prediction for the task-related classes, but also for other classes in the VLM vocabulary. Existing methods still address this problem by using traditional anti-overfitting techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation, which lack a principled solution specific to prompt. We present Prompt-aligned Gradient, dubbed ProGrad, to prevent prompt tuning from forgetting the the general knowledge learned from VLMs. In particular, ProGrad only updates the prompt whose gradient is aligned (or non-conflicting) to the "general direction", which is represented as the gradient of the KL loss of the pre-defined prompt prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the stronger few-shot generalization ability of ProGrad over state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/BeierZhu/Prompt-align.

Abstract: We present a new paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale visionlanguage pre-trained models on downstream task, dubbed Prompt Regularization (ProReg). Different from traditional fine-tuning which easily overfits to the downstream task data, ProReg uses the prediction by prompting the pretrained model to regularize the fine-tuning. The motivation is: by prompting the large model "a photo of a [CLASS]", the fil-lin answer is only dependent on the pretraining encyclopedic knowledge while independent of the task data distribution, which is usually biased. Specifically, given a training sample prediction during fine-tuning, we first calculate its KullbackLeibler loss of the prompt prediction and Cross-Entropy loss of the ground-truth label, and then combine them with a proposed sample-wise adaptive trade-off weight, which automatically adjusts the transfer between the pretrained and downstream domains. On various out-of-distribution benchmarks, we show the consistently strong performance of ProReg compared with conventional fine-tuning, zero-shot prompt, prompt tuning, and other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection systems for ear diseases, powered by deep learning, are essential for preventing hearing impairment and improving population health. However, the limited diversity of existing otoendoscopy datasets and the poor balance between diagnostic accuracy, computational efficiency, and model size have hindered the translation of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms into healthcare applications. In this study, we constructed a large-scale, multi-center otoendoscopy dataset covering eight common ear diseases and healthy cases. Building upon this resource, we developed Best-EarNet, an ultrafast and lightweight deep learning architecture integrating a novel Local-Global Spatial Feature Fusion Module with a multi-scale supervision strategy, enabling real-time and accurate classification of ear conditions. Leveraging transfer learning, Best-EarNet, with a model size of only 2.94 MB, achieved diagnostic accuracies of 95.23% on an internal test set (22,581 images) and 92.14% on an external test set (1,652 images), while requiring only 0.0125 seconds (80 frames per second) to process a single image on a standard CPU. Further subgroup analysis by gender and age showed consistently excellent performance of Best-EarNet across all demographic groups. To enhance clinical interpretability and user trust, we incorporated Grad-CAM-based visualization, highlighting the specific abnormal ear regions contributing to AI predictions. Most importantly, we developed Ear-Keeper, a cross-platform intelligent diagnosis system built upon Best-EarNet, deployable on smartphones, tablets, and personal computers. Ear-Keeper enables public users and healthcare providers to perform comprehensive real-time video-based ear canal screening, supporting early detection and timely intervention of ear diseases.

Abstract: In IoT based distributed network of cameras, real-time multi-camera video analytics is challenged by high bandwidth demands and redundant visual data, creating a fundamental tension where reducing data saves network overhead but can degrade model performance, and vice versa. We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.

Abstract: Determining when people are struggling allows for a finer-grained understanding of actions that complements conventional action classification and error detection. Struggle detection, as defined in this paper, is a distinct and important task that can be identified without explicit step or activity knowledge. We introduce the first struggle dataset with three real-world problem-solving activities that are labelled by both expert and crowd-source annotators. Video segments were scored w.r.t. their level of struggle using a forced choice 4-point scale. This dataset contains 5.1 hours of video from 73 participants. We conducted a series of experiments to identify the most suitable modelling approaches for struggle determination. Additionally, we compared various deep learning models, establishing baseline results for struggle classification, struggle regression, and struggle label distribution learning. Our results indicate that struggle detection in video can achieve up to $88.24\%$ accuracy in binary classification, while detecting the level of struggle in a four-way classification setting performs lower, with an overall accuracy of $52.45\%$. Our work is motivated toward a more comprehensive understanding of action in video and potentially the improvement of assistive systems that analyse struggle and can better support users during manual activities.

Abstract: Scribble supervision has emerged as a promising approach for reducing annotation costs in medical 3D segmentation by leveraging sparse annotations instead of voxel-wise labels. While existing methods report strong performance, a closer analysis reveals that the majority of research is confined to the cardiac domain, predominantly using ACDC and MSCMR datasets. This over-specialization has resulted in severe overfitting, misleading claims of performance improvements, and a lack of generalization across broader segmentation tasks. In this work, we formulate a set of key requirements for practical scribble supervision and introduce ScribbleBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning over seven diverse medical imaging datasets, to systematically evaluate the fulfillment of these requirements. Consequently, we uncover a general failure of methods to generalize across tasks and that many widely used novelties degrade performance outside of the cardiac domain, whereas simpler overlooked approaches achieve superior generalization. Finally, we raise awareness for a strong yet overlooked baseline, nnU-Net coupled with a partial loss, which consistently outperforms specialized methods across a diverse range of tasks. By identifying fundamental limitations in existing research and establishing a new benchmark-driven evaluation standard, this work aims to steer scribble supervision toward more practical, robust, and generalizable methodologies for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is a non-intrusive privacy and relatively convenient and inexpensive device, which has been demonstrated to be applicable in place of RGB cameras in human indoor pose estimation tasks. However, mmWave radar relies on the collection of reflected signals from the target, and the radar signals containing information is difficult to be fully applied. This has been a long-standing hindrance to the improvement of pose estimation accuracy. To address this major challenge, this paper introduces a probability map guided multi-format feature fusion model, ProbRadarM3F. This is a novel radar feature extraction framework using a traditional FFT method in parallel with a probability map based positional encoding method. ProbRadarM3F fuses the traditional heatmap features and the positional features, then effectively achieves the estimation of 14 keypoints of the human body. Experimental evaluation on the HuPR dataset proves the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper, outperforming other methods experimented on this dataset with an AP of 69.9 %. The emphasis of our study is focusing on the position information that is not exploited before in radar singal. This provides direction to investigate other potential non-redundant information from mmWave rader.

Abstract: Video processing is generally divided into two main categories: processing of the entire video, which typically yields optimal classification outcomes, and real-time processing, where the objective is to make a decision as promptly as possible. Although the models dedicated to the processing of entire videos are typically well-defined and clearly presented in the literature, this is not the case for online processing, where a~plethora of hand-devised methods exist. To address this issue, we present PrAViC, a novel, unified, and theoretically-based adaptation framework for tackling the online classification problem in video data. The initial phase of our study is to establish a mathematical background for the classification of sequential data, with the potential to make a decision at an early stage. This allows us to construct a natural function that encourages the model to return a result much faster. The subsequent phase is to present a straightforward and readily implementable method for adapting offline models to the online setting using recurrent operations. Finally, PrAViC is evaluated by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art offline and online models and datasets. This enables the network to significantly reduce the time required to reach classification decisions while maintaining, or even enhancing, accuracy.

<title>Integrating Clinical Knowledge Graphs and Gradient-Based Neural Systems for Enhanced Melanoma Diagnosis via the 7-Point Checklist</title>

Abstract: The 7-point checklist (7PCL) is a widely used diagnostic tool in dermoscopy for identifying malignant melanoma by assigning point values to seven specific attributes. However, the traditional 7PCL is limited to distinguishing between malignant melanoma and melanocytic Nevi, and falls short in scenarios where multiple skin diseases with appearances similar to melanoma coexist. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diagnostic framework that integrates a clinical knowledge-based topological graph (CKTG) with a gradient diagnostic strategy featuring a data-driven weighting system (GD-DDW). The CKTG captures both the internal and external relationships among the 7PCL attributes, while the GD-DDW emulates dermatologists' diagnostic processes, prioritizing visual observation before making predictions. Additionally, we introduce a multimodal feature extraction approach leveraging a dual-attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction through cross-modal interaction and unimodal collaboration. This method incorporates meta-information to uncover interactions between clinical data and image features, ensuring more accurate and robust predictions. Our approach, evaluated on the EDRA dataset, achieved an average AUC of 88.6%, demonstrating superior performance in melanoma detection and feature prediction. This integrated system provides data-driven benchmarks for clinicians, significantly enhancing the precision of melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is hard, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build on well-established components to construct a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in "stone" weights.

Abstract: Foundation models have triggered a paradigm shift in computer vision and are increasingly being adopted in remote sensing, particularly for multispectral imagery. Yet, their potential in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) remains untapped due to the absence of comprehensive and globally representative hyperspectral datasets. To close this gap, we introduce SpectralEarth, a large-scale multitemporal dataset designed to pretrain hyperspectral foundation models leveraging data from the environmental mapping and analysis program (EnMAP). SpectralEarth comprises 538 974 image patches covering 415 153 unique locations from 11 636 globally distributed EnMAP scenes spanning two years of archive. In addition, 17.5% of these locations include multiple timestamps, enabling multitemporal HSI analysis. Utilizing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning algorithms, we pretrain a series of foundation models on SpectralEarth, integrating a spectral adapter into classical vision backbones to accommodate the unique characteristics of HSI. In tandem, we construct nine downstream datasets for land-cover, crop-type mapping, and tree-species classification, providing benchmarks for model evaluation. Experimental results support the versatility of our models and their generalizability across different tasks and sensors. We also highlight computational efficiency during model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation methods have shown promising results in medical image segmentation, significantly reducing annotation costs. However, existing approaches often rely on auxiliary tasks to enforce semantic consistency and use hard pseudo labels for supervision, overlooking the unique challenges faced by models trained with sparse annotations. These models must predict pixel-wise segmentation maps from limited data, making it crucial to handle varying levels of annotation richness effectively. In this paper, we propose MaCo, a weakly supervised model designed for medical image segmentation, based on the principle of "from few to more." MaCo leverages Masked Context Modeling (MCM) and Continuous Pseudo Labels (CPL). MCM employs an attention-based masking strategy to perturb the input image, ensuring that the model's predictions align with those of the original image. CPL converts scribble annotations into continuous pixel-wise labels by applying an exponential decay function to distance maps, producing confidence maps that represent the likelihood of each pixel belonging to a specific category, rather than relying on hard pseudo labels. We evaluate MaCo on three public datasets, comparing it with other weakly supervised methods. Our results show that MaCo outperforms competing methods across all datasets, establishing a new record in weakly supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Dual encoder architectures like Clip models map two types of inputs into a shared embedding space and predict similarities between them. Despite their wide application, it is, however, not understood how these models compare their two inputs. Common first-order feature-attribution methods explain importances of individual features and can, thus, only provide limited insights into dual encoders, whose predictions depend on interactions between features. In this paper, we first derive a second-order method enabling the attribution of predictions by any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to Clip models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes and also account for mismatches. This intrinsic visual-linguistic grounding ability, however, varies heavily between object classes, exhibits pronounced out-of-domain effects and we can identify individual errors as well as systematic failure categories.

Abstract: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and young adults, but the scarcity of large histopathology datasets has limited the application of computational pathology in this group. This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often face a modality representation gap during pretraining: while language embeddings remain stable, visual representations are highly sensitive to contextual noise (e.g., background clutter). To address this issue, we introduce a visual comprehension stage, which we call ViCToR (Visual Comprehension via Token Reconstruction), a novel pretraining framework for LMMs. ViCToR employs a learnable visual token pool and utilizes the Hungarian matching algorithm to select semantically relevant tokens from this pool for visual token replacement. Furthermore, by integrating a visual token reconstruction loss with dense semantic supervision, ViCToR can learn tokens which retain high visual detail, thereby enhancing the large language model's (LLM's) understanding of visual information. After pretraining on 3 million publicly accessible images and captions, ViCToR achieves state-of-the-art results, improving over LLaVA-NeXT-8B by 10.4%, 3.2%, and 7.2% on the MMStar, SEED$^I$, and RealWorldQA benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Existing unsupervised keypoint detection methods apply artificial deformations to images such as masking a significant portion of images and using reconstruction of original image as a learning objective to detect keypoints. However, this approach lacks depth information in the image and often detects keypoints on the background. To address this, we propose Distill-DKP, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages depth maps and RGB images for keypoint detection in a self-supervised setting. During training, Distill-DKP extracts embedding-level knowledge from a depth-based teacher model to guide an image-based student model with inference restricted to the student. Experiments show that Distill-DKP significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods by reducing mean L2 error by 47.15% on Human3.6M, mean average error by 5.67% on Taichi, and improving keypoints accuracy by 1.3% on DeepFashion dataset. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate the sensitivity of knowledge distillation across different layers of the network. Project Page: https://23wm13.github.io/distill-dkp/

Abstract: Outdoor images often suffer from severe degradation due to rain, haze, and noise, impairing image quality and challenging high-level tasks. Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks. The source code will be available at https://github.com/House-yuyu/MDDA-former.

Existing methods struggle to generalize due to differences in dataset labeling, where changes such as vegetation growth or lane marking alterations may be labeled as relevant in one dataset and irrelevant in another. To resolve this ambiguity, we propose ViewDelta, a text conditioned change detection framework that uses natural language prompts to define relevant changes precisely, such as a single attribute, a specific set of classes, or all observable differences. To facilitate training in this paradigm, we release the Conditional Change Segmentation dataset (CSeg), the first large-scale synthetic dataset for text conditioned SCD, consisting of over 500,000 image pairs with more than 300,000 unique textual prompts describing relevant changes. Experiments demonstrate that a single ViewDelta model trained jointly on CSeg, SYSU-CD, PSCD, VL-CMU-CD, and their unaligned variants achieves performance competitive with or superior to dataset specific models, highlighting text conditioning as a powerful approach for generalizable SCD. Our code and dataset are available at https://joshuakgao.github.io/viewdelta/.

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation has great potential in autonomous driving and robotics due to the advantages of event cameras, such as high dynamic range, low latency, and low power cost. Unfortunately, current artificial neural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational demands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption, limiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile platforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven lightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature interaction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with binary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS inference speed. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/longxianlei/SLTNet-v1.0.

Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulators solve the wave equation to model pressure distribution fields, achieving high accuracy but requiring significant computational time and resources. To address this, ray tracing approaches have been introduced, modeling wave propagation as rays interacting with boundaries and scatterers. However, existing models simplify ray propagation, generating echoes at interaction points without considering return paths to the sensor. This can result in unrealistic artifacts and necessitates careful scene tuning for plausible results. We propose a novel ultrasound simulation pipeline that utilizes a ray tracing algorithm to generate echo data, tracing each ray from the transducer through the scene and back to the sensor. To replicate advanced ultrasound imaging, we introduce a ray emission scheme optimized for plane wave imaging, incorporating delay and steering capabilities. Furthermore, we integrate a standard signal processing pipeline to simulate end-to-end ultrasound image formation. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed pipeline by modeling synthetic scenes featuring highly reflective objects, such as bones. In doing so, our proposed approach, UltraRay, not only enhances the overall visual quality but also improves the realism of the simulated images by accurately capturing secondary reflections and reducing unnatural artifacts. By building on top of a differentiable framework, the proposed pipeline lays the groundwork for a fast and differentiable ultrasound simulation tool necessary for gradient-based optimization, enabling advanced ultrasound beamforming strategies, neural network integration, and accurate inverse scene reconstruction.

Abstract: From a simple text prompt, generative-AI image models can create stunningly realistic and creative images bounded, it seems, by only our imagination. These models have achieved this remarkable feat thanks, in part, to the ingestion of billions of images collected from nearly every corner of the internet. Many creators have understandably expressed concern over how their intellectual property has been ingested without their permission or a mechanism to opt out of training. As a result, questions of fair use and copyright infringement have quickly emerged. We describe a method that allows us to determine if a model was trained on a specific image or set of images. This method is computationally efficient and assumes no explicit knowledge of the model architecture or weights (so-called black-box membership inference). We anticipate that this method will be crucial for auditing existing models and, looking ahead, ensuring the fairer development and deployment of generative AI models.

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have become essential for autonomous driving by enabling future scene prediction. However, existing DWMs are limited to scene generation and fail to incorporate scene understanding, which involves interpreting and reasoning about the driving environment. In this paper, we present a unified Driving World Model named HERMES. We seamlessly integrate 3D scene understanding and future scene evolution (generation) through a unified framework in driving scenarios. Specifically, HERMES leverages a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation to consolidate multi-view spatial information while preserving geometric relationships and interactions. We also introduce world queries, which incorporate world knowledge into BEV features via causal attention in the Large Language Model, enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive studies on nuScenes and OmniDrive-nuScenes datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing generation error by 32.4% and improving understanding metrics such as CIDEr by 8.0%. The model and code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMD0311/HERMES.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) measures and predicts perceived image quality by human observers. Although recent studies have highlighted the critical influence that variations in the scale of an image have on its perceived quality, this relationship has not been systematically quantified. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Image Intrinsic Scale (IIS), defined as the largest scale where an image exhibits its highest perceived quality. We also present the Image Intrinsic Scale Assessment (IISA) task, which involves subjectively measuring and predicting the IIS based on human judgments. We develop a subjective annotation methodology and create the IISA-DB dataset, comprising 785 image-IIS pairs annotated by experts in a rigorously controlled crowdsourcing study. Furthermore, we propose WIISA (Weak-labeling for Image Intrinsic Scale Assessment), a strategy that leverages how the IIS of an image varies with downscaling to generate weak labels. Experiments show that applying WIISA during the training of several IQA methods adapted for IISA consistently improves the performance compared to using only ground-truth labels. The code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/SonyResearch/IISA.

Abstract: Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.

Abstract: Styled motion in-betweening is crucial for computer animation and gaming. However, existing methods typically encode motion styles by modeling whole-body motions, often overlooking the representation of individual body parts. This limitation reduces the flexibility of infilled motion, particularly in adjusting the motion styles of specific limbs independently. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework that models motion styles at the body-part level, enhancing both the diversity and controllability of infilled motions. Our approach enables more nuanced and expressive animations by allowing precise modifications to individual limb motions while maintaining overall motion coherence. Leveraging phase-related insights, our framework employs periodic autoencoders to automatically extract the phase of each body part, capturing distinctive local style features. Additionally, we effectively decouple the motion source from synthesis control by integrating motion manifold learning and conditional generation techniques from both image and motion domains. This allows the motion source to generate high-quality motions across various styles, with extracted motion and style features readily available for controlled synthesis in subsequent tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior speed, robust generalization, and effective generation of extended motion sequences.

<title>GranQ: Granular Zero-Shot Quantization with Channel-Wise Activation Scaling in QAT</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization (ZSQ) enables neural network compression without original training data, making it a promising solution for restricted data access scenarios. To compensate for the lack of data, recent ZSQ methods typically rely on synthetic inputs generated from the full-precision model. However, these synthetic inputs often lead to activation distortion, especially under low-bit settings. To mitigate this, existing methods typically employ per-channel scaling, but they still struggle due to the severe computational overhead during the accumulation process. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we propose GranQ, a novel activation quantization framework that introduces an efficient pre-scaling strategy. Unlike conventional channel-wise methods that repeatedly perform scaling operations during accumulation, GranQ applies scaling factors in a pre-scaling step through fully vectorized computation, eliminating runtime scaling overhead. This design enables GranQ to maintain fine-grained quantization accuracy while significantly reducing computational burden, particularly in low-bit quantization settings. Extensive experiments under quantization-aware training (QAT) settings demonstrate that GranQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ZSQ methods across CIFAR and ImageNet. In particular, our method achieves up to 5.45% higher accuracy in the 3-bit setting on CIFAR-100 and even surpasses the full-precision baseline on CIFAR-10. Furthermore, GranQ achieves significant speedup in quantization latency over conventional per-channel methods, demonstrating improved efficiency. With these findings, we anticipate that GranQ will inspire future research beyond conventional ZSQ approaches centered on data generation and model fine-tuning. The official code is available at https://github.com/anonymus-orange/GranQ.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have highlighted their potential for multi-modal understanding, yet evaluating their factual grounding in videos remains a critical unsolved challenge. To address this gap, we introduce Video SimpleQA, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for factuality evaluation in video contexts. Our work differs from existing video benchmarks through the following key features: 1) Knowledge required: demanding integration of external knowledge beyond the video's explicit narrative; 2) Multi-hop fact-seeking question: Each question involves multiple explicit facts and requires strict factual grounding without hypothetical or subjective inferences. We also include per-hop single-fact-based sub-QAs alongside final QAs to enable fine-grained, stepby-step evaluation; 3) Short-form definitive answer: Answers are crafted as unambiguous and definitively correct in a short format with minimal scoring variance; 4) Temporal grounded required: Requiring answers to rely on one or more temporal segments in videos, rather than single frames. We extensively evaluate 33 state-of-the-art LVLMs and summarize key findings as follows: 1) Current LVLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in factual adherence, with the best-performing model o3 merely achieving an F-score of 66.3%; 2) Most LVLMs are overconfident in what they generate, with self-stated confidence exceeding actual accuracy; 3) Retrieval-augmented generation demonstrates consistent improvements at the cost of additional inference time overhead; 4) Multi-hop QA demonstrates substantially degraded performance compared to single-hop sub-QAs, with first-hop object or event recognition emerging as the primary bottleneck. We position Video SimpleQA as the cornerstone benchmark for video factuality assessment, aiming to steer LVLM development toward verifiable grounding in real-world contexts.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves impressive quality and rendering speed, but with millions of 3D Gaussians and significant storage and transmission costs. In this paper, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method called NeuralGS that compresses the original 3DGS into a compact representation. Our observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes. Thus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even for a large-scale scene. To achieve this, we adopt a clustering strategy and fit the Gaussians within each cluster using different tiny MLPs, based on importance scores of Gaussians as fitting weights. We experiment on multiple datasets, achieving a 91-times average model size reduction without harming the visual quality.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of 3D generation, achieving controllability, i.e., ensuring consistency between generated 3D content and input conditions like edge and depth, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often struggle to maintain accurate alignment, leading to noticeable discrepancies. To address this issue, we propose \name{}, a new framework that enhances controllable 3D generation by explicitly encouraging cyclic consistency between the second-order 3D content, generated based on extracted signals from the first-order generation, and its original input controls. Specifically, we employ an efficient feed-forward backbone that can generate a 3D object from an input condition and a text prompt. Given an initial viewpoint and a control signal, a novel view is rendered from the generated 3D content, from which the extracted condition is used to regenerate the 3D content. This re-generated output is then rendered back to the initial viewpoint, followed by another round of control signal extraction, forming a cyclic process with two consistency constraints. \emph{View consistency} ensures coherence between the two generated 3D objects, measured by semantic similarity to accommodate generative diversity. \emph{Condition consistency} aligns the final extracted signal with the original input control, preserving structural or geometric details throughout the process. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that \name{} significantly improves controllability, especially for fine-grained details, outperforming existing methods across various conditions (e.g., +14.17\% PSNR for edge, +6.26\% PSNR for sketch).

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS) remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding, and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one private farmland plot dataset, containing 27,247 QA pairs and 19,615 images. The pipeline begins with multi-source data pre-processing, including collection, format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 20 open-source LMMs and 4 closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical challenges for future work.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within image generation via the transformer architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global modeling transformers, which face significant quadratic computational cost. However, through empirical analysis, we find that DiTs do not rely as heavily on global information as previously believed. In fact, most layers exhibit significant redundancy in global computation. Additionally, conventional attention mechanisms suffer from low-frequency inertia, limiting their efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Pseudo Shifted Window Attention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global attention redundancy. PSWA achieves moderate global-local information through window attention. It further utilizes a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, which both enrich the high-frequency information and strengthen inter-window connections. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation (PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention without additional computational cost. Based on these innovations, we propose a series of Pseudo Progressive Diffusion Transformer (PiT). Our extensive experiments show their superior performance; for example, our proposed PiT-L achieves 54% FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while using less computation.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to Transformer-based architectures, offering linear complexity in sequence length while maintaining strong modeling capacity. However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection, demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous Mamba-based backbones, with particularly notable gains under high-resolution settings.

Abstract: Synthetic X-ray angiographies generated by modern generative models hold great potential to reduce the use of contrast agents in vascular interventional procedures. However, low-quality synthetic angiographies can significantly increase procedural risk, underscoring the need for reliable image quality assessment (IQA) methods. Existing IQA models, however, fail to leverage auxiliary images as references during evaluation and lack fine-grained, task-specific metrics necessary for clinical relevance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CAS-IQA, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework that predicts fine-grained quality scores by effectively incorporating auxiliary information from related images. In the absence of angiography datasets, CAS-3K is constructed, comprising 3,565 synthetic angiographies along with score annotations. To ensure clinically meaningful assessment, three task-specific evaluation metrics are defined. Furthermore, a Multi-path featUre fuSion and rouTing (MUST) module is designed to enhance image representations by adaptively fusing and routing visual tokens to metric-specific branches. Extensive experiments on the CAS-3K dataset demonstrate that CAS-IQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA methods by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Human pose estimation based on Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a promising approach for non-intrusive and precise human activity monitoring, yet faces challenges including accurate multi-person pose recognition and effective CSI feature learning. This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion. Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.

<title>MGDFIS: Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy for Small Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we address Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation (SSS) under domain shift by leveraging domain-invariant semantic knowledge from text embeddings of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We propose a unified Hierarchical Vision-Language framework (HVL) that integrates domain-invariant text embeddings as object queries in a transformer-based segmentation network to improve generalization and reduce misclassification under limited supervision. The mentioned textual queries are used for grouping pixels with shared semantics under SSS. HVL is designed to (1) generate textual queries that maximally encode domain-invariant semantics from VLM while capturing intra-class variations; (2) align these queries with spatial visual features to enhance their segmentation ability and improve the semantic clarity of visual features. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision--language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic understanding. HVL establishes a novel state-of-the-art by achieving a +9.3% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on COCO, utilizing 232 labelled images, +3.1% on Pascal VOC employing 92 labels, +4.8% on ADE20 using 316 labels, and +3.4% on Cityscapes with 100 labels, demonstrating superior performance with less than 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets. Our results show that language-guided segmentation bridges the label efficiency gap and enables new levels of fine-grained generalization.

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However, conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP (OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all categories on SemanticKITTI.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking and GLM-4.5V, a family of vision-language models (VLMs) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V.

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available at:https://github.com/TRLou/PGA.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the need for expensive manual annotations. Intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and 3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available online.

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR) framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration, grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark. In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs, neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants, these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module, which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold, regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions, we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes, effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions, leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with environmental variability, occlusions, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes 20 corruption types based on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the HOI field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic and partial cues, thus dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection. Benchmarks, datasets, and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Kratos-Wen/RoHOI.

<title>Advancing Reliable Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models under Visual Variations</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under real-world distribution shifts. Code: https://github.com/Evelyn1ywliang/ReTA.

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions. Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution images through cropping, integrating local and global features for multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and 3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2) mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality, physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals, promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face similarity.

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths: monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision, while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce a unified framework that bridges both through iterative bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning. This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results: \textbf{it reduces zero-shot generalization error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view geometry with monocular context, our approach enables robust 3D perception that transcends modality-specific limitations.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate BRDF acquisition of real world materials is a challenging research problem that requires sampling millions of incident light and viewing directions. To accelerate the acquisition process, one needs to find a minimal set of sampling directions such that the recovery of the full BRDF is accurate and robust given such samples. In this paper, we formulate BRDF acquisition as a compressed sensing problem, where the sensing operator is one that performs sub-sampling of the BRDF signal according to a set of optimal sample directions. To solve this problem, we propose the Fast and Robust Optimal Sampling Technique (FROST) for designing a provably optimal sub-sampling operator that places light-view samples such that the recovery error is minimized. FROST casts the problem of designing an optimal sub-sampling operator for compressed sensing into a sparse representation formulation under the Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) signal model. The proposed reformulation is exact, i.e. without any approximations, hence it converts an intractable combinatorial problem into one that can be solved with standard optimization techniques. As a result, FROST is accompanied by strong theoretical guarantees from the field of compressed sensing. We perform a thorough analysis of FROST-BRDF using a 10-fold cross-validation with publicly available BRDF datasets and show significant advantages compared to the state-of-the-art with respect to reconstruction quality. Finally, FROST is simple, both conceptually and in terms of implementation, it produces consistent results at each run, and it is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the prior art.

Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Deep Learning enhances decision-making by integrating diverse information sources, such as texts, images, audio, and videos. To develop trustworthy multimodal approaches, it is essential to understand how uncertainty impacts these models. We propose LUMA, a unique multimodal dataset, featuring audio, image, and textual data from 50 classes, specifically designed for learning from uncertain data. It extends the well-known CIFAR 10/100 dataset with audio samples extracted from three audio corpora, and text data generated using the Gemma-7B Large Language Model (LLM). The LUMA dataset enables the controlled injection of varying types and degrees of uncertainty to achieve and tailor specific experiments and benchmarking initiatives. LUMA is also available as a Python package including the functions for generating multiple variants of the dataset with controlling the diversity of the data, the amount of noise for each modality, and adding out-of-distribution samples. A baseline pre-trained model is also provided alongside three uncertainty quantification methods: Monte-Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensemble, and Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning. This comprehensive dataset and its tools are intended to promote and support the development, evaluation, and benchmarking of trustworthy and robust multimodal deep learning approaches. We anticipate that the LUMA dataset will help the research community to design more trustworthy and robust machine learning approaches for safety critical applications. The code and instructions for downloading and processing the dataset can be found at: https://github.com/bezirganyan/LUMA/ .

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, which can be further augmented by integrating a pre-trained vision model into the original LLM to create a multimodal LLM (MLLM). However, this integration often significantly decreases performance on natural language understanding and generation tasks, compared to the original LLM. This study investigates this issue using the LLaVA MLLM, treating the integration as a continual learning problem. We evaluate five continual learning methods to mitigate forgetting and identify a technique that enhances visual understanding while minimizing linguistic performance loss. Our approach reduces linguistic performance degradation by up to 15% over the LLaVA recipe, while maintaining high multimodal accuracy. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method through continual learning on a sequence of vision-language tasks, effectively preserving linguistic skills while acquiring new multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have reached remarkable levels of proficiency in understanding multimodal inputs. However, understanding and interpreting the behavior of such complex models is a challenging task, not to mention the dynamic shifts that may occur during fine-tuning, or due to covariate shift between datasets. In this work, we apply concept-level analysis towards MLLM understanding. More specifically, we propose to map hidden states to interpretable visual and textual concepts. This enables us to more efficiently compare certain semantic dynamics, such as the shift from an original and fine-tuned model, revealing concept alteration and potential biases that may occur during fine-tuning. We also demonstrate the use of shift vectors to capture these concepts changes. These shift vectors allow us to recover fine-tuned concepts by applying simple, computationally inexpensive additive concept shifts in the original model. Finally, our findings also have direct applications for MLLM steering, which can be used for model debiasing as well as enforcing safety in MLLM output. All in all, we propose a novel, training-free, ready-to-use framework for MLLM behavior interpretability and control. Our implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-assisted medical imaging analysis demonstrates remarkable performance in early lung cancer screening. However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4$\times$, 3.1$\times$, and 29.5$\times$ better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a Dice Coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8% and 18.6% improvements in Dice and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.

Abstract: Robust grasping in cluttered environments remains an open challenge in robotics. While benchmark datasets have significantly advanced deep learning methods, they mainly focus on simplistic scenes with light occlusion and insufficient diversity, limiting their applicability to practical scenarios. We present GraspClutter6D, a large-scale real-world grasping dataset featuring: (1) 1,000 highly cluttered scenes with dense arrangements (14.1 objects/scene, 62.6\% occlusion), (2) comprehensive coverage across 200 objects in 75 environment configurations (bins, shelves, and tables) captured using four RGB-D cameras from multiple viewpoints, and (3) rich annotations including 736K 6D object poses and 9.3B feasible robotic grasps for 52K RGB-D images. We benchmark state-of-the-art segmentation, object pose estimation, and grasp detection methods to provide key insights into challenges in cluttered environments. Additionally, we validate the dataset's effectiveness as a training resource, demonstrating that grasping networks trained on GraspClutter6D significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets in both simulation and real-world experiments. The dataset, toolkit, and annotation tools are publicly available on our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/graspclutter6d.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.

Abstract: Personalized image generation is crucial for improving the user experience, as it renders reference images into preferred ones according to user visual preferences. Although effective, existing methods face two main issues. First, existing methods treat all items in the user historical sequence equally when extracting user preferences, overlooking the varying semantic similarities between historical items and the reference item. Disproportionately high weights for low-similarity items distort users' visual preferences for the reference item. Second, existing methods heavily rely on consistency between generated and reference images to optimize the generation, which leads to underfitting user preferences and hinders personalization. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval Augment Personalized Image GenerAtion guided by Recommendation (RAGAR). Our approach uses a retrieval mechanism to assign different weights to historical items according to their similarities to the reference item, thereby extracting more refined users' visual preferences for the reference item. Then we introduce a novel rank task based on the multi-modal ranking model to optimize the personalization of the generated images instead of forcing depend on consistency. Extensive experiments and human evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAR achieves significant improvements in both personalization and semantic metrics compared to five baselines.

Abstract: Accurate emotion understanding in videos necessitates effectively recognizing and interpreting emotional states by integrating visual, textual, auditory, and contextual cues. Although recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have exhibited significant progress in general vision-language (VL) tasks, their performance often deteriorates in emotion-specific scenarios, exhibiting catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on emotion-centric tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose Emotion-Qwen, a unified multimodal framework designed to simultaneously enable robust emotion understanding and preserve general VL reasoning capabilities. Emotion-Qwen introduces a novel Hybrid Compressor based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, dynamically routing inputs to optimally balance emotion-specific processing and general multimodal reasoning. We further propose a carefully structured three-stage pre-training pipeline, leveraging extensive general and emotion-focused datasets to strengthen multimodal representation robustness and model adaptability. Additionally, we develop the Video Emotion Reasoning (VER) dataset, a large-scale bilingual resource containing over 40K video clips annotated with detailed context-aware emotional descriptions, significantly facilitating research on fine-grained emotional reasoning. Extensive experiments confirm that Emotion-Qwen achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple emotion recognition and reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive results in general VL tasks.

Designed for efficient semantic mapping and adaptability to changing environments, DualMap meets the essential requirements for real-world robot navigation applications. Our proposed hybrid segmentation frontend and object-level status check eliminate the costly 3D object merging required by prior methods, enabling efficient online scene mapping. The dual-map representation combines a global abstract map for high-level candidate selection with a local concrete map for precise goal-reaching, effectively managing and updating dynamic changes in the environment. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, efficient scene mapping, and online language-guided navigation.Project page: https://eku127.github.io/DualMap/

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking. Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present Garment Inertial Poser (GaIP), a method for estimating full-body poses from sparse and loosely attached IMU sensors. We first simulate IMU recordings using an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. Our transformer-based diffusion models synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses from this challenging loose IMU data. We also demonstrate that incorporating garment-related parameters during training on loose IMU data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Our experiments show that our diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperform state-of-the-art inertial full-body pose estimators, both quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research on motion capture from such realistic sensor placements.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components. First, we introduce (i) Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an (ii) Audio-Guided Attention module that models the interactions between target candidates and mentioned objects, enhancing discrimination in cluttered 3D environments. To support benchmarking, we (iii) synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods, highlight the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher verification rates.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring. However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance, irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset. FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672, and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate, explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable, high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving real-world wound assessment and patient care.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories: hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches, modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining promising directions for future research.

<div> Keywords: drug-drug interactions, deep learning, molecular motif sequence, molecular image information, adaptive feature fusion

Summary: 
The paper introduces ImageDDI, a framework for predicting drug-drug interactions using deep learning. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by focusing on functional motif-based representation learning. ImageDDI tokenizes molecules into motifs and combines them into sequences for representation. It utilizes a transformer-based encoder to embed these motifs, starting from local structure representation. Global molecular image information is incorporated to enhance spatial representation, and Adaptive Feature Fusion dynamically adapts feature fusion. Experimental results show ImageDDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction. It achieves competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced scenarios. The framework shows promise in accurately identifying and predicting drug interactions, crucial for mitigating potential health risks associated with multi-drug use.

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for \textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder, starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g. texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations. Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced scenarios compared to other models.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment. Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field: https://github.com/christophezei/Optimizing-Object-Detection-Models-for-TinyML-A-Comprehensive-Survey.

<div> Keywords: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks, energy-efficient, image classification, segmentation, Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation

Summary:
Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) with optical frontend and digital backend offer an energy-efficient solution for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, challenges such as accuracy gap and discrepancies between simulated and fabricated systems limit their adoption. A task-agnostic and hardware-agnostic pipeline is proposed to support image classification and segmentation across diverse optical systems. Before training, achievable model accuracy can be estimated based on physical constraints and datasets. Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD) aligns optical models with electronic teacher networks, reducing the accuracy gap during training. NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend post-fabrication to compensate for implementation errors. Experimental results on various datasets and hardware configurations demonstrate consistent improvement in ONN performance, enabling practical deployment in both simulations and physical implementations.

arXiv:2508.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.

<div> Keywords: virtual try-on, multi-garment diffusion, identity preservation, fashion retail, pose cues 

Summary: 
MuGa-VTON introduces a multi-garment diffusion framework for virtual try-on applications, combining upper and lower garments with person identity in a shared latent space. The Garment Representation Module captures garment semantics, the Person Representation Module encodes identity and pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module integrates features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture supports prompt-based customization for fine-grained garment modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual try-on applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization. However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately, rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual try-on applications.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel diffusion-based architecture called Concurrent Object Layers (CObL) for inferring a scene representation consisting of occlusion-ordered object layers from images. CObL generates isolated and amodally-completed objects in parallel, utilizing Stable Diffusion as a prior and inference-time guidance to ensure accurate reconstruction back to the input image. Trained on synthetic images of tabletop scenes, CObL demonstrates zero-shot generalization to real-world photographs with varying numbers of novel objects. CObL reconstructs multiple occluded objects without user input and without prior knowledge of the number of objects present. Unlike existing models, CObL is not limited to the training world, showcasing its versatility in object-centric representation learning.

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers," each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

<div> Annotation, multimodal models, narrative understanding, visual storytelling, temporal causality

Summary:
This study investigates the limitations of Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) in processing sequential visual storytelling, focusing on manga narrative understanding. The researchers introduce a novel evaluation framework involving fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented assessment to address these limitations. Through rigorous annotation and evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, they reveal that VLMs excel at individual panel interpretation but struggle with temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion for coherent story comprehension. Analysis of cross-modal similarity highlights misalignments in current VLMs' joint representations. Applying the framework to Re:Zero manga, the study explores generative storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Findings indicate that current models lack story-level intelligence, particularly in non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes a foundation for evaluating narrative intelligence and offers insights for advancing deep sequential understanding in Multimodal Models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii) comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence, struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence, while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in Multimodal Models.

<div> Keywords: pediatric chest X-ray imaging, low-dose protocols, denoising, structure-aware dual-decoder U-Net, pneumonia classification

Summary:
SharpXR is a novel denoising model specifically designed for pediatric chest X-ray imaging in low-resource settings. It addresses the challenge of noise reduction while preserving important anatomical details by utilizing a structure-aware dual-decoder U-Net architecture. By combining a Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module, SharpXR effectively suppresses noise without compromising structural information. The model, trained on simulated realistic noise data, outperforms existing methods in terms of denoising quality and computational efficiency. Notably, SharpXR improves pneumonia classification accuracy, demonstrating its potential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in pediatric care settings with limited resources. The study highlights the importance of advanced imaging techniques in improving early diagnosis and treatment outcomes for children. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details. Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource pediatric care.

Summary:
VISOR introduces a novel method for behavioral control in Vision Language Models (VLMs) using optimized visual inputs. This method allows for sophisticated control through universal steering images, enabling practical deployment across all VLM serving modalities without the need for invasive runtime access. VISOR achieves up to 25% shifts in behavioral patterns compared to traditional steering vectors. It outperforms system prompting for bidirectional control and maintains high performance on unrelated tasks. Furthermore, VISOR exposes a security vulnerability where adversaries can manipulate model behavior using only visual inputs. This work highlights the importance of defenses against visual steering attacks in protecting VLMs from malicious manipulation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront. While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective, activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments. We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25% shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However, transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

<br />Summary: <br />
Probability calibration is crucial for ensuring the reliability of predictions, especially in sensitive applications involving Vision Transformers. The traditional method of post-hoc temperature scaling, which utilizes a single global scalar and requires a validation set, is improved upon with the introduction of Calibration Attention (CalAttn). This new module enables the learning of adaptive, instance-specific temperatures directly from the ViT's CLS token. Evaluations on various datasets such as CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate that CalAttn significantly reduces calibration error by up to 4 times on models like ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin with minimal increase in parameters. The learned temperatures from CalAttn closely hover around 1.0, contrasting the commonly large global values used in standard temperature scaling techniques. CalAttn is easy to implement, efficient, compatible with different architectures, and enhances the credibility of probability estimates without compromising accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling, uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under 0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy.

Summary:<br />
- Challenges in medical image segmentation include limited annotation and domain shift. Conventional methods tailored to specific tasks lead to suboptimal performance due to error accumulation.

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation. Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models, which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data, The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations, we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2) synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in modeling the real-world degradations.

<div> Keywords: left ventricular, echocardiography, segmentation, landmark localization, clinical guidelines

Summary: 
AutoSAME is a novel framework introduced to automate left ventricular indicator measurements in echocardiography by combining segmentation and landmark localization tasks. The framework utilizes the segment anything model (SAM) to achieve visual understanding and mimic the operation of cardiac sonographers. The addition of filtered cross-branch attention (FCBA) enhances heatmap regression for key point localization. Spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) improves dense predictions by leveraging spatial properties of the left ventricle. Experimental results on echocardiography datasets demonstrate the efficacy of AutoSAME in accurately segmenting the left ventricle, localizing landmarks, and measuring indicators according to clinical guidelines. The code for AutoSAME will be available on GitHub for further exploration and utilization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However, VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously. Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers, achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective, optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and indicator measurements. The code will be available at https://github.com/QC-LIU-1997/AutoSAME.

Summary: 
The proposed method aims to enhance group robustness to spurious correlations by leveraging superclass information in class labels. By using gradient-based attention guided by a pre-trained vision-language model, the model can disentangle superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. This approach reduces reliance on spurious features and promotes the use of superclass-relevant features for prediction. The method does not require annotation of any source samples, making it more practical for real-world settings. Experimental results across various datasets show that the method outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with improvements seen in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel framework for generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions. The framework separates motion from appearance, subject from background, and action from trajectory, allowing for flexible composition of these elements. By creating a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system, motion editing is performed directly in 3D space. Trajectory control involves unprojecting 2D trajectories into 3D, aligning speed, and adjusting orientation. Actions can be sourced from a motion bank or generated through text-to-motion methods. The subject is treated as tokens for full attention in the video generation process, along with the background video and motion control signals. This approach enables the generation of realistic videos depicting various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the method's superior performance in both element-wise controllability and overall video quality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper, we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention, concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion (trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, document understanding, rule-based Reinforcement Learning, explainable reasoning, generalization

Summary:
DocThinker introduces a rule-based Reinforcement Learning framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Instead of static Chain-of-Thought templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies through policy learning. It generates explainable intermediate results such as structured reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest supporting the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based rewards and KL-constrained optimization, DocThinker mitigates catastrophic forgetting, enhances adaptability, and improves transparency. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that DocThinker significantly enhances generalization and provides more explainable and human-understandable reasoning steps. This research demonstrates the potential of Reinforcement Learning as a valuable tool for increasing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based document understanding. Code for DocThinker will be accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/wenwenyu/DocThinker.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial, and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks. In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly improves generalization while producing more explainable and human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based document understanding.

Summary:
The article introduces QueryCraft, a novel HOI detection framework that addresses the limitation of suboptimal performance in DETR-based methods by including semantic priors and guided feature learning through transformer-based query initialization. The framework incorporates ACTOR, a cross-modal Transformer encoder that leverages language-guided attention to extract action-relevant features and infer interaction semantics. Additionally, PDQD is introduced to enhance object-level query quality by distilling object category awareness from a pre-trained detector for object query initiation. The dual-branch query initialization results in more interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization of the proposed method.Code for the framework will be released upon publication.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is \textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal \textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released upon publication.

Summary: 
Yan is a comprehensive framework for interactive video generation that encompasses simulation, generation, and editing. The framework consists of three main modules: AAA-level Simulation, Multi-Modal Generation, and Multi-Granularity Editing. The AAA-level Simulation module utilizes a 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process for real-time interactive simulation. The Multi-Modal Generation module incorporates game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models to create a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time interactive video generator. The model demonstrates strong generalization when prompts are sourced from different domains, allowing for flexible blending of styles and mechanics. The Multi-Granularity Editing module disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing through text interaction. Yan integrates these modules to push interactive video generation towards an AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, promising advancements in creative tools, media, and entertainment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation, covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing. Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First, to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring (SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames. Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing self-supervised ones.

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer (IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames. However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

<br /><br />Summary: Knowledge distillation is enhanced by the Aligned Manifold Entropy (AME) method, which minimizes entropy over a shared manifold to improve robust generalization in vision-language distillation. The integration of knowledge distillation with entropy minimization on the shared manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound, ultimately improving the performance of the distillation process. AME does not require architectural modifications and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module in various distillation frameworks, consistently yielding superior generalization performance across a range of downstream tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations, which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions, conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations. This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

<div> framework, unsupervised domain adaptation, medical image segmentation, probabilistic manifold, anatomical knowledge <br />
<br />
The article introduces a novel framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in medical image segmentation that bridges the gap between source-accessible and source-free settings. Unlike previous approaches, this framework does not rely on handcrafted adaptation strategies, instead leveraging a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold to capture global anatomical regularities. This structured approach allows for semantically meaningful predictions and inherent adaptability. Experimental results on cardiac and abdominal datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both settings, with the source-free adaptation closely matching the performance of the source-accessible approach. The model's interpretability is showcased through manifold traversal, enabling smooth shape manipulation and providing insights into the underlying anatomical structures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting, where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth shape manipulation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL) approach for deep image watermarking to improve invisibility, robustness, and applicability. The two-stage optimization involves distribution alignment learning to create a common latent space for watermark embedding and recovery. This ensures imperceptible watermarking and reliable extraction under various conditions. The second stage focuses on watermark representation learning to disentangle watermarks from image content in RGB space. By penalizing fluctuations in separated watermarks, HiWL effectively learns generalizable watermark representations while maintaining low latency. Experimental results show superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving higher accuracy in watermark extraction with significantly faster processing speed. HiWL addresses the limitations of current methods and offers a promising solution for efficient and effective image watermarking. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks), 2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3) broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images processed in 8s).

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method, MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network (IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities. To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning, addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method. Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves promising performance.

<div> Ultrasound, deformable registration, physics-aware framework, contact force, anatomical alignment<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces a new physics-aware deformable registration framework, PADReg, for ultrasound images. Ultrasound deformable registration is challenging due to low contrast and noise, hindering accurate feature extraction. PADReg utilizes contact force data as a physical prior to improve registration accuracy. Instead of directly predicting deformation fields, a stiffness map is constructed from contact force and ultrasound images and used in tandem with force data to estimate a dense deformation field. Inspired by Hooke's law, PADReg ensures physically plausible registration with improved anatomical alignment compared to existing methods. Experiments on in-vivo datasets show a significant improvement in registration accuracy, with a HD95 of 12.90, 21.34% better than current state-of-the-art methods. The source code for PADReg is publicly available for further research. <div>

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching. Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images. The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel RGB-only approach, ROD, for off-road freespace detection, eliminating the need for LiDAR data and reducing computational demands. The method utilizes a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract features from RGB images and a lightweight decoder to improve precision and speed. ROD achieves state-of-the-art performance on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets and operates at an impressive inference speed of 50 FPS. The approach outperforms previous models by providing improved accuracy and faster processing times, making it suitable for real-world scenarios requiring high FPS for navigation. <div>
arXiv:2508.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS, significantly outperforming prior models.

Summary: 
Bandwidth artifacts are persisting issues in video compression despite technological advancements, particularly affecting high-definition video quality. To address this, a novel video dataset named LIVE-YT-Banding with 160 videos compressed using AV1 codec was created, along with 7200 subjective opinions from 45 individuals. The dataset allowed for studying temporal banding dynamics, crucial for advanced video codecs. A new no-reference video quality evaluator, CBAND, was introduced, leveraging deep neural network embeddings on natural image statistics to predict perceptual banding with high accuracy and efficiency. CBAND outperformed existing models significantly and can be used as a loss function for video debanding model optimization. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are publicly available for further research and development. <div>
arXiv:2508.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality. Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR) video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a model repair module to address systematic errors in deep learning models for visual recognition. Existing debugging frameworks often struggle to effectively repair these errors, leading to manual design of synthetic training images. The proposed approach leverages a conditional text-to-image model and a large vision-language model to generate targeted and semantically faithful images for failure cases. By retraining vision models with this augmented synthetic dataset, errors associated with rare cases are significantly reduced. The experiments show that this targeted repair strategy improves model robustness without introducing new bugs.

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes, repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases. To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at https://github.com/oxu2/SafeFix

<div> Keywords: lens structure segmentation, intraocular lenses, deep learning, adaptive confidence-wise loss, boundary calibration

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach, Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss, for precise segmentation of lens structures in cataract surgery. Unlike existing methods, ACW considers the varying confidence levels of expert annotations for different sub-regions of lens structures. By grouping regions into low and high confidence clusters and applying region-weighted loss, ACW outperforms other segmentation methods. An adaptive threshold optimization algorithm dynamically adjusts the confidence threshold for improved accuracy. A new metric, Boundary Expected Calibration Error (BECE), quantifies miscalibration errors in boundary region segmentation. Extensive experiments on clinical datasets show significant improvements in performance, with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction compared to traditional methods, particularly under the U-Net network. Overall, ACW shows promise in enhancing the accuracy and precision of lens structure segmentation in cataract surgery. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss, overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous (e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically, experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions, ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation, we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available at https://github.com/XiaoLing12138/Adaptive-Confidence-Wise-Loss.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of detecting deepfakes in AI-generated videos that are shared on social networks. Existing detectors struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios due to aggressive compression applied by platforms like YouTube and Facebook. The proposed framework aims to emulate the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. This approach enables the creation of a local emulator that can reproduce platform-specific artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments show that the emulated data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads, and detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos perform comparably to those trained on actual shared media. This innovative solution offers a scalable and practical way to improve the deployment of deepfake detectors in the realm of compressed video content. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However, replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore, detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of compressed video content.

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically, ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms, and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

DiffPose-Animal introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for animal pose estimation, addressing the challenges posed by interspecies morphological diversity and limited data annotations. It reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process using diffusion models, utilizing large language models to extract global anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics. These textual priors are fused with image features to provide biologically meaningful constraints during keypoint generation. A diffusion-based keypoint decoder refines pose predictions progressively, enhancing robustness to occlusion and sparse annotations. Experimental results on public animal pose datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and generalization capability, particularly in challenging scenarios with diverse species and cluttered backgrounds. The approach shows promise for applications in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and livestock management. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Summary: 
The paper introduces RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening model that aims to enhance video quality while saving on bitrate. Traditional sharpening techniques often apply uniform sharpening intensity across the video, leading to degradation in quality as texture variations are ignored. Additionally, the increase in bitrate from sharpening is not optimally allocated across different regions. RPO-AdaSharp utilizes the coding tree unit (CTU) partition mask to inform the allocation of additional bits, resulting in improved perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model both qualitatively and quantitatively.Overall, RPO-AdaSharp provides a promising solution for enhancing video quality in a region-adaptive manner while efficiently managing bitrate allocation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality. Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Summary:<br />
MonoPartNeRF introduces a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering. It utilizes a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid transformations to establish a continuous mapping between observation and canonical spaces, improving accuracy in capturing complex pose variations. The framework incorporates a part-based pose embedding mechanism that decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings guided by body regions, enhancing joint alignment. Furthermore, keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation are utilized for pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable appearance code integrated through attention enables effective modeling of dynamic texture changes, resulting in superior texture fidelity. Experimental results on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate MonoPartNeRF's ability to outperform existing methods in handling complex pose variations and occlusion, achieving excellent joint alignment, texture fidelity, and structural continuity. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion. A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and structural continuity.

However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models (VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs, and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems, we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2 latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems, or systems for detection of synthetic images.

<div> Keywords: Semantic segmentation, efficient architectures, offset learning paradigm, image features, pixel-level scene understanding

Summary:
Semantic segmentation is crucial for vision systems, but deploying it on resource-constrained devices requires efficient architectures. Existing methods achieve real-time inference through lightweight designs, but struggle with misalignment between class representations and image features. This challenge stems from a per-pixel classification paradigm, which assumes image pixel features do not vary for the same category in different images. To overcome this limitation, a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm is proposed, which dynamically refines class representations and spatial image features. The proposed OffSeg network leverages this paradigm and shows consistent improvements across various datasets with minimal additional parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset, the offset learning paradigm enhances SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, requiring only 0.1-0.2M additional parameters.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset, our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M additional parameters required.

Summary:
Token-Aware LoRA (TARA) addresses issues in multi-concept generation by introducing token masks to prevent interference between different LoRA modules and ensuring spatial alignment between attention maps and concept regions. TARA allows for efficient multi-concept composition at inference time without the need for additional training. By avoiding mutual interference between modules, TARA successfully preserves the visual identity of each concept. The proposed method improves upon existing approaches by enabling training-free multi-concept inference while maintaining the integrity of individual concepts. This advancement in personalized text-to-image generation paves the way for more effective and accurate image synthesis using only a few reference images. TARA's effectiveness in multi-concept generation showcases its potential for enhancing diversity and creativity in image synthesis tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1) token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA (TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However, their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop. Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered, part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a 55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

<br />
Summary: This study introduces a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) based on directional image curvature analysis. Anisotropic Texture Richness (ATR) is defined as a measure computed at the pixel level using tunable thresholds to quantify texture suppression. Optimized ATR scores show high correlation with human perception for Gaussian blur and white noise. A two-stage system leverages ATR responses to classify primary artifact types with high accuracy and then uses a regression model to map ATR scores to quality ratings. The system predicts human scores with a high coefficient of determination and low Root Mean Square Error, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This framework serves as a robust tool for classifying and quantifying image degradation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature. Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness (ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression. When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and -0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over 97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new competitive results. The code and models will be released at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture, segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity. Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0 guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to 7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-, voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core, contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively. Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification, and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions, leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space. Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency, reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup. Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a volunteer scan.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging, scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence. Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11 minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to 32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression, offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image, resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts, high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency, reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details. Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1 million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300 hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated. The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at https://github.com/Elman295/TCSSM.

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free, plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks. Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the same speedups.

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

<title>KFFocus: Highlighting Keyframes for Enhanced Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame, thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

<title>Spatial-Temporal Multi-Scale Quantization for Flexible Motion Generation</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

<title>UniConvNet: Expanding Effective Receptive Field while Maintaining Asymptotically Gaussian Distribution for ConvNets of Any Scale</title>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field (ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$, $11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017, and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$ FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/ai-paperwithcode/UniConvNet.

<title>Towards Perfection: Building Inter-component Mutual Correction for Retinex-based Low-light Image Enhancement</title>

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals (ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<title>Uncertainty-aware Cross-training for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model. Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

<title>When Deepfakes Look Real: Detecting AI-Generated Faces with Unlabeled Data due to Annotation Challenges</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09022</link>

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data. However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even \textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks. Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct, AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the increasing realism of deepfakes.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging.

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design. Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention, capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage PDM features - previously designed to capture identity - and show how they can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods, and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments, ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task. However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years. However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend, enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations. This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on secure access.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3) We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs, Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and rendering techniques.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs) in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43 rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class, and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3, and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km (median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70% (Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12 km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields; however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue, assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework, MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust, domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains. Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse, noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network, approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice data is sparse and noisy.

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines. Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous works.

<title>Improving Facial Rig Semantics for Tracking and Retargeting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08429</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR) environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting, we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially non-differentiable) black box.

<title>Preprocessing Algorithm Leveraging Geometric Modeling for Scale Correction in Hyperspectral Images for Improved Unmixing Performance</title>

Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral variability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by factors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate model fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and compensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm provides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively on modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's impact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms, including those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with error reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by existing methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines. The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution for complex segmentation tasks.

<title>Hybrid Long and Short Range Flows for Point Cloud Filtering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08542</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn, score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface. Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule, each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores, guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results while enabling faster inference speed.

<title>Multi-level Collaborative Distillation Meets Global Workspace Model: A Unified Framework for OCIL</title>

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective. While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared, implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch, capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models across various memory budgets.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning, which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H, STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3% higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will be available.

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more controlled and refined colorization process.

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants. Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence, human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can effectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the sharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily improve with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as over-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video quality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs effectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening level Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening level correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth. Then taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages intricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal sharpening level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of detail.

Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques. Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However, most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches. We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening. Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient (x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or SSIM.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA (GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open foundations for further CUA research.

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions. Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency. Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1 Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally, our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

Abstract: Diplomatics, the analysis of medieval charters, is a major field of research in which paleography is applied. Annotating data, if performed by laymen, needs validation and correction by experts. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient annotation approach for charter segmentation, essentially reducing it to object detection. This approach allows for a much more efficient use of the paleographer's time and produces results that can compete and even outperform pixel-level segmentation in some use cases. Further experiments shed light on how to design a class ontology in order to make the best use of annotators' time and effort. Exploiting the presence of calibration cards in the image, we further annotate the data with the physical length in pixels and train regression neural networks to predict it from image patches.

Abstract: Recently, Transformer-based text detection techniques have sought to predict polygons by encoding the coordinates of individual boundary vertices using distinct query features. However, this approach incurs a significant memory overhead and struggles to effectively capture the intricate relationships between vertices belonging to the same instance. Consequently, irregular text layouts often lead to the prediction of outlined vertices, diminishing the quality of results. To address these challenges, we present an innovative approach rooted in Sparse R-CNN: a cascade decoding pipeline for polygon prediction. Our method ensures precision by iteratively refining polygon predictions, considering both the scale and location of preceding results. Leveraging this stabilized regression pipeline, even employing just a single feature vector to guide polygon instance regression yields promising detection results. Simultaneously, the leverage of instance-level feature proposal substantially enhances memory efficiency (>50% less vs. the state-of-the-art method DPText-DETR) and reduces inference speed (>40% less vs. DPText-DETR) with minor performance drop on benchmarks.

Abstract: Most existing learning-based multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) methods suffer from significant structure inconsistency due to their inappropriate usage of structural features at the semantic level. To alleviate these issues, we propose a semantic structure-preserving fusion approach for MMIF, namely SSPFusion. At first, we design a structural feature extractor (SFE) to extract the prominent structural features from multiple input images. Concurrently, we introduce a transformation function with Sobel operator to generate self-supervised structural signals in these extracted features. Subsequently, we design a multi-scale structure-preserving fusion (SPF) module, guided by the generated structural signals, to merge the structural features of input images. This process ensures the preservation of semantic structure consistency between the resultant fusion image and the input images. Through the synergy of these two robust modules of SFE and SPF, our method can generate high-quality fusion images and demonstrate good generalization ability. Experimental results, on both infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion tasks, demonstrate that our method outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/QiaoYang-CV/SSPFUSION.

Abstract: Event cameras are a novel type of biologically inspired vision sensor known for their high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. Because of these properties, they are well-suited for processing fast motions that require rapid reactions. Although event cameras have recently shown competitive performance in unsupervised optical flow estimation, performance in detecting independently moving objects (IMOs) is lacking behind, although event-based methods would be suited for this task based on their low latency and HDR properties. Previous approaches to event-based IMO segmentation have been heavily dependent on labeled data. However, biological vision systems have developed the ability to avoid moving objects through daily tasks without being given explicit labels. In this work, we propose the first event framework that generates IMO pseudo-labels using geometric constraints. Due to its unsupervised nature, our method can handle an arbitrary number of not predetermined objects and is easily scalable to datasets where expensive IMO labels are not readily available. We evaluate our approach on the EVIMO dataset and show that it performs competitively with supervised methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: This article adopts and evaluates an AI-enabled Smart Video Solution (SVS) designed to enhance safety in the real world. The system integrates with existing infrastructure camera networks, leveraging recent advancements in AI for easy adoption. Prioritizing privacy and ethical standards, pose based data is used for downstream AI tasks such as anomaly detection. Cloud-based infrastructure and mobile app are deployed, enabling real-time alerts within communities. The SVS employs innovative data representation and visualization techniques, such as the Occupancy Indicator, Statistical Anomaly Detection, Bird's Eye View, and Heatmaps, to understand pedestrian behaviors and enhance public safety. Evaluation of the SVS demonstrates its capacity to convert complex computer vision outputs into actionable insights for stakeholders, community partners, law enforcement, urban planners, and social scientists. This article presents a comprehensive real-world deployment and evaluation of the SVS, implemented in a community college environment across 16 cameras. The system integrates AI-driven visual processing, supported by statistical analysis, database management, cloud communication, and user notifications. Additionally, the article evaluates the end-to-end latency from the moment an AI algorithm detects anomalous behavior in real-time at the camera level to the time stakeholders receive a notification. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, effectively managing 16 CCTV cameras with a consistent throughput of 16.5 frames per second (FPS) over a 21-hour period and an average end-to-end latency of 26.76 seconds between anomaly detection and alert issuance.

<title>PointDreamer: Zero-shot 3D Textured Mesh Reconstruction from Colored Point Cloud</title>

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured meshes is crucial for many applications. Compared to text or image modalities, leveraging 3D colored point clouds as input (colored-PC-to-mesh) offers inherent advantages in comprehensively and precisely replicating the target object's 360{\deg} characteristics. While most existing colored-PC-to-mesh methods suffer from blurry textures or require hard-to-acquire 3D training data, we propose PointDreamer, a novel framework that harnesses 2D diffusion prior for superior texture quality. Crucially, unlike prior 2D-diffusion-for-3D works driven by text or image inputs, PointDreamer successfully adapts 2D diffusion models to 3D point cloud data by a novel project-inpaint-unproject pipeline. Specifically, it first projects the point cloud into sparse 2D images and then performs diffusion-based inpainting. After that, diverging from most existing 3D reconstruction or generation approaches that predict texture in 3D/UV space thus often yielding blurry texture, PointDreamer achieves high-quality texture by directly unprojecting the inpainted 2D images to the 3D mesh. Furthermore, we identify for the first time a typical kind of unprojection artifact appearing in occlusion borders, which is common in other multiview-image-to-3D pipelines but less-explored. To address this, we propose a novel solution named the Non-Border-First (NBF) unprojection strategy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various synthetic and real-scanned datasets demonstrate that PointDreamer, though zero-shot, exhibits SoTA performance (30% improvement on LPIPS score from 0.118 to 0.068), and is robust to noisy, sparse, or even incomplete input data.

Abstract: Story visualization aims to create visually compelling images or videos corresponding to textual narratives. Despite recent advances in diffusion models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story. To this end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion model. DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating consistent multi-subject across the images. First, DreamStory employs the LLM to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story, annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation. Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance). Finally, the MSD uses these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent multi-subject. Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention (MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules. MMSA and MMCA modules ensure appearance and semantic consistency with reference images and text, respectively. Both modules employ masking mechanisms to prevent subject blending. To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization, we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the consistency of the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations. Please visit our project homepage at https://dream-xyz.github.io/dreamstory.

Abstract: Open-Vocab 3D Instance Segmentation methods (OV-3DIS) have recently demonstrated their ability to generalize to unseen objects. However, these methods still depend on predefined class names during testing, restricting the autonomy of agents. To mitigate this constraint, we propose a novel problem termed Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation (OE-3DIS), which eliminates the necessity for predefined class names during testing. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive set of strong baselines, derived from OV-3DIS approaches and leveraging 2D Multimodal Large Language Models. To assess the performance of our OE-3DIS system, we introduce a novel Open-Ended score, evaluating both the semantic and geometric quality of predicted masks and their associated class names, alongside the standard AP score. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baselines on the ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ datasets. Remarkably, our method surpasses the performance of Open3DIS, the current state-of-the-art method in OV-3DIS, even in the absence of ground-truth object class names.

Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has achieved significant progress in both research and applications. While recent baselines struggle to generate natural and continuous facial movements due to their frame-by-frame vertex generation approach, we propose 3DFacePolicy, a pioneer work that introduces a novel definition of vertex trajectory changes across consecutive frames through the concept of "action". By predicting action sequences for each vertex that encode frame-to-frame movements, we reformulate vertex generation approach into an action-based control paradigm. Specifically, we leverage a robotic control mechanism, diffusion policy, to predict action sequences conditioned on both audio and vertex states. Extensive experiments on VOCASET and BIWI datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is particularly expert in dynamic, expressive and naturally smooth facial animations.

Abstract: Facial expression datasets remain limited in scale due to the subjectivity of annotations and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. This limitation poses a significant challenge for developing modern deep learning-based facial expression analysis models, particularly foundation models, that rely on large-scale data for optimal performance. To tackle the overarching and complex challenge, instead of introducing a new large-scale dataset, we introduce SynFER (Synthesis of Facial Expressions with Refined Control), a novel synthetic framework for synthesizing facial expression image data based on high-level textual descriptions as well as more fine-grained and precise control through facial action units. To ensure the quality and reliability of the synthetic data, we propose a semantic guidance technique to steer the generation process and a pseudo-label generator to help rectify the facial expression labels for the synthetic images. To demonstrate the generation fidelity and the effectiveness of the synthetic data from SynFER, we conduct extensive experiments on representation learning using both synthetic data and real-world data. Results validate the efficacy of our approach and the synthetic data. Notably, our approach achieves a 67.23% classification accuracy on AffectNet when training solely with synthetic data equivalent to the AffectNet training set size, which increases to 69.84% when scaling up to five times the original size.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) seeks to recover high-quality images from degraded observations caused by a wide range of factors, including noise, blur, compression, and adverse weather. While traditional IR methods have made notable progress by targeting individual degradation types, their specialization often comes at the cost of generalization, leaving them ill-equipped to handle the multifaceted distortions encountered in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance the convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we provide the first in-depth and systematic overview of AiOIR, delivering a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing methods by architectural designs, learning paradigms, and their core innovations. We systematically categorize current approaches and assess the challenges these models encounter, outlining research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. To facilitate the evaluation of existing methods, we also consolidate widely-used datasets, evaluation protocols, and implementation practices, and compare and summarize the most advanced open-source models. As the first comprehensive review dedicated to AiOIR, this paper aims to map the conceptual landscape, synthesize prevailing techniques, and ignite further exploration toward more intelligent, unified, and adaptable visual restoration systems.

Abstract: Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this paper, we argue that videos contain significantly more redundant information than images, allowing them to be encoded with very few motion latents. Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE that projects videos into extremely compressed latent space and decode them based on content images. This magic Reducio charm enables 64x reduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality. Building upon Reducio-VAE, we can train diffusion models for high-resolution video generation efficiently. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage generation paradigm, first generating a condition image via text-to-image generation, followed by text-image-to-video generation with the proposed Reducio-DiT. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves strong performance in evaluation. More importantly, our method significantly boosts the training and inference efficiency of video LDMs. Reducio-DiT is trained in just 3.2K A100 GPU hours in total and can generate a 16-frame 1024$\times$1024 video clip within 15.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

Abstract: Generating 3D meshes from a single image is an important but ill-posed task. Existing methods mainly adopt 2D multiview diffusion models to generate intermediate multiview images, and use the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) to create the final meshes. However, the multiview images exhibit local inconsistencies, and the meshes often lack fidelity to the input image or look blurry. We propose Fancy123, featuring two enhancement modules and an unprojection operation to address the above three issues, respectively. The appearance enhancement module deforms the 2D multiview images to realign misaligned pixels for better multiview consistency. The fidelity enhancement module deforms the 3D mesh to match the input image. The unprojection of the input image and deformed multiview images onto LRM's generated mesh ensures high clarity, discarding LRM's predicted blurry-looking mesh colors. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify Fancy123's SoTA performance with significant improvement. Also, the two enhancement modules are plug-and-play and work at inference time, allowing seamless integration into various existing single-image-to-3D methods.

Abstract: Detecting prohibited items in X-ray security imagery is a challenging yet crucial task. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, object detection algorithms have been widely applied in this area. However, the distribution of object classes in real-world prohibited item detection scenarios often exhibits a distinct long-tailed distribution. Due to the unique principles of X-ray imaging, conventional methods for long-tailed object detection are often ineffective in this domain. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Prior-Aware Debiasing Framework (PAD-F), a novel approach that employs a two-pronged strategy leveraging both material and co-occurrence priors. At the data level, our Explicit Material-Aware Augmentation (EMAA) component generates numerous challenging training samples for tail classes. It achieves this through a placement strategy guided by material-specific absorption rates and a gradient-based Poisson blending technique. At the feature level, the Implicit Co-occurrence Aggregator (ICA) acts as a plug-in module that enhances features for ambiguous objects by implicitly learning and aggregating statistical co-occurrence relationships within the image. Extensive experiments on the HiXray and PIDray datasets demonstrate that PAD-F significantly boosts the performance of multiple popular detectors. It achieves an absolute improvement of up to +17.2% in AP50 for tail classes and comprehensively outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides an effective and versatile solution to the critical problem of long-tailed detection in X-ray security.

Abstract: Recent 4D reconstruction methods have yielded impressive results but rely on sharp videos as supervision. However, motion blur often occurs in videos due to camera shake and object movement, while existing methods render blurry results when using such videos for reconstructing 4D models. Although a few approaches attempted to address the problem, they struggled to produce high-quality results, due to the inaccuracy in estimating continuous dynamic representations within the exposure time. Encouraged by recent works in 3D motion trajectory modeling using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we take 3DGS as the scene representation manner, and propose Deblur4DGS to reconstruct a high-quality 4D model from blurry monocular video. Specifically, we transform continuous dynamic representations estimation within an exposure time into the exposure time estimation. Moreover, we introduce the exposure regularization term, multi-frame, and multi-resolution consistency regularization term to avoid trivial solutions. Furthermore, to better represent objects with large motion, we suggest blur-aware variable canonical Gaussians. Beyond novel-view synthesis, Deblur4DGS can be applied to improve blurry video from multiple perspectives, including deblurring, frame interpolation, and video stabilization. Extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world data on the above four tasks show that Deblur4DGS outperforms state-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods.

We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of learning good representations from real-world continuous uncurated data streams. However, most existing works in visual self-supervised learning focus on static images or artificial data streams. Towards exploring a more realistic learning substrate, we investigate streaming self-supervised learning from long-form real-world egocentric video streams. Inspired by the event segmentation mechanism in human perception and memory, we propose "Memory Storyboard" that groups recent past frames into temporal segments for more effective summarization of the past visual streams for memory replay. To accommodate efficient temporal segmentation, we propose a two-tier memory hierarchy: the recent past is stored in a short-term memory, and the storyboard temporal segments are then transferred to a long-term memory. Experiments on real-world egocentric video datasets including SAYCam and KrishnaCam show that contrastive learning objectives on top of storyboard frames result in semantically meaningful representations that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning methods.

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of using large multimodal models (LMMs) to automatically annotate human emotions in everyday scenarios. We conducted experiments on the DailyLife subset of the publicly available FERV39k dataset, employing the GPT-4o-mini model for rapid, zero-shot labeling of key frames extracted from video segments. Under a seven-class emotion taxonomy ("Angry," "Disgust," "Fear," "Happy," "Neutral," "Sad," "Surprise"), the LMM achieved an average precision of approximately 50%. In contrast, when limited to ternary emotion classification (negative/neutral/positive), the average precision increased to approximately 64%. Additionally, we explored a strategy that integrates multiple frames within 1-2 second video clips to enhance labeling performance and reduce costs. The results indicate that this approach can slightly improve annotation accuracy. Overall, our preliminary findings highlight the potential application of zero-shot LMMs in human facial emotion annotation tasks, offering new avenues for reducing labeling costs and broadening the applicability of LMMs in complex multimodal environments.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are a powerful yet underexplored class of generative models compared to U-Net-based diffusion architectures. We propose TIDE-Temporal-aware sparse autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion transformErs-a framework designed to extract sparse, interpretable activation features across timesteps in DiTs. TIDE effectively captures temporally-varying representations and reveals that DiTs naturally learn hierarchical semantics (e.g., 3D structure, object class, and fine-grained concepts) during large-scale pretraining. Experiments show that TIDE enhances interpretability and controllability while maintaining reasonable generation quality, enabling applications such as safe image editing and style transfer.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes progressively while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Recent advances in this field have shifted towards parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, with many approaches building upon the framework that maintains a pool of learnable prompts. Although effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, primarily due to prompt pool querying and increased input sequence lengths from prompt concatenation. In this work, we present a novel prompt-based approach that addresses this limitation. Our method trains a single set of shared prompts across all tasks and, rather than concatenating prompts to the input, directly modifies the CLS token's attention computation by adding the prompts to it. This simple and lightweight design not only significantly reduces computational complexity-both in terms of inference costs and the number of trainable parameters-but also eliminates the need to optimize prompt lengths for different downstream tasks, offering a more efficient yet powerful solution for rehearsal-free class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to establish a new prompt-based CIL paradigm. Furthermore, experiments on general recognition benchmarks beyond the CIL setting also show strong performance, positioning our method as a promising candidate for a general parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.

Abstract: Open Semantic Mapping (OSM) is a key technology in robotic perception, combining semantic segmentation and SLAM techniques. This paper introduces a dynamically configurable and highly automated LLM/LVLM-powered pipeline for evaluating OSM solutions called OSMa-Bench (Open Semantic Mapping Benchmark). The study focuses on evaluating state-of-the-art semantic mapping algorithms under varying indoor lighting conditions, a critical challenge in indoor environments. We introduce a novel dataset with simulated RGB-D sequences and ground truth 3D reconstructions, facilitating the rigorous analysis of mapping performance across different lighting conditions. Through experiments on leading models such as ConceptGraphs, BBQ and OpenScene, we evaluate the semantic fidelity of object recognition and segmentation. Additionally, we introduce a Scene Graph evaluation method to analyze the ability of models to interpret semantic structure. The results provide insights into the robustness of these models, forming future research directions for developing resilient and adaptable robotic systems.

Abstract: Although recent methods have tried to introduce large multimodal models (LMMs) into industrial anomaly detection (IAD), their generalization in the IAD field is far inferior to that for general purposes. We summarize the main reasons for this gap into two aspects. On one hand, general-purpose LMMs lack cognition of defects in the visual modality, thereby failing to sufficiently focus on defect areas. Therefore, we propose to modify the AnyRes structure of the LLaVA model, providing the potential anomalous areas identified by existing IAD models to the LMMs. On the other hand, existing methods mainly focus on identifying defects by learning defect patterns or comparing with normal samples, yet they fall short of understanding the causes of these defects. Considering that the generation of defects is closely related to the manufacturing process, we propose a manufacturing-driven IAD paradigm. An instruction-tuning dataset for IAD (InstructIAD) and a data organization approach for Chain-of-Thought with manufacturing (CoT-M) are designed to leverage the manufacturing process for IAD. Based on the above two modifications, we present Triad, a novel LMM-based method incorporating an expert-guided region-of-interest tokenizer and manufacturing process for industrial anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show that our Triad not only demonstrates competitive performance against current LMMs but also achieves further improved accuracy when equipped with manufacturing processes. Source code, training data, and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/tzjtatata/Triad.

<title>SketchSplat: 3D Edge Reconstruction via Differentiable Multi-view Sketch Splatting</title>

Abstract: Edges are one of the most basic parametric primitives to describe structural information in 3D. In this paper, we study parametric 3D edge reconstruction from calibrated multi-view images. Previous methods usually reconstruct a 3D edge point set from multi-view 2D edge images, and then fit 3D edges to the point set. However, noise in the point set may cause gaps among fitted edges, and the recovered edges may not align with input multi-view images since the edge fitting depends only on the reconstructed 3D point set. To mitigate these problems, we propose SketchSplat, a method to reconstruct accurate, complete, and compact 3D edges via differentiable multi-view sketch splatting. We represent 3D edges as sketches, which are parametric lines and curves defined by attributes including control points, scales, and opacity. During reconstruction, we iteratively sample Gaussian points from a set of sketches and rasterize the Gaussians onto 2D edge images. Then the gradient of the image loss can be back-propagated to optimize the sketch attributes. Our method bridges 2D edge images and 3D edges in a differentiable manner, which ensures that 3D edges align well with 2D images and leads to accurate and complete results. We also propose a series of adaptive topological operations to reduce redundant edges and apply them along with the sketch optimization, yielding a more compact reconstruction. Finally, we contribute an accurate 2D edge detector that improves the performance of both ours and existing methods. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, completeness, and compactness on a benchmark CAD dataset.

Abstract: A common dilemma while photographing a scene is whether to capture it at a wider angle, allowing more of the scene to be covered but in less detail or to click in a narrow angle that captures better details but leaves out portions of the scene. We propose a novel method in this paper that infuses wider shots with finer quality details that is usually associated with an image captured by the primary lens by capturing the same scene using both narrow and wide field of view (FoV) lenses. We do so by training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model to learn to extract the visual quality parameters from a narrow-angle shot and to transfer these to the corresponding wide-angle image of the scene using residual connections and an attention-based fusion module. We have mentioned in details the proposed technique to isolate the visual essence of an image and to transfer it into another image. We have also elaborately discussed our implementation details and have presented the results of evaluation over several benchmark datasets and comparisons with contemporary advancements in the field.

Abstract: While transformers have surpassed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various computer vision tasks, microelectronics defect detection still largely relies on CNNs. We hypothesize that this gap is due to the fact that a) transformers have an increased need for data and b) (labelled) image generation procedures for microelectronics are costly, and data is therefore sparse. Whereas in other domains, pre-training on large natural image datasets can mitigate this problem, in microelectronics transfer learning is hindered due to the dissimilarity of domain data and natural images. We address this challenge through self pre-training, where models are pre-trained directly on the target dataset, rather than another dataset. We propose a resource-efficient vision transformer (ViT) pre-training framework for defect detection in microelectronics based on masked autoencoders (MAE). We perform pre-training and defect detection using a dataset of less than 10,000 scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) images. Our experimental results show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains compared to a) supervised ViT, b) ViT pre-trained on natural image datasets, and c) state-of-the-art CNN-based defect detection models used in microelectronics. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals that our self pre-trained models attend to defect-relevant features such as cracks in the solder material, while baseline models often attend to spurious patterns. This shows that our approach yields defect-specific feature representations, resulting in more interpretable and generalizable transformer models for this data-sparse domain.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore how conventional image enhancement can improve model robustness in medical image analysis. By applying commonly used normalization methods to images from various vendors and studying their influence on model generalization in transfer learning, we show that the nonlinear characteristics of domain-specific image dynamics cannot be addressed by simple linear transforms. To tackle this issue, we reformulate the image harmonization task as an exposure correction problem and propose a method termed Global Deep Curve Estimation (GDCE) to reduce domain-specific exposure mismatch. GDCE performs enhancement via a pre-defined polynomial function and is trained with a "domain discriminator", aiming to improve model transparency in downstream tasks compared to existing black-box methods.

Abstract: A solar panel harvests the most energy when pointing in the direction that maximizes the total illumination (irradiance) falling on it. Given an arbitrary panel orientation and an arbitrary environmental illumination, we address the problem of finding the direction of maximum total irradiance. We develop a minimal sensing approach where measurements from just four photodetectors are used to iteratively vary the tilt of the panel to maximize the irradiance. Many environments produce irradiance functions with multiple local maxima. As a result, simply measuring the gradient of the irradiance function and applying gradient ascent will not work. We show that a larger, optimized tilt between the detectors and the panel is equivalent to blurring the irradiance function. This has the effect of eliminating local maxima and turning the irradiance function into a unimodal one, whose maximum can be found using gradient ascent. We show that there is a close relationship between our approach and scale space theory. We collected a large dataset of high-dynamic range lighting environments in Manhattan, called UrbanSky. We use this dataset to conduct simulations to verify the robustness of our approach. Next, we simulate the energy harvested using our approach under dynamic illumination. Finally, we built a portable solar panel with four compact detectors and an actuator to conduct experiments in various real-world settings: direct sunlight, cloudy sky, urban settings with occlusions and shadows, and complex indoor lighting. In all cases, we show improvements in harvested energy compared to standard approaches for orienting a solar panel.

Abstract: This paper presents SPIE: a novel approach for semantic and structural post-training of instruction-based image editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in alignment with user prompts and consistency with input images. We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the alignment with instructions and realism in two ways. First, SPIE captures fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. Second, it achieves precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIE can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where targeted image edits enhance the visual realism of simulated environments, which improves their utility as proxy for real-world settings.

Abstract: In human-centered environments such as restaurants, homes, and warehouses, robots often face challenges in accurately recognizing 3D objects. These challenges stem from the complexity and variability of these environments, including diverse object shapes. In this paper, we propose a novel Lightweight Multi-modal Multi-view Convolutional-Vision Transformer network (LM-MCVT) to enhance 3D object recognition in robotic applications. Our approach leverages the Globally Entropy-based Embeddings Fusion (GEEF) method to integrate multi-views efficiently. The LM-MCVT architecture incorporates pre- and mid-level convolutional encoders and local and global transformers to enhance feature extraction and recognition accuracy. We evaluate our method on the synthetic ModelNet40 dataset and achieve a recognition accuracy of 95.6% using a four-view setup, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. To further validate its effectiveness, we conduct 5-fold cross-validation on the real-world OmniObject3D dataset using the same configuration. Results consistently show superior performance, demonstrating the method's robustness in 3D object recognition across synthetic and real-world 3D data.

Abstract: Visual recognition relies on understanding both the semantics of image tokens and the complex interactions among them. Mainstream self-attention methods, while effective at modeling global pair-wise relations, fail to capture high-order associations inherent in real-world scenes and often suffer from redundant computation. Hypergraphs extend conventional graphs by modeling high-order interactions and offer a promising framework for addressing these limitations. However, existing hypergraph neural networks typically rely on static and hard hyperedge assignments, leading to excessive and redundant hyperedges with hard binary vertex memberships that overlook the continuity of visual semantics. To overcome these issues, we present Soft Hypergraph Neural Networks (SoftHGNNs), which extend the methodology of hypergraph computation, to make it truly efficient and versatile in visual recognition tasks. Our framework introduces the concept of soft hyperedges, where each vertex is associated with hyperedges via continuous participation weights rather than hard binary assignments. This dynamic and differentiable association is achieved by using the learnable hyperedge prototype. Through similarity measurements between token features and the prototype, the model generates semantically rich soft hyperedges. SoftHGNN then aggregates messages over soft hyperedges to capture high-order semantics. To further enhance efficiency when scaling up the number of soft hyperedges, we incorporate a sparse hyperedge selection mechanism that activates only the top-k important hyperedges, along with a load-balancing regularizer to ensure balanced hyperedge utilization. Experimental results across three tasks on five datasets demonstrate that SoftHGNN efficiently captures high-order associations in visual scenes, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance on multimodal tasks but often suffer from hallucination, and confidently describe objects or attributes not present in the image. Current training-free interventions struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding guided by the model's confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form generations, effectively reducing hallucination.

Abstract: Story visualization aims to generate coherent image sequences that faithfully depict a narrative and align with character references. Despite progress in generative models, existing benchmarks are narrow in scope, often limited to short prompts, no character reference, or single-image cases, and fall short of real-world storytelling complexity. This hinders a nuanced understanding of model capabilities and limitations. We present ViStoryBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate story visualization models across diverse narrative structures, visual styles, and character settings. The benchmark features richly annotated multi-shot scripts derived from curated stories spanning literature, film, and folklore. Large language models assist in story summarization and script generation, with all outputs verified by humans to ensure coherence and fidelity. Character references are carefully curated to maintain intra-story consistency across varying artistic styles. To enable thorough evaluation, ViStoryBench introduces a set of automated metrics that assess character consistency, style similarity, prompt adherence, aesthetic quality, and generation artifacts such as copy-paste behavior. These metrics are validated through human studies, and used to benchmark a broad range of open-source and commercial models. ViStoryBench offers a high-fidelity, multi-dimensional evaluation suite that facilitates systematic analysis and fosters future progress in visual storytelling.

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generation have shown promising results, yet existing approaches struggle with scene-consistent memory capabilities in long video generation due to limited use of historical context. In this work, we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during training.

Abstract: Foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong generalization capabilities due to large-scale pretraining on diverse image-text pairs. However, their performance often degrades when applied to target datasets with significant distribution shifts in both visual appearance and class semantics. Recent few-shot learning approaches adapt CLIP to downstream tasks using limited labeled data via adapter or prompt tuning, but are not specifically designed to handle such extreme domain shifts. Conversely, some works addressing cross-domain few-shot learning consider such domain-shifted scenarios but operate in an episodic setting with only a few classes per episode, limiting their applicability to real-world deployment, where all classes must be handled simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, MIST (Multiple Stochastic Prompt Tuning), for efficiently adapting CLIP to datasets with extreme distribution shifts using only a few labeled examples, in scenarios involving all classes at once. Specifically, we introduce multiple learnable prompts per class to effectively capture diverse modes in visual representations arising from distribution shifts. To further enhance generalization, these prompts are modeled as learnable Gaussian distributions, enabling efficient exploration of the prompt parameter space and reducing overfitting caused by limited supervision. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine search strategy to enable flexible control over accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and ensure robust matching even between descriptors from different image types. This approach allows HypeVPR to outperform existing methods while significantly accelerating retrieval and reducing database storage requirements.

Abstract: Many studies have been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for the further processing required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a polygonal approximation was the figure of merit. Later,it was noted that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason which is why Rosin-through mathematical analysis-introduced a measure called merit. However,this measure involves an optimal scheme of polygonal approximation,so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of fit of an approximation. This led many researchers to use a weighted figure of merit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare sub optimal schemes. An attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures-weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure-are related so that one can be used instead of the other, and toward this end, theoretical analysis, experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The mathematical formulas for the weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are analyzed, and through proof of theorems,it is found that the two measures are theoretically independent of each other. The graphical analysis of experiments carried out using a public dataset supports the results of the theoretical analysis. The statistical analysis via Pearson's correlation coefficient and non-linear correlation measure also revealed that the two measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a suboptimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other suboptimal scheme,as indicated by Rosin's measure,then the same conclusion cannot be drawn using a weighted figure of merit,so one cannot use a weighted figure of merit instead of Rosin's measure.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts -- where missed cues can stereotype communities and undermine usability. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit (stated) as well as implicit (unstated, implied by the prompt's cultural context) cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we show that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, provide a concrete testbed, and outline actionable directions for developing culturally informed T2I models and metrics that improve global usability.

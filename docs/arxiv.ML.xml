Abstract: Since the Fourth Industrial Revolution, AI technology has been widely used in many fields, but there are several limitations that need to be overcome, including overfitting/underfitting, class imbalance, and the limitations of representation (hypothesis space) due to the characteristics of different models. As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as model combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning. Among ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with various weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the existing methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights consider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various information that should be considered in a model realistically. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of making decisions considering various information through cooperative games in multi-criteria situations. Using this method, various types of information known beforehand in classifiers can be simultaneously considered and reflected, leading to appropriate weight distribution and performance improvement. The machine learning algorithms were applied to the Open-ML-CC18 dataset and compared with existing ensemble weighting methods. The experimental results showed superior performance compared to other weighting methods.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable reasoning capabilities across domains like code, math and other enterprise tasks, their significant memory and computational costs often preclude their use in practical enterprise settings. To this end, we introduce Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter model in the ServiceNow Apriel SLM series that achieves performance against medium sized state-of-the-art models such as o1-mini, QWQ32B, and EXAONE-Deep-32B while maintaining only half the memory footprint of those alternatives. Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model is trained in a four stage training pipeline including 1) Base Model upscaling, 2) Continual Pre-training 3) Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and 4) Reinforcement Learning using GRPO. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite of benchmarks consistently demonstrate that our Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model matches or exceeds the performance of its 32-billion parameter counterparts, despite being less than half their size.

<div> Keywords: AI models, medical domain, continual learning, diabetic retinopathy, sustainable healthcare

Summary: 
This research paper introduces a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach for medical AI models, addressing data sharing constraints in the medical domain. With a unified prompt pool and minimal expansion strategy, the proposed method reduces computational overhead while balancing retention and adaptation. Experimental results on diabetic retinopathy datasets show that the model improves final classification accuracy and F1-score significantly compared to existing methods, while also lowering inference cost. The study aims to drive sustainable advancements in medical AI, facilitating real-time diagnosis, patient monitoring, and telemedicine applications in distributed healthcare settings. The code for the approach will be made publicly available upon acceptance. <div>

Abstract: Modern AI models achieve state-of-the-art performance with large-scale, high-quality datasets; however, ethical, social, and institutional constraints in the medical domain severely restrict data sharing, rendering centralized learning nearly impossible. Each institution must incrementally update models using only local data. Traditional training overfits new samples and suffers from catastrophic forgetting, losing previously acquired knowledge. Medical data distributions also shift due to varying diagnostic equipment and demographics. Although continual learning (CL) has advanced, most methods address natural images, leaving medical-domain-specific CL underexplored. We propose a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach featuring a unified prompt pool with a minimal expansion strategy: by expanding and freezing a subset of prompts, our method reduces computational overhead, and a novel regularization term balances retention and adaptation. Experiments on three diabetic retinopathy datasets Aptos2019, LI2019, and Diabetic Retinopathy Detection show our model improves final classification accuracy by at least 10% and F1-score by 9 points over state-of-the-art approaches while lowering inference cost. We anticipate this study will drive sustainable medical AI advances, enabling real-time diagnosis, patient monitoring, and telemedicine applications in distributed healthcare. Code will be released upon acceptance

Summary: 
Retro-Expert is a new interpretable retrosynthesis framework that combines the reasoning strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized models through reinforcement learning. It offers natural language explanations rooted in chemical logic by using specialized models for shallow reasoning, LLM-driven critical reasoning for predictions and reasoning paths, and reinforcement learning for optimizing decision policy. In experiments, Retro-Expert outperforms LLM-based and specialized models, providing expert-aligned explanations that enhance understanding and bridge the gap between AI predictions and practical chemical insights. <div>
arXiv:2508.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction aims to infer the reactant molecule based on a given product molecule, which is a fundamental task in chemical synthesis. However, existing models rely on static pattern-matching paradigm, which limits their ability to perform effective logic decision-making, leading to black-box decision-making. Building on this, we propose Retro-Expert, an interpretable retrosynthesis framework that performs collaborative reasoning by combining the complementary reasoning strengths of Large Language Models and specialized models via reinforcement learning. It outputs natural language explanations grounded in chemical logic through three components: (1) specialized models perform shallow reasoning to construct high-quality chemical decision space, (2) LLM-driven critical reasoning to generate predictions and corresponding interpretable reasoning path, and (3) reinforcement learning optimizing interpretable decision policy. Experiments show that Retro-Expert not only surpasses both LLM-based and specialized models across different metrics but also provides expert-aligned explanations that bridge the gap between AI predictions and actionable chemical insights.

<div> Keywords: large language model pretraining, synthetic data generation, data quality, model performance, training efficiency

Summary:<br>
Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) pretraining have highlighted the importance of synthetic data generation as a means to enhance performance beyond the limitations of scaling data quantity alone. The study introduces BeyondWeb, a synthetic data framework that outperforms existing datasets like Cosmopedia and Nemotron-CC's synthetic subset, Nemotron-Synth. BeyondWeb offers faster training efficiency, with a 3B model on BeyondWeb surpassing an 8B model on Cosmopedia. Insights from BeyondWeb emphasize the need for optimizing various factors in synthetic data generation, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The study showcases the benefits of well-executed synthetic data generation in enhancing pretraining outcomes, underscoring the need for a combination of scientific rigor and practical expertise in this domain.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this, the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1 percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of 14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for 180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality. Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements, potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-image models, model selection, fine-tuning, pretrained models, performance indication

Summary:
The paper introduces a model selection framework, M&C, for efficiently choosing a pretrained Text-to-image (T2I) model from a model platform for fine-tuning on a target dataset. M&C utilizes a matching graph that includes nodes representing available models and datasets, with edges capturing performance and data similarity. By considering model/data features and graph embeddings, M&C predicts the best model for fine-tuning on the target domain. Evaluation on ten T2I models and 32 datasets shows that M&C successfully predicts the best model in 61.3% of cases. This framework addresses the challenge of selecting the most suitable pretrained T2I model for specific target data domains, helping users streamline the process of building AI applications for generating media contents. The results highlight the effectiveness of M&C in guiding model selection for optimal performance in T2I tasks.  

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain? Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&amp;C, which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The core of M&amp;C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&amp;C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines. Our results show that M&amp;C successfully predicts the best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model for the rest.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Entropy, Exploration, Exploitation

Summary:
CURE (Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention) is introduced to address the issue of low diversity model behavior in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR). The framework balances exploration and exploitation through a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical tokens are regenerated at high entropy to steer the model towards novel yet coherent contexts. This process results in better performance on math reasoning tasks while sustaining high-level entropy for exploration. In the second stage, training continues with static initial-state sampling to strengthen exploitation gradually. Experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B demonstrate that CURE outperforms other RLVR methods, achieving a 5% performance gain across six math benchmarks. The framework establishes state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and accuracy. The effectiveness of CURE is further validated through a series of experiments. The code for CURE is available on GitHub at https://github.com/CURE-Project/CURE. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) have driven the emergence of more sophisticated cognitive behaviors in large language models (LLMs), thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE (Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically, in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration. In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that, compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/CURE-Project/CURE.

<div> quantization, neural networks, pruning, strong lottery ticket hypothesis, finite-precision

Summary:
Using insights from the Random Subset Sum Problem and Number Partitioning Problem, this work extends the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH) framework to finite-precision neural networks. The study demonstrates that in the quantized setting, certain target discrete neural networks can be represented exactly through pruning, with optimal bounds on necessary overparameterization. Previous theoretical work on the SLTH framework primarily focused on the continuous setting, but this research expands these findings to the quantized setting, providing valuable insights into the construction of efficient neural networks with limited precision. The results highlight the potential for achieving exact representations of target networks through pruning strategies, shedding light on the theoretical foundations of quantization in neural networks. <div>
arXiv:2508.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization is an essential technique for making neural networks more efficient, yet our theoretical understanding of it remains limited. Previous works demonstrated that extremely low-precision networks, such as binary networks, can be constructed by pruning large, randomly-initialized networks, and showed that the ratio between the size of the original and the pruned networks is at most polylogarithmic.
  The specific pruning method they employed inspired a line of theoretical work known as the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH), which leverages insights from the Random Subset Sum Problem. However, these results primarily address the continuous setting and cannot be applied to extend SLTH results to the quantized setting.
  In this work, we build on foundational results by Borgs et al. on the Number Partitioning Problem to derive new theoretical results for the Random Subset Sum Problem in a quantized setting.
  Using these results, we then extend the SLTH framework to finite-precision networks. While prior work on SLTH showed that pruning allows approximation of a certain class of neural networks, we demonstrate that, in the quantized setting, the analogous class of target discrete neural networks can be represented exactly, and we prove optimal bounds on the necessary overparameterization of the initial network as a function of the precision of the target network.

Summary:<br>
- Conformal prediction is an uncertainty quantification method that enhances base predictors with statistically valid prediction sets.
- Current methods are computationally expensive and data-intensive, requiring an uncertainty model before calibration.
- Zono-conformal prediction introduces zonotopes as prediction sets to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs.
- It constructs zono-conformal predictors via a single, data-efficient linear program, particularly focusing on feed-forward neural networks.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that augments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while achieving a similar coverage over the test data.

<div> trust, belief, confidence, learning rates, probability

Summary:
The article explores the concept of confidence in learning and belief updating processes. It distinguishes confidence from probability or likelihood, highlighting its significance in understanding the impact of incoming information on the belief state. The notion of learner's confidence is formalized through axioms and can be measured on a continuum. Confidence encompasses familiar concepts such as learning rates, training epochs, Shafer's weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. It is shown that confidence can always be represented in certain ways and, under specific assumptions, more concise representations of confidence-based learning can be derived using vector fields and loss functions. These representations lead to an extended language involving compound "parallel" observations. The article also links Bayes Rule to an optimizing learner with a linear expectation loss representation. <div>
arXiv:2508.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize a notion of confidence that arises in learning or updating beliefs: the amount of trust one has in incoming information and its impact on the belief state. This learner's confidence can be used alongside (and is easily mistaken for) probability or likelihood, but it is fundamentally a different concept -- one that captures many familiar concepts in the literature, including learning rates and number of training epochs, Shafer's weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. We formally axiomatize what it means to learn with confidence, give two canonical ways of measuring confidence on a continuum, and prove that confidence can always be represented in this way. Under additional assumptions, we derive more compact representations of confidence-based learning in terms of vector fields and loss functions. These representations induce an extended language of compound "parallel" observations. We characterize Bayes Rule as the special case of an optimizing learner whose loss representation is a linear expectation.

Summary: <br>
- The paper discusses how for general non-Gaussian distributions, the covariance and precision matrices do not convey the independence structure of variables like they do for the multivariate Gaussian distribution.
- It focuses on a class of non-Gaussian distributions derived from diagonal transformations of a Gaussian, known as the generalized nonparanormal, where conditional independence information can be inferred from the precision matrix under specific criteria.
- The transformations defining these distributions can be arbitrary in nature.

Abstract: For general non-Gaussian distributions, the covariance and precision matrices do not encode the independence structure of the variables, as they do for the multivariate Gaussian. This paper builds on previous work to show that for a class of non-Gaussian distributions -- those derived from diagonal transformations of a Gaussian -- information about the conditional independence structure can still be inferred from the precision matrix, provided the data meet certain criteria, analogous to the Gaussian case. We call such transformations of the Gaussian as the generalized nonparanormal. The functions that define these transformations are, in a broad sense, arbitrary. We also provide a simple and computationally efficient algorithm that leverages this theory to recover conditional independence structure from the generalized nonparanormal data. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via synthetic experiments and applications to real-world data.

Abstract: Post hoc explanation methods, such as LIME and SHAP, provide interpretable insights into black-box classifiers and are increasingly used to assess model biases and generalizability. However, these methods are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, potentially concealing harmful biases. Building on the work of Slack et al. (2020), we investigate the susceptibility of LIME and SHAP to biased models and evaluate strategies for improving robustness. We first replicate the original COMPAS experiment to validate prior findings and establish a baseline. We then introduce a modular testing framework enabling systematic evaluation of augmented and ensemble explanation approaches across classifiers of varying performance. Using this framework, we assess multiple LIME/SHAP ensemble configurations on out-of-distribution models, comparing their resistance to bias concealment against the original methods. Our results identify configurations that substantially improve bias detection, highlighting their potential for enhancing transparency in the deployment of high-stakes machine learning systems.

Summary: <br>
The study focuses on creating sample-level embeddings for microbiome data that consider taxa abundance. Using an abundance-aware variant of the Set Transformer model, the researchers weighted sequence embeddings based on their relative abundance to construct fixed-size sample embeddings. This method, which replicates embedding vectors according to abundance and applies self-attention-based aggregation, outperformed traditional averaging and unweighted Set Transformers in microbiome classification tasks. The results showed perfect performance in some instances, highlighting the importance of incorporating abundance information for accurate and biologically meaningful microbiome representation.

Abstract: Microbiome sample representation to input into LLMs is essential for downstream tasks such as phenotype prediction and environmental classification. While prior studies have explored embedding-based representations of each microbiome sample, most rely on simple averaging over sequence embeddings, often overlooking the biological importance of taxa abundance. In this work, we propose an abundance-aware variant of the Set Transformer to construct fixed-size sample-level embeddings by weighting sequence embeddings according to their relative abundance. Without modifying the model architecture, we replicate embedding vectors proportional to their abundance and apply self-attention-based aggregation. Our method outperforms average pooling and unweighted Set Transformers on real-world microbiome classification tasks, achieving perfect performance in some cases. These results demonstrate the utility of abundance-aware aggregation for robust and biologically informed microbiome representation. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first approaches to integrate sequence-level abundance into Transformer-based sample embeddings.

Abstract: Watch time is widely used as a proxy for user satisfaction in video recommendation platforms. However, raw watch times are influenced by confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing baseline methods.

Abstract: The rapid expansion in the size of new datasets has created a need for fast and efficient parameter-learning techniques. Compressive learning is a framework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear features to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving representations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples and can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level summaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying data distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an efficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding and decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing to exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a framework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive learning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate systems than the current state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the potential of the presented Compressive Meta-Learning framework, we explore multiple applications -- including neural network-based compressive PCA, compressive ridge regression, compressive k-means, and autoencoders.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach to tackle the challenge of early forecasting of ICD codes at the beginning of a patient's stay in the hospital. By leveraging a multimodal system that combines clinical notes and tabular events from electronic health records, the model utilizes pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to optimize representation learning across modalities. Additionally, a weighted temporal loss function is proposed to dynamically adjust its contribution at each temporal point, enhancing the predictive performance of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies outperform existing state-of-the-art systems in early prediction accuracy. This advancement could have significant implications in identifying health risks, recommending effective treatments, and improving resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: While the ICD code assignment problem has been widely studied, most works have focused on post-discharge document classification. Models for early forecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks, suggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address the challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the beginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical notes and tabular events captured in electronic health records. The model integrates pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to learn optimal representations across modalities and balance their presence at every temporal point. Moreover, we present a weighted temporal loss that adjusts its contribution at each point in time. Experiments show that these strategies enhance the early prediction model, outperforming the current state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the fashion industry and the growing variety of products have made it challenging for users to find compatible items on e-commerce platforms. Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for filtering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However, simultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations remains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated independently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions between items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework named FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks and graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework constructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items, integrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit compatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically weights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture of key interactions and generating precise representations for both user preferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT outperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in precision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that combining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph structure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.

This article discusses the use of piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) in optimization problems over discrete or quantized variables, particularly in supervised learning. The authors show that in the overparameterized regime, critical points of PAR-regularized loss functions exhibit high degrees of quantization.

Abstract: Optimization problems over discrete or quantized variables are very challenging in general due to the combinatorial nature of their search space. Piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) provides a flexible modeling and computational framework for quantization based on continuous optimization. In this work, we focus on the setting of supervised learning and investigate the theoretical foundations of PAR from optimization and statistical perspectives. First, we show that in the overparameterized regime, where the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples, every critical point of the PAR-regularized loss function exhibits a high degree of quantization. Second, we derive closed-form proximal mappings for various (convex, quasi-convex, and non-convex) PARs and show how to solve PAR-regularized problems using the proximal gradient method, its accelerated variant, and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Third, we study statistical guarantees of PAR-regularized linear regression problems; specifically, we can approximate classical formulations of $\ell_1$-, squared $\ell_2$-, and nonconvex regularizations using PAR and obtain similar statistical guarantees with quantized solutions.

Summary:
Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL) is introduced as a meta-learning method for machine learning tasks that involve large-scale data from multiple distinct sources. CTRL combines cross-domain residual learning and adaptive pooling/clustering to enhance overall accuracy while maintaining source-level heterogeneity. The method addresses challenges such as distributional shifts between data sources and varying sample sizes. The paper provides theoretical insights into how CTRL manages the trade-off between data quantity and quality. Evaluation on 5 datasets, including one from the national asylum program in Switzerland, shows that CTRL outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of predictive accuracy and performance with different base learners. The algorithmic geographic assignment of asylum seekers in Switzerland is currently being piloted using this method. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) tasks often utilize large-scale data that is drawn from several distinct sources, such as different locations, treatment arms, or groups. In such settings, practitioners often desire predictions that not only exhibit good overall accuracy, but also remain reliable within each source and preserve the differences that matter across sources. For instance, several asylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment predictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host country, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions for many and often small source locations. However, this task is made challenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings: the presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between them, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources. This paper introduces Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL), a meta-learning method that combines the strengths of cross-domain residual learning and adaptive pooling/clustering in order to simultaneously improve overall accuracy and preserve source-level heterogeneity. We provide theoretical results that clarify how our objective navigates the trade-off between data quantity and data quality. We evaluate CTRL alongside other state-of-the-art benchmarks on 5 large-scale datasets. This includes a dataset from the national asylum program in Switzerland, where the algorithmic geographic assignment of asylum seekers is currently being piloted. CTRL consistently outperforms the benchmarks across several key metrics and when using a range of different base learners.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach to designing high-order Bayesian network classifiers by learning distributional representations for feature values. This method addresses the parameter explosion and data sparsity issues faced by conventional Bayesian network classifiers, allowing for better extrapolation of occurrence probabilities in complex real-world data. The proposed NeuralKDB classifier extends the K-dependence Bayesian classifier into a neural version, incorporating a neural network architecture to learn distributional representations of feature values and parameterize conditional probabilities between interdependent features. Through extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets, the NeuralKDB classifier demonstrates superior capabilities in capturing high-order feature dependencies, outperforming conventional Bayesian network classifiers and competing neural network-based classifiers lacking distributional representation learning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers provide a feasible solution to tabular data classification, with a number of merits like high time and memory efficiency, and great explainability. However, due to the parameter explosion and data sparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order feature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the occurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning distributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in word embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional representations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different features through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which then serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new test samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence Bayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e., NeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn distributional representations of feature values and parameterize the conditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic gradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model efficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing high-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional Bayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers, including two neural network based classifiers without distributional representation learning.

In the realm of Internet of Things (IoT), the generation of vast amounts of multimodal data from various sources has led to the development of edge intelligence, enabling local processing of diverse data types. To effectively handle this data, a distributed online learning framework known as Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL) has been introduced. However, the instability of IoT devices often causes imbalances in the quantity and quality of data modalities, which can hinder learning performance. In response to this challenge, the Modality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR) algorithm has been proposed to address the issues of modality imbalance during data collection. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on real-world datasets, the QQR algorithm has demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods, showcasing its efficacy in handling modality imbalance and enhancing learning outcomes.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem produces massive volumes of multimodal data from diverse sources, including sensors, cameras, and microphones. With advances in edge intelligence, IoT devices have evolved from simple data acquisition units into computationally capable nodes, enabling localized processing of heterogeneous multimodal data. This evolution necessitates distributed learning paradigms that can efficiently handle such data. Furthermore, the continuous nature of data generation and the limited storage capacity of edge devices demand an online learning framework. Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL) has emerged as a promising approach to meet these requirements. However, MMO-FL faces new challenges due to the inherent instability of IoT devices, which often results in modality quantity and quality imbalance (QQI) during data collection. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of QQI within the MMO-FL framework and present a comprehensive theoretical analysis quantifying how both types of imbalance degrade learning performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Modality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR) algorithm, a prototype learning based method designed to operate in parallel with the training process. Extensive experiments on two real-world multimodal datasets show that the proposed QQR algorithm consistently outperforms benchmarks under modality imbalance conditions with promising learning performance.

Abstract: Multi-view learning is widely applied to real-life datasets, such as multiple omics biological data, but it often suffers from both missing views and missing labels. Prior probabilistic approaches addressed the missing view problem by using a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from present views and achieved superior performance over deterministic classifiers, using the information bottleneck (IB) principle. However, the IB framework is inherently fully supervised and cannot leverage unlabeled data. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised generative model that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled samples in a unified framework. Our method maximizes the likelihood of unlabeled samples to learn a latent space shared with the IB on labeled data. We also perform cross-view mutual information maximization in the latent space to enhance the extraction of shared information across views. Compared to existing approaches, our model achieves better predictive and imputation performance on both image and multi-omics data with missing views and limited labeled samples.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Quantum Boltzmann Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE) as a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that leverages a quantum processor to efficiently sample from the Boltzmann distribution. This approach overcomes the limitations of Gaussian priors in probabilistic deep learning by capturing complex non-Gaussian data landscapes, particularly in challenging domains like complex biological data. The QBM-VAE outperforms conventional deep learning models in tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type classification, and trajectory inference, demonstrating a practical quantum advantage in deep learning on large-scale scientific problems. By incorporating a physics prior into deep learning, the model acquires scientific discovery capabilities that break through data limitations. This work serves as a blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models and showcases the potential of quantum approaches in improving the fidelity and accuracy of deep generative models for scientific research. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data, particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures, consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel modulation-based meta-learning framework for dynamics modeling that enables scalable and generalizable learning across parametric families of dynamical systems. The framework conditions structure-preserving models on compact latent representations of potentially unknown system parameters, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of system parameters and costly retraining. By applying novel modulation strategies to parametric energy-conserving and dissipative systems, the approach achieves accurate predictions in few-shot learning settings. The models maintain essential physical constraints for dynamical stability and demonstrate effective generalization performance across parameter space. Experimental results on standard benchmark problems validate the approach's ability to accurately predict system behavior and adapt to new parameter settings with minimal training data. Overall, the framework offers a promising solution for efficient and robust dynamics modeling in scenarios with varying system parameters.

Abstract: Structure-preserving approaches to dynamics modeling have demonstrated great potential for modeling physical systems due to their strong inductive biases that enforce conservation laws and dissipative behavior. However, the resulting models are typically trained for fixed system configurations, requiring explicit knowledge of system parameters as well as costly retraining for each new set of parameters -- a major limitation in many-query or parameter-varying scenarios. Meta-learning offers a potential solution, but existing approaches like optimization-based meta-learning often suffer from training instability or limited generalization capability. Inspired by ideas from computer vision, we introduce a modulation-based meta-learning framework that directly conditions structure-preserving models on compact latent representations of potentially unknown system parameters, avoiding the need for gray-box system knowledge and explicit optimization during adaptation. Through the application of novel modulation strategies to parametric energy-conserving and dissipative systems, we enable scalable and generalizable learning across parametric families of dynamical systems. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that our approach achieves accurate predictions in few-shot learning settings, without compromising on the essential physical constraints necessary for dynamical stability and effective generalization performance across parameter space.

Summary:  
The study proposes a new framework called Borrowing From the Future (BFF) for improving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments for pediatric populations. BFF is a contrastive multi-modal framework that leverages information from later stages to enhance predictions at earlier stages. By treating each time window as a distinct modality, BFF allows the model to borrow informative signals from future stages to improve performance in early risk assessments. The framework was validated on two real-world pediatric outcome prediction tasks, showing consistent improvements in early risk assessments. The code for BFF is available on GitHub for reference and further research. <div>
arXiv:2508.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk assessments for a pediatric population are often conducted across multiple stages. For example, clinicians may evaluate risks prenatally, at birth, and during Well-Child visits. Although predictions made at later stages typically achieve higher precision, it is clinically desirable to make reliable risk assessments as early as possible. Therefore, this study focuses on improving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution, \textbf{Borrowing From the Future (BFF)}, is a contrastive multi-modal framework that treats each time window as a distinct modality. In BFF, a model is trained on all available data throughout the time while performing a risk assessment using up-to-date information. This contrastive framework allows the model to ``borrow'' informative signals from later stages (e.g., Well-Child visits) to implicitly supervise the learning at earlier stages (e.g., prenatal/birth stages). We validate BFF on two real-world pediatric outcome prediction tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in early risk assessments. The code is available at https://github.com/scotsun/bff.

Abstract: Explanations of cognitive behavior often appeal to computations over representations. What does it take for a system to implement a given computation over suitable representational vehicles within that system? We argue that the language of causality -- and specifically the theory of causal abstraction -- provides a fruitful lens on this topic. Drawing on current discussions in deep learning with artificial neural networks, we illustrate how classical themes in the philosophy of computation and cognition resurface in contemporary machine learning. We offer an account of computational implementation grounded in causal abstraction, and examine the role for representation in the resulting picture. We argue that these issues are most profitably explored in connection with generalization and prediction.

<div> Keywords: air quality, PM2.5 concentration, CNN-LSTM architecture, multivariate dataset, prediction model

Summary:<br><br>
The article introduces a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for predicting PM2.5 concentration in the context of global climate change. The model combines CNN for local spatial features and LSTM for temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional models with an RMSE of 5.236. The dataset used covers hourly records of various atmospheric factors from an industrial area in Beijing. The model forecasts average PM2.5 concentration over 6-hour intervals, showing great potential for applications like air pollution early warning systems. However, its high computational demand and need for optimization in handling diverse atmospheric factors require further research. Future work aims to enhance scalability and support more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks. <div>

Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban management. To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5 concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over 6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However, due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced version of the Interactive Voting-Based Map Matching algorithm, designed to efficiently process trajectories with varying sampling rates. The main aim is to reconstruct GPS trajectories with high accuracy, independent of input data quality. Building upon the original algorithm, developed exclusively for aligning GPS signals to road networks, we extend its capabilities by integrating trajectory imputation. Our improvements also include the implementation of a distance-bounded interactive voting strategy to reduce computational complexity, as well as modifications to address missing data in the road network. Furthermore, we incorporate a custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road network.

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3) theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art GNNs.

<div> framework, closed-weight LLMs, fair classifiers, post-hoc, accuracy-fairness tradeoffs

Summary:
In this new article, a framework is proposed for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting. The LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and probabilistic predictions are used to elicit features for fair classification. The framework allows for the training of lightweight fair classifiers in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets show strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for classifiers derived from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs. The framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings or from scratch on raw tabular features. This approach addresses the challenge of enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers under the in-context learning setting, making it applicable to advanced commercial models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. <div>
arXiv:2508.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings (i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

Summary: 
- The study investigates the vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to adversarial perturbations and introduces the concept of temporal ensembling for analyzing their robustness.
- Two main challenges are identified: the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the transfer of adversarial vulnerabilities across time.
- A new training framework called Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE) is proposed to enhance the robustness of each sub-network and reduce the transferability of adversarial perturbations over time.
- RTE integrates both objectives into a unified loss function and utilizes stochastic sampling for efficient optimization.
- Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that RTE outperforms existing methods in balancing robustness and accuracy, reshaping the internal robustness landscape of SNNs for more resilient decision boundaries.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling, treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation for building robust spiking models.

<div> Keywords: graph pre-training, prompt-tuning, spectral specificity, HS-GPPT model, knowledge transfer <br>
Summary: <br>
Graph "pre-training and prompt-tuning" aims to align downstream tasks with pre-trained objectives for efficient knowledge transfer with limited supervision. However, existing methods struggle with diverse spectral distributions in real-world graphs due to varying homophily levels. The spectral specificity principle suggests that optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between pre-trained spectral filters and downstream graph spectra. The HS-GPPT model addresses this challenge by ensuring spectral alignment through both pre-training and prompt-tuning. It leverages hybrid spectral filter backbones and local-global contrastive learning to acquire comprehensive spectral knowledge. Prompts are designed to align spectral distributions with pretexts, enabling effective spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the model's effectiveness under transductive and inductive learning settings. <div>

Abstract: Graph ``pre-training and prompt-tuning'' aligns downstream tasks with pre-trained objectives to enable efficient knowledge transfer under limited supervision. However, existing methods rely on homophily-based low-frequency knowledge, failing to handle diverse spectral distributions in real-world graphs with varying homophily. Our theoretical analysis reveals a spectral specificity principle: optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between pre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs. Under limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose the HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout both pre-training and prompt-tuning. We utilize a hybrid spectral filter backbone and local-global contrastive learning to acquire abundant spectral knowledge. Then we design prompt graphs to align the spectral distribution with pretexts, facilitating spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness under both transductive and inductive learning settings. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HS-GPPT-62D2/.

Summary: <br>
RegimeNAS is introduced as a differentiable architecture search framework tailored for cryptocurrency trading with a focus on market regime awareness. It incorporates Bayesian search space optimization with provable convergence properties. The framework includes specialized neural modules for different market conditions and a multi-objective loss function with market-specific penalties. Regime identification is enhanced through multi-head attention across multiple timeframes for improved accuracy. Empirical evaluation shows that RegimeNAS outperforms existing benchmarks, reducing Mean Absolute Error by 80.3% and converging faster in fewer epochs. Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis highlight the importance of each component, especially the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This work emphasizes the necessity of integrating domain-specific knowledge, such as market regimes, into architecture search processes to create robust and adaptive models for complex financial applications. <br> <div>

Abstract: We introduce RegimeNAS, a novel differentiable architecture search framework specifically designed to enhance cryptocurrency trading performance by explicitly integrating market regime awareness. Addressing the limitations of static deep learning models in highly dynamic financial environments, RegimeNAS features three core innovations: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian search space optimizing architectures with provable convergence properties; (2) specialized, dynamically activated neural modules (Volatility, Trend, and Range blocks) tailored for distinct market conditions; and (3) a multi-objective loss function incorporating market-specific penalties (e.g., volatility matching, transition smoothness) alongside mathematically enforced Lipschitz stability constraints. Regime identification leverages multi-head attention across multiple timeframes for improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Rigorous empirical evaluation on extensive real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrates that RegimeNAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving an 80.3% Mean Absolute Error reduction compared to the best traditional recurrent baseline and converging substantially faster (9 vs. 50+ epochs). Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis confirm the critical contribution of each component, particularly the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This work underscores the imperative of embedding domain-specific knowledge, such as market regimes, directly within the NAS process to develop robust and adaptive models for challenging financial applications.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification that converts a pretrained model's point prediction into a prediction set, with the set size reflecting the model's confidence. Although existing CP methods are guaranteed to achieve marginal coverage, they often exhibit imbalanced coverage across classes under long-tail label distributions, tending to over cover the head classes at the expense of under covering the remaining tail classes. This under coverage is particularly concerning, as it undermines the reliability of the prediction sets for minority classes, even with coverage ensured on average. In this paper, we propose the Tail-Aware Conformal Prediction (TACP) method to mitigate the under coverage of the tail classes by utilizing the long-tail structure and narrowing the head-tail coverage gap. Theoretical analysis shows that it consistently achieves a smaller head-tail coverage gap than standard methods. To further improve coverage balance across all classes, we introduce an extension of TACP: soft TACP (sTACP) via a reweighting mechanism. The proposed framework can be combined with various non-conformity scores, and experiments on multiple long-tail benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Abstract: With the growing incorporation of deep neural network (DNN) models into modern software systems, the prohibitive construction costs have become a significant challenge. Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training costs, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant inference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention, enabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging modularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization into training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However, existing MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional kernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models, particularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose NeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron level fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to Transformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based modular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling scalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two Transformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets demonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods. Results show average gains of 1.72% in module classification accuracy and 58.10% reduction in module size, demonstrating efficacy across both CNN and large-scale Transformer-based models. A case study on open-source projects shows NeMo's potential benefits in practical scenarios, offering a promising approach for scalable and generalizable DNN modularization.

Abstract: Afforestation and reforestation are popular strategies for mitigating climate change by enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years. Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place. In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope satellite images.

Abstract: Many real-world data are sequentially collected over time and often exhibit skewed class distributions, resulting in imbalanced data streams. While existing approaches have explored several strategies, such as resampling and reweighting, for imbalanced data stream learning, our work distinguishes itself by addressing the imbalance problem through training modification, particularly focusing on gradient descent techniques. We introduce the harmonized gradient descent (HGD) algorithm, which aims to equalize the norms of gradients across different classes. By ensuring the gradient norm balance, HGD mitigates under-fitting for minor classes and achieves balanced online learning. Notably, HGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer, extra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning models utilizing gradient descent for optimization. Theoretical analysis, based on a few common and mild assumptions, shows that HGD achieves a satisfied sub-linear regret bound. The proposed algorithm are compared with the commonly used online imbalance learning methods under several imbalanced data stream scenarios. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HGD in learning imbalanced data streams.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.

Summary: <br> 
The paper introduces PTSM, a novel framework for EEG decoding across different subjects in brain-computer interface research. PTSM utilizes personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns through dual-branch masking to capture individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant features. By factorizing masks across temporal and spatial dimensions, PTSM can modulate dynamic EEG patterns efficiently. Information-theoretic constraints are enforced to separate latent embeddings into task-related and subject-related subspaces, improving zero-shot generalization. The model is trained end-to-end with a multi-objective loss function, incorporating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Experimental results on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate PTSM's superior performance compared to existing methods, showcasing the effectiveness of disentangled neural representations for personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings. <div>

Abstract: Cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) decoding remains a fundamental challenge in brain-computer interface (BCI) research due to substantial inter-subject variability and the scarcity of subject-invariant representations. This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.

Summary:<br>
- The article introduces Dual-Feedback Actor (DFA), a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates individual rewards and pairwise preferences for a unified update rule.
- DFA uses policy log-probabilities to model preference probability directly, eliminating the need for a separate reward-modeling step.
- Preferences can be provided by human annotators or synthesized from stored Q-values in an off-policy replay buffer.
- DFA's preference loss minimization leads to the recovery of the entropy-regularized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy under a Bradley-Terry model.
- Simulation results demonstrate that DFA outperforms SAC on various control environments and exhibits a more stable training process.
- Even with a semi-synthetic preference dataset, DFA surpasses reward-modeling reinforcement learning baselines in a stochastic GridWorld and approaches the performance of an oracle with true rewards.

Abstract: We present Dual-Feedback Actor (DFA), a reinforcement learning algorithm that fuses both individual rewards and pairwise preferences (if available) into a single update rule. DFA uses the policy's log-probabilities directly to model the preference probability, avoiding a separate reward-modeling step. Preferences can be provided by human-annotators (at state-level or trajectory-level) or be synthesized online from Q-values stored in an off-policy replay buffer. Under a Bradley-Terry model, we prove that minimizing DFA's preference loss recovers the entropy-regularized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy. Our simulation results show that DFA trained on generated preferences matches or exceeds SAC on six control environments and demonstrates a more stable training process. With only a semi-synthetic preference dataset under Bradley-Terry model, our algorithm outperforms reward-modeling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) baselines in a stochastic GridWorld and approaches the performance of an oracle with true rewards.

<br>
Summary:<br>
The paper discusses Decision-focused learning (DFL), which aims to train ML models to predict optimization problem parameters to minimize decision regret and maximize decision quality. It highlights the challenges in computing the gradient in optimization problems like linear programs where the regret gradient is zero in most cases. Existing approaches either smooth the problem or minimize surrogate losses to address this issue. The paper proposes minimizing surrogate losses even when a differentiable optimization layer is used, showing comparable or better regret results than existing methods. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach with DYS-Net, a differentiable optimization technique for LPs. By minimizing surrogate losses with DYS-Net, the study achieves state-of-the-art regret levels while significantly reducing training time. <div>
arXiv:2508.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) trains a machine learning (ML) model to predict parameters of an optimization problem, to directly minimize decision regret, i.e., maximize decision quality. Gradient-based DFL requires computing the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs, that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.

Summary: <br>
This article introduces a structural lifting strategy for Graph Neural Networks using Forman-Ricci curvature to capture higher-order topological domains. Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses complex interactions in real-world networks by transforming basic graph forms to more expressive topologies. Forman-Ricci curvature reveals local and global graph properties, highlighting backbones that form connections between major communities. These backbones, represented as hyperedges, help model information flows between clusters across large distances, preventing information distortion and graph bottlenecks. The proposed approach aims to remedy the problem of over-squashing in message passing across long distances, enhancing the performance of GNN models in capturing complex network structures. <br> <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks are highly effective at learning from relational data, leveraging node and edge features while maintaining the symmetries inherent to graph structures. However, many real-world systems, such as social or biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.

<div> Keywords: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, CHORD framework, Off-policy versus On-policy

Summary: <br><br> The study introduces the CHORD framework, which integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs). CHORD reframes SFT as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within on-policy RL and incorporates a dual-control mechanism to balance off-policy imitation and on-policy exploration. By utilizing a global coefficient and token-wise weighting function, CHORD effectively harmonizes expert data with exploration, leading to stable and efficient learning processes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CHORD outperforms baseline methods, showcasing significant improvements in performance. The implementation of CHORD is made available on GitHub to facilitate further research in this area. <div>
arXiv:2508.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over baselines. We release the implementation at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to inspire further research.

<div> Keywords: deep generative models, antibody sequence, structure optimization, latent space, property optimization<br>
<br>
Summary: <br>
Advancements in deep generative models have allowed for the joint modeling of antibody sequence and structure, with the antigen-antibody complex as context. However, current methods for optimizing complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are inefficient due to costly evaluations in the raw data space. To address this issue, the LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD) framework is proposed, optimizing sequence and structure within a shared latent space. By optimizing shared latent codes, LEAD overcomes limitations of existing methods and ensures sync between different modality designs. A black-box guidance strategy is designed for scenarios where property evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results show that LEAD outperforms baseline methods in property optimization, reducing query consumption by half. The code for LEAD is available at https://github.com/EvaFlower/LatEnt-blAck-box-Design. <br> <div>

Abstract: Advancements in deep generative models have enabled the joint modeling of antibody sequence and structure, given the antigen-antibody complex as context. However, existing approaches for optimizing complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to improve developability properties operate in the raw data space, leading to excessively costly evaluations due to the inefficient search process. To address this, we propose LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD), a sequence-structure co-design framework that optimizes both sequence and structure within their shared latent space. Optimizing shared latent codes can not only break through the limitations of existing methods, but also ensure synchronization of different modality designs. Particularly, we design a black-box guidance strategy to accommodate real-world scenarios where many property evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results demonstrate that our LEAD achieves superior optimization performance for both single and multi-property objectives. Notably, LEAD reduces query consumption by a half while surpassing baseline methods in property optimization. The code is available at https://github.com/EvaFlower/LatEnt-blAck-box-Design.

Summary:
Contractive Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) leverage contraction theory to enhance robustness against input noise and adversarial attacks. By inducing contractivity during training through regularization terms related to the system dynamics, these networks exhibit improved resilience to slight input perturbations. Weight regularization techniques can also be employed to promote contractivity, particularly for NODEs with restricted activation function slopes, while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization methods in enhancing the robustness of Contractive Convolutional NODEs against various forms of noise and attacks.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

Summary:<br> 
The article introduces mCOCO, a framework that uses Reservoir Computing to learn population-level functional Connectional Brain Templates (CBTs) from BOLD signals. mCOCO addresses limitations of existing methods by enhancing interpretability, tracking state changes, and modeling brain dynamics. It integrates multi-sensory inputs to capture how brain regions process information and adapt to cognitive tasks efficiently. The framework involves mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional connectomes and aggregating them into a group-level CBT. It then incorporates multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive reservoir to endow the CBT with cognitive traits, enhancing its performance in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory memory retention compared to GNN-based CBT. The source code is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br> <div>
arXiv:2508.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC) to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases: (1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory memory retention. Our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/mCOCO.

<br>
Summary: In this paper, the authors propose a learning-theory-based framework to evaluate the informativeness of explanations provided by local post-hoc explanation algorithms for complex machine learning models. They define an explanation as informative if it reduces the complexity of plausible decision functions. The study demonstrates that popular explanation algorithms may not be informative when applied to complex decision functions, offering a mathematical rejection of the assumption that all models can be explained. The authors establish conditions under which different explanation algorithms become informative and reveal that modifications may be necessary to achieve informativeness. For example, gradient and counterfactual explanations are non-informative for differentiable functions, while SHAP and anchor explanations lack informativeness for decision trees. These findings have significant implications for the practical applicability of explanation algorithms in auditing, regulation, and high-risk AI applications. <br> <div>
arXiv:2508.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many researchers have suggested that local post-hoc explanation algorithms can be used to gain insights into the behavior of complex machine learning models. However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for simple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which assumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we introduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an explanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an explanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of plausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular explanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision functions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it should be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which different explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger than what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and counterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of differentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative with respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss how explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative. While the proposed analysis of explanation algorithms is mathematical, we argue that it holds strong implications for the practical applicability of these algorithms, particularly for auditing, regulation, and high-risk applications of AI.

Summary:
This study investigates six probabilistic machine learning algorithms on their ability to estimate class probability and uncertainty. Through rigorous testing on synthetic datasets, the algorithms were evaluated for properties such as calibration and the ability to reflect uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. The findings reveal that all algorithms were well calibrated, but deep learning-based algorithms did not consistently provide uncertainties that accurately reflected evidence for out-of-distribution data points. The study serves as a valuable example for researchers working on uncertainty estimation in data-driven modeling for scientific discoveries. <div>

Abstract: Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with accompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery, especially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such as deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly difficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study, we use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with empirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to investigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine learning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a neural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss, (iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo Dropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process mixture model. We check if the algorithms produce uncertainty estimates which reflect commonly desired properties, such as being well calibrated and exhibiting an increase in uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. Our results indicate that all algorithms are well calibrated, but none of the deep learning based algorithms provide uncertainties that consistently reflect lack of experimental evidence for out-of-distribution data points. We hope our study may serve as a clarifying example for researchers developing new methods of uncertainty estimation for scientific data-driven modeling.

Abstract: Motor vehicle crashes remain a leading cause of injury and death worldwide, necessitating data-driven approaches to understand and mitigate crash severity. This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3 million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human, and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance, this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.

Abstract: Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.

Abstract: The growing deployment of decision-making agents in dynamic environments increases the demand for safety verification. While critical testing scenario generation has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively balancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing methods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional scenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided testing framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior space, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and criticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical representation framework combines dimensionality reduction and multi-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and critical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation modes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario quantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space, agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral criticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming a closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and exploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves critical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\% and demonstrates greater diversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five decision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep, non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise recursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We validate our results with numerical experiments.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users still regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainable artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up, learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts, data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs; our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles, this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel, end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AI deployment.

<title>DFed-SST: Building Semantic- and Structure-aware Topologies for Decentralized Federated Graph Learning</title>

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a robust distributed paradigm that circumvents the single-point-of-failure and communication bottleneck risks of centralized architectures. However, a significant challenge arises as existing DFL optimization strategies, primarily designed for tasks such as computer vision, fail to address the unique topological information inherent in the local subgraph. Notably, while Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is tailored for graph data, it is predominantly implemented in a centralized server-client model, failing to leverage the benefits of decentralization.To bridge this gap, we propose DFed-SST, a decentralized federated graph learning framework with adaptive communication. The core of our method is a dual-topology adaptive communication mechanism that leverages the unique topological features of each client's local subgraph to dynamically construct and optimize the inter-client communication topology. This allows our framework to guide model aggregation efficiently in the face of heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of DFed-SST, achieving 3.26% improvement in average accuracy over baseline methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time. Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.

Abstract: We introduce SeamlessFlow, a server based reinforcement learning (RL) framework that addresses two core challenges in industrial scale RL: (1) decoupling RL training from the complex execution flow of agents; (2) maximizing GPU utilization with minimal idle time while preserving the stability and scalability required for large-scale deployments. First, SeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from diverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A central trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and supports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and resume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we propose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into capability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated architectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal multiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout in a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully exploiting heterogeneous cluster resources. By combining these innovations, SeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well suited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.

<title>Optimal CO2 storage management considering safety constraints in multi-stakeholder multi-site CCS projects: a game theoretic perspective</title>

Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array of stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each with different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale, and long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual stakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether collaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for effective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often implemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features such as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive behavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located in geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon extraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing infrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and unrealistic.
  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively investigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of stakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our approach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety regulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2 into their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To address the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity models, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control (E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when multiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that common complex diseases with the same or similar clinical manifestations could have different underlying genetic etiologies. While current research interests have shifted toward uncovering rare variants and structural variations predisposing to human diseases, the impact of heterogeneity in genetic studies of complex diseases has been largely overlooked. Most of the existing statistical methods assume the disease under investigation has a homogeneous genetic effect and could, therefore, have low power if the disease undergoes heterogeneous pathophysiological and etiological processes. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneity weighted U (HWU) method for association analyses considering genetic heterogeneity. HWU can be applied to various types of phenotypes (e.g., binary and continuous) and is computationally effcient for high- dimensional genetic data. Through simulations, we showed the advantage of HWU when the underlying genetic etiology of a disease was heterogeneous, as well as the robustness of HWU against different model assumptions (e.g., phenotype distributions). Using HWU, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of nicotine dependence from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environments (SAGE) dataset. The genome-wide analysis of nearly one million genetic markers took 7 hours, identifying heterogeneous effects of two new genes (i.e., CYP3A5 and IKBKB) on nicotine dependence.

Abstract: Sequencing-based studies are emerging as a major tool for genetic association studies of complex diseases. These studies pose great challenges to the traditional statistical methods (e.g., single-locus analyses based on regression methods) because of the high-dimensionality of data and the low frequency of genetic variants. In addition, there is a great interest in biology and epidemiology to identify genetic risk factors contributed to multiple disease phenotypes. The multiple phenotypes can often follow different distributions, which violates the assumptions of most current methods. In this paper, we propose a generalized similarity U test, referred to as GSU. GSU is a similarity-based test and can handle high-dimensional genotypes and phenotypes. We studied the theoretical properties of GSU, and provided the efficient p-value calculation for association test as well as the sample size and power calculation for the study design. Through simulation, we found that GSU had advantages over existing methods in terms of power and robustness to phenotype distributions. Finally, we used GSU to perform a multivariate analysis of sequencing data in the Dallas Heart Study and identified a joint association of 4 genes with 5 metabolic related phenotypes.

Abstract: With advancements in next generation sequencing technology, a massive amount of sequencing data are generated, offering a great opportunity to comprehensively investigate the role of rare variants in the genetic etiology of complex diseases. Nevertheless, this poses a great challenge for the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data. The association analyses based on traditional statistical methods suffer substantial power loss because of the low frequency of genetic variants and the extremely high dimensionality of the data. We developed a weighted U statistic, referred to as WU-seq, for the high-dimensional association analysis of sequencing data. Based on a non-parametric U statistic, WU-SEQ makes no assumption of the underlying disease model and phenotype distribution, and can be applied to a variety of phenotypes. Through simulation studies and an empirical study, we showed that WU-SEQ outperformed a commonly used SKAT method when the underlying assumptions were violated (e.g., the phenotype followed a heavy-tailed distribution). Even when the assumptions were satisfied, WU-SEQ still attained comparable performance to SKAT. Finally, we applied WU-seq to sequencing data from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), and detected an association between ANGPTL 4 and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Abstract: Common complex diseases are likely influenced by the interplay of hundreds, or even thousands, of genetic variants. Converging evidence shows that genetic variants with low marginal effects (LME) play an important role in disease development. Despite their potential significance, discovering LME genetic variants and assessing their joint association on high dimensional data (e.g., genome wide association studies) remain a great challenge. To facilitate joint association analysis among a large ensemble of LME genetic variants, we proposed a computationally efficient and powerful approach, which we call Trees Assembling Mann whitney (TAMW). Through simulation studies and an empirical data application, we found that TAMW outperformed multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and the likelihood ratio based Mann whitney approach (LRMW) when the underlying complex disease involves multiple LME loci and their interactions. For instance, in a simulation with 20 interacting LME loci, TAMW attained a higher power (power=0.931) than both MDR (power=0.599) and LRMW (power=0.704). In an empirical study of 29 known Crohn's disease (CD) loci, TAMW also identified a stronger joint association with CD than those detected by MDR and LRMW. Finally, we applied TAMW to Wellcome Trust CD GWAS to conduct a genome wide analysis. The analysis of 459K single nucleotide polymorphisms was completed in 40 hours using parallel computing, and revealed a joint association predisposing to CD (p-value=2.763e-19). Further analysis of the newly discovered association suggested that 13 genes, such as ATG16L1 and LACC1, may play an important role in CD pathophysiological and etiological processes.

Abstract: Second generation sequencing technologies are being increasingly used for genetic association studies, where the main research interest is to identify sets of genetic variants that contribute to various phenotype. The phenotype can be univariate disease status, multivariate responses and even high-dimensional outcomes. Considering the genotype and phenotype as two complex objects, this also poses a general statistical problem of testing association between complex objects. We here proposed a similarity-based test, generalized similarity U (GSU), that can test the association between complex objects. We first studied the theoretical properties of the test in a general setting and then focused on the application of the test to sequencing association studies. Based on theoretical analysis, we proposed to use Laplacian kernel based similarity for GSU to boost power and enhance robustness. Through simulation, we found that GSU did have advantages over existing methods in terms of power and robustness. We further performed a whole genome sequencing (WGS) scan for Alzherimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, identifying three genes, APOE, APOC1 and TOMM40, associated with imaging phenotype. We developed a C++ package for analysis of whole genome sequencing data using GSU. The source codes can be downloaded at https://github.com/changshuaiwei/gsu.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced global weather forecasting, outperforming traditional numerical models in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Nevertheless, extending predictions beyond subseasonal timescales requires the development of deep learning (DL)-based ocean-atmosphere coupled models that can realistically simulate complex oceanic responses to atmospheric forcing. This study presents KIST-Ocean, a DL-based global three-dimensional ocean general circulation model using a U-shaped visual attention adversarial network architecture. KIST-Ocean integrates partial convolution, adversarial training, and transfer learning to address coastal complexity and predictive distribution drift in auto-regressive models. Comprehensive evaluations confirmed the model's robust ocean predictive skill and efficiency. Moreover, it accurately captures realistic ocean response, such as Kelvin and Rossby wave propagation in the tropical Pacific, and vertical motions induced by cyclonic and anticyclonic wind stress, demonstrating its ability to represent key ocean-atmosphere coupling mechanisms underlying climate phenomena, including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. These findings reinforce confidence in DL-based global weather and climate models and their extending DL-based approaches to broader Earth system modeling, offering potential for enhancing climate prediction capabilities.

Abstract: Indigenous communities face ongoing challenges in preserving their cultural heritage, particularly in the face of systemic marginalization and urban development. In Brazil, the Museu Nacional dos Povos Indigenas through the Tainacan platform hosts the country's largest online collection of Indigenous objects and iconographies, providing a critical resource for cultural engagement. Using publicly available data from this repository, we present a data-driven initiative that applies artificial intelligence to enhance accessibility, interpretation, and exploration. We develop two semantic pipelines: a visual pipeline that models image-based similarity and a textual pipeline that captures semantic relationships from item descriptions. These embedding spaces are projected into two dimensions and integrated into an interactive visualization tool we also developed. In addition to similarity-based navigation, users can explore the collection through temporal and geographic lenses, enabling both semantic and contextualized perspectives. The system supports curatorial tasks, aids public engagement, and reveals latent connections within the collection. This work demonstrates how AI can ethically contribute to cultural preservation practices.

Abstract: As the demand for more efficient and adaptive computing grows, nature-inspired architectures offer promising alternatives to conventional electronic designs. Microfluidic platforms, drawing on biological forms and fluid dynamics, present a compelling foundation for low-power, high-resilience computing in environments where electronics are unsuitable. This study explores a hybrid reservoir computing system based on a dragonfly-wing inspired microfluidic chip, which encodes temporal input patterns as fluid interactions within the micro channel network.
  The system operates with three dye-based inlet channels and three camera-monitored detection areas, transforming discrete spatial patterns into dynamic color output signals. These reservoir output signals are then modified and passed to a simple and trainable readout layer for pattern classification. Using a combination of raw reservoir outputs and synthetically generated outputs, we evaluated system performance, system clarity, and data efficiency. The results demonstrate consistent classification accuracies up to $91\%$, even with coarse resolution and limited training data, highlighting the viability of the microfluidic reservoir computing.

Abstract: Identifying risks associated with a company is important to investors and the well-being of the overall financial market. In this study, we build a computational framework to automatically extract company risk factors from news articles. Our newly proposed schema comprises seven distinct aspects, such as supply chain, regulations, and competitions. We sample and annotate 744 news articles and benchmark various machine learning models. While large language models have achieved huge progress in various types of NLP tasks, our experiment shows that zero-shot and few-shot prompting state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g. LLaMA-2) can only achieve moderate to low performances in identifying risk factors. And fine-tuned pre-trained language models are performing better on most of the risk factors. Using this model, we analyze over 277K Bloomberg news articles and demonstrate that identifying risk factors from news could provide extensive insight into the operations of companies and industries.

Abstract: Cardiotocography (CTG) is essential for fetal monitoring but is frequently compromised by diverse artefacts which obscure true fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns and can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed intervention. Current deep-learning approaches typically bypass comprehensive noise handling, applying minimal preprocessing or focusing solely on downstream classification, while traditional methods rely on simple interpolation or rule-based filtering that addresses only missing samples and fail to correct complex artefact types. We present CleanCTG, an end-to-end dual-stage model that first identifies multiple artefact types via multi-scale convolution and context-aware cross-attention, then reconstructs corrupted segments through artefact-specific correction branches. Training utilised over 800,000 minutes of physiologically realistic, synthetically corrupted CTGs derived from expert-verified "clean" recordings. On synthetic data, CleanCTG achieved perfect artefact detection (AU-ROC = 1.00) and reduced mean squared error (MSE) on corrupted segments to 2.74 x 10^-4 (clean-segment MSE = 2.40 x 10^-6), outperforming the next best method by more than 60%. External validation on 10,190 minutes of clinician-annotated segments yielded AU-ROC = 0.95 (sensitivity = 83.44%, specificity 94.22%), surpassing six comparator classifiers. Finally, when integrated with the Dawes-Redman system on 933 clinical CTG recordings, denoised traces increased specificity (from 80.70% to 82.70%) and shortened median time to decision by 33%. These findings suggest that explicit artefact removal and signal reconstruction can both maintain diagnostic accuracy and enable shorter monitoring sessions, offering a practical route to more reliable CTG interpretation.

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision, remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA) Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary detection or annotation pipelines.

Abstract: Learning and generating various types of data based on conditional diffusion models has been a research hotspot in recent years. Although conditional diffusion models have made considerable progress in improving acceleration algorithms and enhancing generation quality, the lack of non-asymptotic properties has hindered theoretical research. To address this gap, we focus on a conditional diffusion model within the domains of classification and regression (CARD), which aims to learn the original distribution with given input x (denoted as Y|X). It innovatively integrates a pre-trained model f_{\phi}(x) into the original diffusion model framework, allowing it to precisely capture the original conditional distribution given f (expressed as Y|f_{\phi}(x)). Remarkably, when f_{\phi}(x) performs satisfactorily, Y|f_{\phi}(x) closely approximates Y|X. Theoretically, we deduce the stochastic differential equations of CARD and establish its generalized form predicated on the Fokker-Planck equation, thereby erecting a firm theoretical foundation for analysis. Mainly under the Lipschitz assumptions, we utilize the second-order Wasserstein distance to demonstrate the upper error bound between the original and the generated conditional distributions. Additionally, by appending assumptions such as light-tailedness to the original distribution, we derive the convergence upper bound between the true value analogous to the score function and the corresponding network-estimated value.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection, Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000 frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable, offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at https://smlab.niser.ac.in/project/iwatchroad

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDMs) have recently gained traction as a viable generative framework for natural language. This can be attributed to its scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general, have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative to autoregressive language models. Additionally, we show that a simple soft-value-based verifier setup for MDMs using off-the-shelf pre-trained embedding models leads to significant gains in generation quality even when used on top of typical classifier-free guidance setups in the existing literature.

Abstract: We propose a Buckley James (BJ) Boost Q learning framework for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes under right censored survival data, tailored for longitudinal randomized clinical trial settings. The method integrates accelerated failure time models with iterative boosting techniques, including componentwise least squares and regression trees, within a counterfactual Q learning framework. By directly modeling conditional survival time, BJ Boost Q learning avoids the restrictive proportional hazards assumption and enables unbiased estimation of stage specific Q functions. Grounded in potential outcomes, this framework ensures identifiability of the optimal treatment regime under standard causal assumptions. Compared to Cox based Q learning, which relies on hazard modeling and may suffer from bias under misspecification, our approach provides robust and flexible estimation. Simulation studies and analysis of the ACTG175 HIV trial demonstrate that BJ Boost Q learning yields higher accuracy in treatment decision making, especially in multistage settings where bias can accumulate.

Abstract: A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach leverages generative AI to enhance personalized learning by directly integrating student feedback into AI-generated solutions. Students critique and modify AI responses using predefined feedback tags, fostering deeper engagement and understanding. This empowers students to actively shape their learning, with AI serving as an adaptive partner. The system uses a tagging technique and prompt engineering to personalize content, informing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant educational material and adjust explanations in real time. This builds on existing research in adaptive learning, demonstrating how student-driven feedback loops can modify AI-generated responses for improved student retention and engagement, particularly in STEM education. Preliminary findings from a study with STEM students indicate improved learning outcomes and confidence compared to traditional AI tools. This work highlights AI's potential to create dynamic, feedback-driven, and personalized learning environments through iterative refinement.

Abstract: While progress has been made in identifying common genetic variants associated with human diseases, for most of common complex diseases, the identified genetic variants only account for a small proportion of heritability. Challenges remain in finding additional unknown genetic variants predisposing to complex diseases. With the advance in next-generation sequencing technologies, sequencing studies have become commonplace in genetic research. The ongoing exome-sequencing and whole-genome-sequencing studies generate a massive amount of sequencing variants and allow researchers to comprehensively investigate their role in human diseases. The discovery of new disease-associated variants can be enhanced by utilizing powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods. In this paper, we propose a functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) method for testing an association of sequence variants in a genomic region with a qualitative trait. The FANOVA has a number of advantages: (1) it tests for a joint effect of gene variants, including both common and rare; (2) it fully utilizes linkage disequilibrium and genetic position information; and (3) allows for either protective or risk-increasing causal variants. Through simulations, we show that FANOVA outperform two popularly used methods - SKAT and a previously proposed method based on functional linear models (FLM), - especially if a sample size of a study is small and/or sequence variants have low to moderate effects. We conduct an empirical study by applying three methods (FANOVA, SKAT and FLM) to sequencing data from Dallas Heart Study. While SKAT and FLM respectively detected ANGPTL 4 and ANGPTL 3 associated with obesity, FANOVA was able to identify both genes associated with obesity.

<title>Learn to optimize for automatic proton PBS treatment planning for H&amp;N cancers</title>

Abstract: Proton PBS treatment planning for H&amp;N cancers involves numerous conflicting objectives, requiring significant effort from human planners to balance and satisfy multiple clinical goals during planning. To achieve this, experience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally expensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts have been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most time-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on theory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and integrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to automatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning time. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by learning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we integrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed for LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability issue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy network, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based on objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in this study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves the effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In conjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our framework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR sparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription dose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with human-generated plans.

Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art (SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than $45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at https://github.com/abhi1kumar/CHARM3R

Abstract: Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches. While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first polynomial convergence rates for Gaussian kernel ridge regression (KRR) with a fixed hyperparameter in both the uniform and the $L^{2}$-norm. The uniform convergence result closes a gap in the theoretical understanding of KRR with the Gaussian kernel, where no such rates were previously known. In addition, we prove a polynomial $L^{2}$-convergence rate in the case, where the Gaussian kernel's width parameter is fixed. This also contributes to the broader understanding of smooth kernels, for which previously only sub-polynomial $L^{2}$-rates were known in similar settings. Together, these results provide new theoretical justification for the use of Gaussian KRR with fixed hyperparameters in nonparametric regression.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.

Abstract: While deploying large language models on edge devices promises low-latency and privacy-preserving AI services, it is hindered by limited device resources. Although pipeline parallelism facilitates distributed inference, existing approaches often ignore the cold-start latency caused by on-demand model loading. In this paper, we propose a latency-aware scheduling framework that overlaps model loading with computation and communication to minimize total inference latency. Based on device and model parameters, the framework dynamically adjusts layer partitioning and allocation to effectively hide loading time, thereby eliminating as many idle periods as possible. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program and design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to optimize model partitioning and device assignment. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces cold-start latency compared to baseline strategies.

Abstract: The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.

Abstract: This article explores novel data-driven modeling approaches for analyzing and approximating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a physiologically-based metric integrating multiple atmospheric variables to assess thermal comfort. Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we investigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for interpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front of accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient structures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data, our models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent performance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the UTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near the theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these findings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental modeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain consistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these results illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic structure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental indices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximation in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically, MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH addiction.

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability, reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities and relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs. However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR, 1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive embedding dimensions in CKGE. The codes of SAGE are publicly available at: https://github.com/lyfxjtu/Dynamic-Embedding.

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art, segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets. Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification, domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code is available at: [link to be added after the paper is accepted]

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices. Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions, Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy, thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations. Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Abstract: Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are more broadly applicable to different input types.

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end differentiable training paradigm for stable training of a rationalized transformer classifier. Our approach results in a single model that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on their relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used three-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on training a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We simplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles, leading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the common training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we extend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating recent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales, thus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with human annotations without any explicit supervision.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels. Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training, introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly available at https: //github.com/Kainmueller-Lab/self_adapt.

<title>RMSL: Weakly-Supervised Insider Threat Detection with Robust Multi-sphere Learning</title>

Abstract: Insider threat detection aims to identify malicious user behavior by analyzing logs that record user interactions. Due to the lack of fine-grained behavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within user behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false positive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and anomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior sequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to enhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning discriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called Robust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to represent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier is constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on this, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level self-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework further refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak sequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMSL significantly improves the performance of behavior-level insider threat detection.

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR performance for historical manuscripts.

Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However, the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics, which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a critical step towards deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

Abstract: Deep Learning has emerged as a promising approach for skin lesion analysis. However, existing methods mostly rely on fully supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled data, which is challenging and costly to obtain. To alleviate this annotation burden, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised deep learning approach that integrates ensemble learning with online knowledge distillation for enhanced skin lesion classification. Our methodology involves training an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online knowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members. This process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble, thereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself. Post-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test time, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the ensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual model performs better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on both the \emph{International Skin Imaging Collaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing current state-of-the-art results. By leveraging ensemble learning and online knowledge distillation, our method reduces the need for extensive labeled data while providing a more resource-efficient solution for skin lesion classification in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction capability and classification performance while reducing computational complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module, termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead. Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance. Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs, exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging analysis models.

Abstract: Determining the optimal data mixture for large language model training remains a challenging problem with an outsized impact on performance. In practice, language model developers continue to rely on heuristic exploration since no learning-based approach has emerged as a reliable solution. In this work, we propose to view the selection of training data mixtures as a black-box hyperparameter optimization problem, for which Bayesian Optimization is a well-established class of appropriate algorithms. Firstly, we cast data mixture learning as a sequential decision-making problem, in which we aim to find a suitable trade-off between the computational cost of training exploratory (proxy-) models and final mixture performance. Secondly, we systematically explore the properties of transferring mixtures learned at a small scale to larger-scale experiments, providing insights and highlighting opportunities for research at a modest scale. By proposing Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization as a suitable method in this common scenario, we introduce a natural framework to balance experiment cost with model fit, avoiding the risks of overfitting to smaller scales while minimizing the number of experiments at high cost. We present results for pre-training and instruction finetuning across models ranging from 1 million to 7 billion parameters, varying from simple architectures to state-of-the-art models and benchmarks spanning dozens of datasets. We demonstrate consistently strong results relative to a wide range of benchmarks, showingspeed-ups of over 500% in determining the best data mixture on our largest experiments relative to recent baselines. In addition, we broaden access to research by sharing ADMIRE IFT Runs, a dataset of 460 full training & evaluation runs across various model sizes worth over 13,000 GPU hours, greatly reducing the cost of conducting research in this area.

Abstract: Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.

Abstract: Effective and efficient agricultural manipulation and harvesting depend on accurately understanding the current state of the grasp. The agricultural environment presents unique challenges due to its complexity, clutter, and occlusion. Additionally, fruit is physically attached to the plant, requiring precise separation during harvesting. Selecting appropriate sensors and modeling techniques is critical for obtaining reliable feedback and correctly identifying grasp states. This work investigates a set of key sensors, namely inertial measurement units (IMUs), infrared (IR) reflectance, tension, tactile sensors, and RGB cameras, integrated into a compliant gripper to classify grasp states. We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare the performance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest classifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherry tomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, and successful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance. Furthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU and tension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states. This classifier enables the planning of corrective actions based on real-time feedback, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of fruit harvesting operations.

<title>Nonparametric learning of stochastic differential equations from sparse and noisy data</title>

Abstract: The paper proposes a systematic framework for building data-driven stochastic differential equation (SDE) models from sparse, noisy observations. Unlike traditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the drift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data without strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in scientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly complex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized negative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory segments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte Carlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized empirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a finite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer theorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a hybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify significant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish important theoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EM sequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation of the drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and is broadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling under observational constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a series of numerical experiments.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.

Abstract: While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains. Code of all experiments and benchmarks is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-pfl4asr.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has catalyzed revolutionary changes across various sectors, notably in healthcare. In particular, generative AI-led by diffusion models and transformer architectures-has enabled significant breakthroughs in medical imaging (including image reconstruction, image-to-image translation, generation, and classification), protein structure prediction, clinical documentation, diagnostic assistance, radiology interpretation, clinical decision support, medical coding, and billing, as well as drug design and molecular representation. These innovations have enhanced clinical diagnosis, data reconstruction, and drug synthesis. This review paper aims to offer a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in healthcare applications of generative AI, with an emphasis on diffusion and transformer models. Moreover, we discuss current capabilities, highlight existing limitations, and outline promising research directions to address emerging challenges. Serving as both a reference for researchers and a guide for practitioners, this work offers an integrated view of the state of the art, its impact on healthcare, and its future potential.

<title>JMA: a General Algorithm to Craft Nearly Optimal Targeted Adversarial Example</title>

Abstract: Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of distribution shifts on non-homophilous graphs Mosting existing graph neural network methods rely on the homophilous assumption that nodes from the same class are more likely to be linked. However, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold in real-world graphs, which leads to more complex distribution shifts unaccounted for in previous methods. The distribution shifts of neighborhood patterns are much more diverse on non-homophilous graphs. We propose a novel Invariant Neighborhood Pattern Learning (INPL) to alleviate the distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Neighborhood Propagation (ANP) module to capture the adaptive neighborhood information, which could alleviate the neighborhood pattern distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. We propose Invariant Non-Homophilous Graph Learning (INHGL) module to constrain the ANP and learn invariant graph representation on non-homophilous graphs. Extensive experimental results on real-world non-homophilous graphs show that INPL could achieve state-of-the-art performance for learning on large non-homophilous graphs.

<title>A Spectral Framework for Evaluating Geodesic Distances Between Graphs</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a spectral framework for quantifying the differentiation between graph data samples by introducing a novel metric named Graph Geodesic Distance (GGD). For two different graphs with the same number of nodes, our framework leverages a spectral graph matching procedure to find node correspondence so that the geodesic distance between them can be subsequently computed by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem associated with their Laplacian matrices. For graphs of different sizes, a resistance-based spectral graph coarsening scheme is introduced to reduce the size of the larger graph while preserving the original spectral properties. We show that the proposed GGD metric can effectively quantify dissimilarities between two graphs by encapsulating their differences in key structural (spectral) properties, such as effective resistances between nodes, cuts, and the mixing time of random walks. Through extensive experiments comparing with state-of-the-art metrics, such as the latest Tree-Mover's Distance (TMD), the proposed GGD metric demonstrates significantly improved performance for graph classification, particularly when only partial node features are available. Furthermore, we extend the application of GGD beyond graph classification to stability analysis of GNNs and the quantification of distances between datasets, highlighting its versatility in broader machine learning contexts.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have seen great success in scientific domains thanks to spline activation functions, becoming an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, spline functions may not respect symmetry in tasks, which is crucial prior knowledge in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Equivariant Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (EKAN), a method for incorporating arbitrary matrix group equivariance into KANs, aiming to broaden their applicability to more fields. We first construct gated spline basis functions, which form the EKAN layer together with equivariant linear weights, and then define a lift layer to align the input space of EKAN with the feature space of the dataset, thereby building the entire EKAN architecture. Compared with baseline models, EKAN achieves higher accuracy with smaller datasets or fewer parameters on symmetry-related tasks, such as particle scattering and the three-body problem, often reducing test MSE by several orders of magnitude. Even in non-symbolic formula scenarios, such as top quark tagging with three jet constituents, EKAN achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art equivariant architectures using fewer than 40% of the parameters, while KANs do not outperform MLPs as expected. Code and data are available at https://github.com/hulx2002/EKAN .

Abstract: Recent methods aim to merge neural networks (NNs) with identical architectures trained on different tasks into a single multi-task model. While most works focus on the simpler setup of merging NNs initialized from a common pre-trained network, we target the harder problem of merging large transformers trained on different tasks from distinct initializations. We show that traditional merging methods fail catastrophically in this setup, while Knowledge Distillation (KD) achieves much better results, though at a higher cost. However, KD is data-inefficient, as it does not exploit the original models' weights. To solve this, we introduce "Foldable SuperNet Merge" (FS-Merge), which trains a SuperNet containing the original models (with frozen weights) using a feature reconstruction objective. After training, the SuperNet is folded back to the size of a single original model. FS-Merge is simple, data-efficient, has a computational cost comparable to KD, and is proven to have superior expressiveness compared to traditional merging methods on MLP models. It achieves SOTA results when tested on MLPs and transformers across various sizes, tasks, modalities, and distribution shifts, especially in low-data scenarios.

<title>Perfect Counterfactuals in Imperfect Worlds: Modelling Noisy Implementation of Actions in Sequential Algorithmic Recourse</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse suggests actions to individuals who have been adversely affected by automated decision-making, helping them to achieve the desired outcome. Knowing the recourse, however, does not guarantee that users can implement it perfectly, either due to environmental variability or personal choices. Recourse generation should thus anticipate its sub-optimal or noisy implementation. While several approaches construct recourse that is robust to small perturbations -- e.g., arising due to its noisy implementation -- they assume that the entire recourse is implemented in a single step, thus model the noise as one-off and uniform. But these assumptions are unrealistic since recourse often entails multiple sequential steps, which makes it harder to implement and subject to increasing noise. In this work, we consider recourse under plausible noise that adheres to the local data geometry and accumulates at every step of the way. We frame this problem as a Markov Decision Process and demonstrate that such a distribution of plausible noise satisfies the Markov property. We then propose the RObust SEquential (ROSE) recourse generator for tabular data; our method produces a series of steps leading to the desired outcome even when they are implemented imperfectly. Given plausible modelling of sub-optimal human actions and greater recourse robustness to accumulated uncertainty, ROSE provides users with a high chance of success while maintaining low recourse cost. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm effectively navigates the inherent trade-off between recourse robustness and cost while ensuring its sparsity and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Conventional model compression techniques for LLMs address high memory consumption and slow inference challenges but typically require computationally expensive retraining to preserve accuracy. In contrast, one-shot compression methods eliminate retraining cost, but struggle to achieve accuracy comparable to dense models. This paper presents SLIM, a new one-shot compression framework that holistically integrates hardware-friendly quantization, sparsity, and low-rank approximation into a unified process. First, we formulate the quantization process using a probabilistic approach (SLIM-Quant) that enables us to apply uniform quantization. Then, we use an existing one-shot pruning method to apply semi-structured sparsity on top of the quantized weights. Finally, to compensate for the introduced aggregated quantization and sparsity error, we use a novel saliency function with unique invertible and additive features that enables us to mathematically compute the value of low-rank adapters. SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4 sparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods. Models compressed with SLIM achieve up to 4.3x and 3.8x on Nvidia RTX3060 and A100 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, they achieve up to 0.23x end-to-end memory reduction in comparison to their dense counterparts. We also propose an optional PEFT recipe that further improves accuracy by up to 1.66% (LLaMA-2-13B) compared to SLIM without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Data augmentation that introduces diversity into the input data has long been used in training deep learning models. It has demonstrated benefits in improving robustness and generalization, practically aligning well with other regularization strategies such as dropout and weight decay. However, the underlying mechanism of how diverse training data contributes to model improvements remains unknown. In this paper, we investigate the impact of data diversity on the weight space of deep neural networks using Random Matrix Theory. Through spectral analysis and comparing models trained with data augmentation, dropout, and weight decay, we reveal that increasing data diversity alters the weight spectral distribution similarly to other regularization techniques, while displaying a pattern more closely aligned with dropout than with weight decay. Building on these insights, we propose a metric to explain and compare the benefits of diversity introduced by traditional data augmentations and those achieved through synthetic data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can solve diverse tasks but often exhibit unsafe behavior. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.

Abstract: Estimating the frequency of items on the high-volume, fast data stream has been extensively studied in many areas, such as database and network measurement. Traditional sketches provide only coarse estimates under strict memory constraints. Although some learning-augmented methods have emerged recently, they typically rely on offline training with real frequencies or/and labels, which are often unavailable. Moreover, these methods suffer from slow update speeds, limiting their suitability for real-time processing despite offering only marginal accuracy improvements. To overcome these challenges, we propose UCL-sketch, a practical learning-based paradigm for per-key frequency estimation. Our design introduces two key innovations: (i) an online training mechanism based on equivalent learning that requires no ground truth (GT), and (ii) a highly scalable architecture leveraging logically structured estimation buckets to scale to real-world data stream. The UCL-sketch, which utilizes compressive sensing (CS), converges to an estimator that provably yields a error bound far lower than that of prior works, without sacrificing the speed of processing. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed approaches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution. Notably, under extremely tight memory budgets, its quality almost matches that of an (infeasible) omniscient oracle. Moreover, compared to the existing equation-based sketch, UCL-sketch achieves an average decoding speedup of nearly 500 times. To help further research and development, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/UCL-sketch.

Abstract: In the peer review process of top-tier machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) conferences, reviewers are assigned to papers through automated methods. These assignment algorithms consider two main factors: (1) reviewers' expressed interests indicated by their bids for papers, and (2) reviewers' domain expertise inferred from the similarity between the text of their previously published papers and the submitted manuscripts. A significant challenge these conferences face is the existence of collusion rings, where groups of researchers manipulate the assignment process to review each other's papers, providing positive evaluations regardless of their actual quality. Most efforts to combat collusion rings have focused on preventing bid manipulation, under the assumption that the text similarity component is secure. In this paper, we demonstrate that even in the absence of bidding, colluding reviewers and authors can exploit the machine learning based text-matching component of reviewer assignment used at top ML/AI venues to get assigned their target paper. We also highlight specific vulnerabilities within this system and offer suggestions to enhance its robustness.

Abstract: Many important scientific problems involve multivariate optimization coupled with slow and laborious experimental measurements. These complex, high-dimensional searches can be defined by non-convex optimization landscapes that resemble needle-in-a-haystack surfaces, leading to entrapment in local minima. Contextualizing optimizers with human domain knowledge is a powerful approach to guide searches to localized fruitful regions. However, this approach is susceptible to human confirmation bias and it is also challenging for domain experts to keep track of the rapidly expanding scientific literature. Here, we propose the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for contextualizing Bayesian optimization (BO) via a hybrid optimization framework that intelligently and economically blends stochastic inference with domain knowledge-based insights from the LLM, which is used to suggest new, better-performing areas of the search space for exploration. Our method fosters user engagement by offering real-time commentary on the optimization progress, explaining the reasoning behind the search strategies. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic benchmarks with up to 15 independent variables and demonstrate the ability of LLMs to reason in four real-world experimental tasks where context-aware suggestions boost optimization performance substantially.

Abstract: Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) helps derive cellular mechanistic understanding, particularly in the context of complex conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in predicting protein structures and interactions via automated mining of vast biomedical literature; yet their inherent uncertainty remains a key challenge for deriving reproducible findings, critical for biomedical applications. In this study, we present an uncertainty-aware adaptation of LLMs for PPI analysis, leveraging fine-tuned LLaMA-3 and BioMedGPT models. To enhance prediction reliability, we integrate LoRA ensembles and Bayesian LoRA models for uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring confidence-calibrated insights into protein behavior. Our approach achieves competitive performance in PPI identification across diverse disease contexts while addressing model uncertainty, thereby enhancing trustworthiness and reproducibility in computational biology. These findings underscore the potential of uncertainty-aware LLM adaptation for advancing precision medicine and biomedical research.

However, practical DMs, such as stable diffusion, are typically trained on massive datasets and thus usually require large storage. At the same time, many steps may be required, i.e., recursively evaluating the trained neural network, to generate a high-quality image, which results in significant computational costs during sample generation. As a result, distillation methods on pre-trained DM have become widely adopted practices to develop smaller, more efficient models capable of rapid, few-step generation in low-resource environment. When these distillation methods are developed from different perspectives, there is an urgent need for a systematic survey, particularly from a methodological perspective. In this survey, we review distillation methods through three aspects: output loss distillation, trajectory distillation and adversarial distillation. We also discuss current challenges and outline future research directions in the conclusion.

Abstract: We develop an analytical framework for understanding how the generated distribution evolves during diffusion model training. Leveraging a Gaussian-equivalence principle, we solve the full-batch gradient-flow dynamics of linear and convolutional denoisers and integrate the resulting probability-flow ODE, yielding analytic expressions for the generated distribution. The theory exposes a universal inverse-variance spectral law: the time for an eigen- or Fourier mode to match its target variance scales as $\tau\propto\lambda^{-1}$, so high-variance (coarse) structure is mastered orders of magnitude sooner than low-variance (fine) detail. Extending the analysis to deep linear networks and circulant full-width convolutions shows that weight sharing merely multiplies learning rates accelerating but not eliminating the bias whereas local convolution introduces a qualitatively different bias. Experiments on Gaussian and natural-image datasets confirm the spectral law persists in deep MLP-based UNet. Convolutional U-Nets, however, display rapid near-simultaneous emergence of many modes, implicating local convolution in reshaping learning dynamics. These results underscore how data covariance governs the order and speed with which diffusion models learn, and they call for deeper investigation of the unique inductive biases introduced by local convolution.

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in data-driven applications, reducing input dimensionality to enhance learning accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Existing state-of-the-art methods often require post-selection retraining and extensive hyperparameter tuning, complicating their adoption. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive feature selection layer that, given a target feature count $k$, automatically identifies and selects the $k$ most informative features during neural network training. Our method is uniquely simple, requiring no alterations to the loss function, network architecture, or post-selection retraining. The layer is mathematically elegant and can be fully described by: \begin{align} \nonumber \tilde{x}_i = a_i x_i + (1-a_i)z_i \end{align} where $x_i$ is the input feature, $\tilde{x}_i$ the output, $z_i$ a Gaussian noise, and $a_i$ trainable gain such that $\sum_i{a_i^2}=k$. This formulation induces an automatic clustering effect, driving $k$ of the $a_i$ gains to $1$ (selecting informative features) and the rest to $0$ (discarding redundant ones) via weighted noise distortion and gain normalization. Despite its extreme simplicity, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets and a novel real-world dataset, outperforming or matching existing approaches without requiring hyperparameter search for $k$ or retraining. Theoretical analysis in the context of linear regression further validates its efficacy. Our work demonstrates that simplicity and performance are not mutually exclusive, offering a powerful yet straightforward tool for feature selection in machine learning.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend standard VAEs by replacing the fully factorised Gaussian prior with a GP prior, thereby capturing richer correlations among latent variables. However, performing exact GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of modality collapse, a recently observed empirical phenomenon wherein models trained for multimodal fusion tend to rely only on a subset of the modalities, ignoring the rest. We show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder, denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation, with applications in dealing with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks validate our theoretical claims. Project page: https://abhrac.github.io/mmcollapse/.

Abstract: In constrained Markov decision processes, enforcing constraints during training is often thought of as decreasing the final return. Recently, it was shown that constraints can be incorporated directly into the policy geometry, yielding an optimization trajectory close to the central path of a barrier method, which does not compromise final return. Building on this idea, we introduce Central Path Proximal Policy Optimization (C3PO), a simple modification of the PPO loss that produces policy iterates, that stay close to the central path of the constrained optimization problem. Compared to existing on-policy methods, C3PO delivers improved performance with tighter constraint enforcement, suggesting that central path-guided updates offer a promising direction for constrained policy optimization.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) by utilizing a networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss function $\huaL_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$ can encompass a broad spectrum of robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel-based learning schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish a learning theory and offer comprehensive convergence analysis for the algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence convergence bounds for the local approximating sequence in terms of the mean square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover, we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors) in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing robustness and ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Abstract: Real-world time series are often governed by complex nonlinear dynamics. Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting accuracy. Our code is available at: https://abrarmajeedi.github.io/deep_edm.

<title>Chasing Moving Targets with Online Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Safer Language Models</title>

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive, disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.

Abstract: Learning an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down generative model offers an expressive and interpretable framework for text and image generation. However, it remains unclear how this interpretability can be used to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training time. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents challenges in efficiency and sampling multimodal latent distributions. In this work, we propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for generative modeling and introduce the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model (T-KAM) to take advantage of structural and inductive biases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, T-KAM enables fast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. With the low dimensionality of the latent space and suitable inductive biases encoded, we demonstrate that importance sampling becomes a viable, unbiased, and highly efficient training strategy. We also introduce a training criterion using population-based LMC, which decomposes posterior sampling into a sequence of annealed distributions to improve multimodal exploration. T-KAM elegantly balances common trade-offs in generative modeling, offering fast inference, high sample quality, and stable training, while being naturally suited to upcoming Zettascale Computing Co. hardware and extendable to other high-impact research directions in generative intelligence.

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically assigned to generated scenes so that the degree of overlap between input and output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability of the resulting level scenes. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

Abstract: Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However, evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize.

Abstract: In ReLU networks, gradients of output units can be seen as their input-level representations, as they correspond to the units' pullbacks through the active subnetwork. However, gradients of deeper models are notoriously misaligned, significantly contributing to their black-box nature. We claim that this is because active subnetworks are inherently noisy due to the ReLU hard-gating. To tackle that noise, we propose soft-gating in the backward pass only. The resulting input-level vector field (called ''excitation pullback'') exhibits remarkable perceptual alignment, revealing high-resolution input- and target-specific features that ''just make sense'', therefore establishing a compelling novel explanation method. Furthermore, we speculate that excitation pullbacks approximate (directionally) the gradients of a simpler model, linear in the network's path space, learned implicitly during optimization and largely determining the network's decision; thus arguing for the faithfulness of the produced explanations and their overall significance.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.

Abstract: We introduce Sophisticated Learning (SL), a planning-to-learn algorithm that embeds active parameter learning inside the Sophisticated Inference (SI) tree-search framework of Active Inference. Unlike SI -- which optimizes beliefs about hidden states -- SL also updates beliefs about model parameters within each simulated branch, enabling counterfactual reasoning about how future observations would improve subsequent planning.
  We compared SL with Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning (BARL) agents as well as with its parent algorithm, SI. Using a biologically inspired seasonal foraging task in which resources shift probabilistically over a 10x10 grid, we designed experiments that forced agents to balance probabilistic reward harvesting against information gathering.
  In early trials, where rapid learning is vital, SL agents survive, on average, 8.2% longer than SI and 35% longer than Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning. While both SL and SI showed equal convergence performance, SL reached this convergence 40% faster than SI. Additionally, SL showed robust out-performance of other algorithms in altered environment configurations.
  Our results show that incorporating active learning into multi-step planning materially improves decision making under radical uncertainty, and reinforces the broader utility of Active Inference for modeling biologically relevant behavior.

Abstract: Current deep learning-based approaches to lesion segmentation in neuroimaging often depend on high-resolution images and extensive annotated data, limiting clinical applicability. This paper introduces a novel synthetic data framework tailored for stroke lesion segmentation, expanding the SynthSeg methodology to incorporate lesion-specific augmentations that simulate diverse pathological features. Using a modified nnUNet architecture, our approach trains models with label maps from healthy and stroke datasets, facilitating segmentation across both normal and pathological tissue without reliance on specific sequence-based training. Evaluation across in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) datasets reveals that our method matches state-of-the-art performance within the training domain and significantly outperforms existing methods on OOD data. By minimizing dependence on large annotated datasets and allowing for cross-sequence applicability, our framework holds potential to improve clinical neuroimaging workflows, particularly in stroke pathology.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider approximating the parameter-to-solution maps of parametric partial differential equations (PPDEs) using deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose an efficient approach combining reduced collocation methods (RCMs) and DNNs. In the approximation analysis section, we rigorously derive sharp upper bounds on the complexity of the neural networks. These bounds only depend on the reduced basis dimension rather than the high-fidelity discretization dimension, thereby theoretically guaranteeing the computational efficiency of our approach. In numerical experiments, we implement the RCM using radial basis function finite differences (RBF-FD) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and propose the POD-DNN algorithm. We consider various types of PPDEs and compare the accuracy and efficiency of different solvers. The POD-DNN has demonstrated significantly accelerated inference speeds compared with conventional numerical methods owing to the offline-online computation strategy. Furthermore, by employing the reduced basis methods (RBMs), it also outperforms standard DNNs in computational efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference methods that feature correct conditional coverage of confidence sets based on observations that have been compressed to a scalar test statistic require accurate modeling of either the p-value function or the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the test statistic. If the model of the cdf, which is typically a deep neural network, is a function of the test statistic then the derivative of the neural network with respect to the test statistic furnishes an approximation of the sampling distribution of the test statistic. We explore whether this approach to modeling conditional 1-dimensional sampling distributions is a viable alternative to the probability density-ratio method, also known as the likelihood-ratio trick. Relatively simple, yet effective, neural network models are used whose predictive uncertainty is quantified through a variety of methods.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of brain tumors in intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) images could facilitate localization of tumor tissue during resection surgery. The lack of large annotated datasets limits the current models performances. In this paper, we investigated the use of tumor annotations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are more accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated MRI scans with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training the nnU-Net model with different configurations of the data and label origins. The results showed no significant difference in Dice score for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors compared to models trained with only iUS annotations and both, and to expert annotations, indicating that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for iUS tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in iUS images. The best model obtained an average Dice score of $0.62\pm0.31$, compared to $0.67\pm0.25$ for an expert neurosurgeon, where the performance on larger tumors were similar, but lower for the models on smaller tumors. In addition, the results showed that removing smaller tumors from the training sets improved the results. The main models are available here: https://github.com/mathildefaanes/us_brain_tumor_segmentation/tree/main

<title>Beyond algorithm hyperparameters: on preprocessing hyperparameters and associated pitfalls in machine learning applications</title>

Abstract: Adequately generating and evaluating prediction models based on supervised machine learning (ML) is often challenging, especially for less experienced users in applied research areas. Special attention is required in settings where the model generation process involves hyperparameter tuning, i.e. data-driven optimization of different types of hyperparameters to improve the predictive performance of the resulting model. Discussions about tuning typically focus on the hyperparameters of the ML algorithm (e.g., the minimum number of observations in each terminal node for a tree-based algorithm). In this context, it is often neglected that hyperparameters also exist for the preprocessing steps that are applied to the data before it is provided to the algorithm (e.g., how to handle missing feature values in the data). As a consequence, users experimenting with different preprocessing options to improve model performance may be unaware that this constitutes a form of hyperparameter tuning, albeit informal and unsystematic, and thus may fail to report or account for this optimization. To illuminate this issue, this paper reviews and empirically illustrates different procedures for generating and evaluating prediction models, explicitly addressing the different ways algorithm and preprocessing hyperparameters are typically handled by applied ML users. By highlighting potential pitfalls, especially those that may lead to exaggerated performance claims, this review aims to further improve the quality of predictive modeling in ML applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in statistical learning theory have revealed profound connections between mutual information (MI) bounds, PAC-Bayesian theory, and Bayesian nonparametrics. This work introduces a novel mutual information bound for statistical models. The derived bound has wide-ranging applications in statistical inference. It yields improved contraction rates for fractional posteriors in Bayesian nonparametrics. It can also be used to study a wide range of estimation methods, such as variational inference or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). By bridging these diverse areas, this work advances our understanding of the fundamental limits of statistical inference and the role of information in learning from data. We hope that these results will not only clarify connections between statistical inference and information theory but also help to develop a new toolbox to study a wide range of estimators.

<title>GDSR: Global-Detail Integration through Dual-Branch Network with Wavelet Losses for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution</title>

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose the Dual-Group Multi-Scale Wavelet Loss, a wavelet-domain constraint mechanism via dual-group subband strategy and cross-resolution frequency alignment for enhanced reconstruction fidelity in RSI-SR. Extensive experiments under two degradation methods on several benchmarks, including AID, UCMerced, and RSSRD-QH, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.09 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 3.2 times faster.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) enables valid statistical inference by combining experimental data with machine learning predictions. When a sufficient number of high-quality predictions is available, PPI results in more accurate estimates and tighter confidence intervals than traditional methods. In this paper, we propose to inform the PPI framework with prior knowledge on the quality of the predictions. The resulting method, which we call frequentist, assisted by Bayes, PPI (FAB-PPI), improves over PPI when the observed prediction quality is likely under the prior, while maintaining its frequentist guarantees. Furthermore, when using heavy-tailed priors, FAB-PPI adaptively reverts to standard PPI in low prior probability regions. We demonstrate the benefits of FAB-PPI in real and synthetic examples.

Abstract: Reliable detection of speech deepfakes (spoofs) must remain effective when the distribution of spoofing attacks shifts. We frame the task as domain generalization and show that inserting Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters into every attention head of a self-supervised (SSL) backbone, then training only those adapters with Meta-Learning Domain Generalization (MLDG), yields strong zero-shot performance. The resulting model updates about 3.6 million parameters, roughly 1.1% of the 318 million updated in full fine-tuning, yet surpasses a fully fine-tuned counterpart on five of six evaluation corpora. A first-order MLDG loop encourages the adapters to focus on cues that persist across attack types, lowering the average EER from 8.84% for the fully fine-tuned model to 5.30% with our best MLDG-LoRA configuration. Our findings show that combining meta-learning with parameter-efficient adaptation offers an effective method for zero-shot, distribution-shift-aware speech deepfake detection.

<title>Cognitive Behaviors that Enable Self-Improving Reasoners, or, Four Habits of Highly Effective STaRs</title>

Abstract: Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language models to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau.

Abstract: This paper deals with the identification of linear stochastic dynamical systems, where the unknowns include system coefficients and noise variances. Conventional approaches that rely on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) require nontrivial gradient computations and are prone to local optima. To overcome these limitations, a sample-efficient global optimization method based on Bayesian optimization (BO) is proposed, using an ensemble Gaussian process (EGP) surrogate with weighted kernels from a predefined dictionary. This ensemble enables a richer function space and improves robustness over single-kernel BO. Each objective evaluation is efficiently performed via Kalman filter recursion. Extensive experiments across parameter settings and sampling intervals show that the EGP-based BO consistently outperforms MLE via steady-state filtering and expectation-maximization (whose derivation is a side contribution) in terms of RMSE and statistical consistency. Unlike the ensemble variant, single-kernel BO does not always yield such gains, underscoring the benefits of model averaging. Notably, the BO-based estimator achieves RMSE below the classical Cramer-Rao bound, particularly for the inverse time constant, long considered difficult to estimate. This counterintuitive outcome is attributed to a data-driven prior implicitly induced by the GP surrogate in BO.

<title>Incorporating Coupling Knowledge into Echo State Networks for Learning Spatiotemporally Chaotic Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Machine learning methods have shown promise in learning chaotic dynamical systems, enabling model-free short-term prediction and attractor reconstruction. However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic systems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from inefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive amount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this challenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system as an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate that leveraging coupling knowledge into ESN models can enhance their robustness to variations of training and target system conditions. We further show that our proposed model remains effective even when the coupling knowledge is imperfect or extracted directly from time series data. We believe this approach has the potential to enhance other machine-learning methods.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new privacy challenges, particularly during inference where sensitive information in prompts may be exposed to proprietary LLM APIs. In this paper, we address the problem of formally protecting the sensitive information contained in a prompt while maintaining response quality. To this end, first, we introduce a cryptographically inspired notion of a prompt sanitizer which transforms an input prompt to protect its sensitive tokens. Second, we propose Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt, a novel system that implements a prompt sanitizer. Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt categorizes sensitive tokens into two types: (1) those where the LLM's response depends solely on the format (such as SSNs, credit card numbers), for which we use format-preserving encryption (FPE); and (2) those where the response depends on specific values, (such as age, salary) for which we apply metric differential privacy (mDP). Our evaluation demonstrates that Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt is a practical method to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees, while maintaining high utility compared to unsanitized prompts, and outperforming prior methods

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.

Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.

Summary: This study introduces a novel graph-based framework that combines neural networks and symbolic analysis to explore mathematical relationships in physics equations. By starting with a large set of equations and focusing on advanced physics topics, the framework successfully identifies cross-domain connections and validates established theories. The system serves a dual purpose of generating hypotheses and auditing knowledge, producing hundreds of potential connections between different physics domains. Through symbolic analysis, the framework verifies theory consistencies, synthesizes new concepts, and highlights potential research areas. The intentional over-generation of candidates ensures thorough exploration of mathematical possibilities, even identifying errors that can be used for redundancy identification and knowledge base assessment. Overall, the framework transforms complex combinatorial spaces into manageable streams of mathematical patterns for further analysis. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The vast corpus of physics equations forms an implicit network of mathematical relationships that traditional analysis cannot fully explore. This work introduces a graph-based framework combining neural networks with symbolic analysis to systematically discover and validate mathematical patterns across physics domains. Starting from 659 equations, we performed rigorous semantic disambiguation to resolve notational polysemy affecting 213 equations, then focused on 400 advanced physics equations by excluding elementary mechanics to emphasize inter-branch connections of modern physics. This corpus was represented as a weighted knowledge graph where a Graph Attention Network achieved 97.4% AUC in link prediction, significantly outperforming classical baselines. The framework's primary value emerges from its dual capability: generating hypotheses and auditing knowledge. First, it functions as a hypothesis generator, producing hundreds of candidate cross-domain connections, from blackbody radiation coupled with Navier-Stokes equations to radioactive decay linked with electromagnetic induction. Second, through symbolic analysis of 30 equation clusters, it serves as a computational auditor that verified established theory consistencies, synthesized the Magnetic Reynolds Number from electromagnetic-fluid coupling, and revealed how even parsing errors could potentially point toward legitimate research like analog gravity. This proof-of-concept intentionally over-generates candidates to ensure comprehensive exploration of mathematical possibility space. Even tautologies and errors serve scientific purposes: redundancy identification and knowledge base quality assessment. The system transforms the intractable combinatorial space into a filtered stream of mathematical patterns for human interpretation.

Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning the current state with a target semantic instruction using a Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT). Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models (LLMs) and fluid control applications.

Summary: 
The article introduces LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a plugin designed to improve sample efficiency in preference-based optimization frameworks. LoRR allows for training at a high replay number, maximizing the usefulness of collected data batches. To combat overfitting, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy that preserves network plasticity by reusing initial data. Additionally, LoRR uses a hybrid optimization objective combining supervised fine-tuning and preference-based losses to enhance data exploitation. Experimental results show that LoRR significantly enhances the performance of preference optimization methods on math and general reasoning benchmarks. A DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on math tasks, surpassing some complex RL-based algorithms. This demonstrates LoRR's practicality, sample efficiency, and effectiveness in improving LLM performance with limited data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective, combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical, sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking greater performance from limited data.

<div> Keywords: anomaly detection, SQL, database systems, machine learning, DistilBERT

Summary:
This paper presents a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for SQL using the DistilBERT model, combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. The unsupervised method identifies out-of-scope queries by flagging embedding vectors distant from normal user behavior patterns, while the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision through role-labeled classification. The approach minimizes the need for data labeling and effectively safeguards critical database systems from both internal and external threats. By leveraging DistilBERT's efficiency and pre-trained capabilities, this method accurately identifies anomalous activities that may resemble normal behavior, thereby addressing the limitations of existing detection methods in capturing abnormal database access behaviors. Overall, this approach provides a robust solution for combating sophisticated attacks on database systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.

Abstract: Blockchain-enabled federated learning (BCFL) addresses fundamental challenges of trust, privacy, and coordination in collaborative AI systems. This chapter provides comprehensive architectural analysis of BCFL systems through a systematic four-dimensional taxonomy examining coordination structures, consensus mechanisms, storage architectures, and trust models. We analyze design patterns from blockchain-verified centralized coordination to fully decentralized peer-to-peer networks, evaluating trade-offs in scalability, security, and performance. Through detailed examination of consensus mechanisms designed for federated learning contexts, including Proof of Quality and Proof of Federated Learning, we demonstrate how computational work can be repurposed from arbitrary cryptographic puzzles to productive machine learning tasks. The chapter addresses critical storage challenges by examining multi-tier architectures that balance blockchain's transaction constraints with neural networks' large parameter requirements while maintaining cryptographic integrity. A technical case study of the TrustMesh framework illustrates practical implementation considerations in BCFL systems through distributed image classification training, demonstrating effective collaborative learning across IoT devices with highly non-IID data distributions while maintaining complete transparency and fault tolerance. Analysis of real-world deployments across healthcare consortiums, financial services, and IoT security applications validates the practical viability of BCFL systems, achieving performance comparable to centralized approaches while providing enhanced security guarantees and enabling new models of trustless collaborative intelligence.

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across $200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Summary: 
- The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a reinforcement learning algorithm in personalizing physical activity nudges through a Fitbit app in a large-scale randomized controlled trial.
- Participants were randomized into control, random, fixed, and reinforcement learning arms, with the reinforcement learning group showing a significant increase in daily step count compared to all other groups at 1 and 2 months.
- The reinforcement learning group sustained a significant increase in daily steps compared to the control group at 2 months.
- Generalized estimating equation models also supported the sustained increase in daily steps in the reinforcement learning group compared to the control group.
- The findings highlight the potential of using a scalable, behaviorally-informed reinforcement learning approach to personalize digital health interventions for promoting physical activity.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control, random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female, baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296 steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps, p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs. control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health interventions for PA.

<div> Keywords: time series forecasting, stability, accuracy, deep learning models, ensemble models 

Summary: 
The study focuses on the importance of forecast stability in time series forecasting for supply chain demand planning. While accuracy is crucial, consistency and stability are valued by demand planners in production systems. Model-induced stochasticity, which measures the variance of forecasts produced by a single model with fixed inputs, is key to determining stability. The research evaluates the stability and accuracy of various state-of-the-art forecasting models on public datasets. Results show that ensemble models enhance stability without compromising forecast accuracy, and in some cases even improving it. The paper emphasizes the need for further research on forecast stability in models deployed in production systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements. Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST, Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising, the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars. We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly, our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains practical.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

arXiv:2508.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability over existing VLMs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function. While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy for deep neural networks aimed at capturing complex temporal patterns in time series data. The proposed method uses rotational equiangular tight frame-classifiers and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with limited labeled samples. In addition, generative pretext tasks are integrated into the method to effectively capture temporal dynamics and enforce embedding separability. A novel sequential augmentation strategy is defined to enhance the pre-training process. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied to various types of neural network models on multivariate time series classification datasets. These findings underscore the importance of aligning pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns, to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method that leverages counterfactual explanations to calculate the distance to decision boundaries, enabling accurate and interpretable OOD detection. By computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space, the method improves scalability for large architectures. The use of counterfactual explanations allows for seamless interpretation of the detector results. On CIFAR-10, the method achieves 93.50% AUROC and 25.80% FPR95, outperforming existing methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05% AUROC and 13.79% FPR95, as well as on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95 across four OOD datasets. <div>

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively. In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space. Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and 25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05% AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95 across four OOD datasets

<div> population level, linear convergence, regression parameters, Euclidean distance, finite-sample level

Summary:
The paper focuses on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm's behavior in overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) models with unknown parameters. The study investigates the convergence rates and accuracy levels in population and finite-sample scenarios. Theoretical results show linear convergence of regression parameters with unbalanced initial mixing weights and sublinear convergence with balanced mixing weights. Statistical accuracies are demonstrated to be dependent on the balance of mixing weights, with different rates for unbalanced and balanced cases. The connection between population and finite-sample results is highlighted, leading to intuitive iteration complexity bounds. The analysis is further extended to the low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regime, providing insights into the behavior of the EM algorithm in the presence of model misspecification. <div>

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown $d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the $\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$ given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$ for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and $O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Summary: 
The evaluation of reasoning language models has become crucial as they demonstrate the ability to combine existing capabilities into new ways of problem-solving. The study emphasizes that superior performance is not solely due to algorithmic enhancements or model size but also the use of impactful benchmarks as learning curricula. This approach, known as benchmark-driven selection of AI, highlights the significance of challenging benchmarks in enhancing the generalization capabilities of reasoning models. By steering the development of AI through impactful benchmarks, the evaluation process is transformed into a learning experience, where the novelty of test tasks plays a key role in measuring the model's ability to generalize. Ultimately, benchmarks are viewed as essential curricula for model training rather than merely unseen test sets. <div>

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models. Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data, including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency, Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models for sustainable livestock management.

Summary: 
An AI-driven pipeline has been developed to extract and analyze handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, providing a cost-effective and scalable source of forensic evidence for disrupting the transnational ivory trade. By analyzing 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory, over 17,000 individual markings were extracted and labeled using AI tools. 184 recurring "signature markings" were identified, with 20 of them connecting multiple seizures and establishing forensic links between traffickers involved in both shipments. This innovative approach complements traditional investigative techniques and fills gaps in data where genetic evidence is unavailable or costly. The study showcases the potential of AI in wildlife forensics and offers practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts aimed at combating organized wildlife crime.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings" that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

<br />
Summary: The study assesses the quality of sampling from RBMs using a local-valley (LV) centered approach on the D-Wave quantum annealer. Comparisons were made between samples obtained from D-Wave and Gibbs sampling, focusing on the number of LVs and energy of local minima. Results showed no significant increase in the number of LVs with decreased D-Wave annealing time. While D-Wave samples covered a slightly higher number of LVs compared to Gibbs, there was limited overlap in identified LVs between the two methods. Additionally, important local minima with intermediate probability values were only found by one sampling technique. The overlap between D-Wave and Gibbs decreased at later training epochs, suggesting a potential for improved sampling quality at this stage. The findings suggest the potential for enhancement through a combined classical-quantum approach. <div>
arXiv:2508.10228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch, the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

<div> Key: cirrhosis, acute kidney injury, machine learning, prediction, intensive care unit <br />
Summary: <br />
- The study developed a machine learning model for early prediction of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients with cirrhosis using clinical variables. <br />
- Data from 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis were analyzed, and LightGBM algorithm achieved the best performance with an AUROC of 0.808. <br />
- Key predictors identified for AKI risk included prolonged partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH, and altered pO2. <br />
- The model's high negative predictive value (0.911) allows safe de-escalation for low-risk patients and supports targeted prevention strategies. <br />
- The results suggest actionable targets for early intervention and highlight the importance of accurate risk stratification for AKI in cirrhotic patients in ICU settings. <br />  <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database, identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC, accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI 0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH, and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables. Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention. External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are warranted.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors introduce a novel application of in-context learning (ICL) for cryptographic function learning, specifically focusing on mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere ciphers. These ciphers involve a hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text characters. The goal is for the model to infer the substitution given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs and decode a new cipher text word. This structured inference challenge allows for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of transformers under the ICL paradigm. The study demonstrates the ability of transformer-based language models to learn and generalize over complex cryptographic functions purely from context, without performing any parameter updates. The code for this project is freely available on GitHub for further exploration and experimentation.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of transformers under the ICL paradigm.

<div> backdoor attack, transformer, HPMI, pruning, injection<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces HPMI, a novel retraining-free backdoor attack method for transformers. HPMI does not require altering the model's architecture and only needs a small subset of original data and basic knowledge of the model architecture. By pruning the least important head and injecting a pre-trained malicious head, HPMI establishes a backdoor that is resistant to detection and removal by current defense techniques. Experimental evaluations show that HPMI maintains high attack success rates while incurring minimal clean accuracy loss, and it successfully bypasses advanced defense mechanisms. Compared to retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI demonstrates greater concealment and robustness against different defense strategies. <div>
arXiv:2508.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer. Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean accuracy.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud computing environments.

Summary:
This paper introduces a new method for source component shift adaptation in data streams. Existing online learning approaches struggle to effectively utilize recurring shifts and model-pool-based methods have difficulty capturing individual source components. The proposed method combines offline decomposition and online mixing to address these challenges. By first decomposing source components offline using the EM algorithm and then adapting mixing weights online through convex optimization, the method achieves superior adaptation performance compared to existing approaches. Experimental results on real-world regression datasets show a significant reduction in cumulative test loss of up to 67.4%. The method's theoretical foundation allows it to leverage shift characteristics effectively and outperform baseline methods. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

<br />Summary: <br /> 
The article introduces a new approach to Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management using a conformal prediction framework to anticipate medication needs up to two years in advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Current approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive methods, leading to inadequate symptom control or side effects.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from 631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving life quality.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces SynBrain, a generative framework that models the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain utilizes BrainVAE for probabilistic learning of neural representations and a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper for projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold for fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding and efficient adaptation to new subjects with limited data. SynBrain also captures functional consistency across trials and subjects, revealing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The synthesized fMRI signals enhance data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. The code for SynBrain will be publicly available. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will be made publicly available.

Summary: 
The article introduces Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework for leveraging past knowledge to generate informed initializations for learning new tasks in healthcare settings using federated learning. FedKEI starts with global clustering to generalize knowledge across tasks and optimizes aggregation weights across and within clusters to personalize knowledge transfer for new tasks. A bi-level optimization scheme is used to collaboratively learn global intra-cluster weights and optimize local inter-cluster weights. Experiments on dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT datasets show that FedKEI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adapting to new diseases. <div>

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities, including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning often assume homogeneous client data distributions or require a clean server dataset, limiting their practicality. The CLIP-Fed framework proposes a novel defense approach that utilizes vision-language pre-training models to tackle backdoor attacks in the presence of heterogeneous client data distributions. By incorporating both pre- and post-aggregation defense strategies, CLIP-Fed mitigates the limitations posed by Non-IID data. It constructs and augments the server dataset using multimodal language models and frequency analysis, without client samples, to address privacy concerns and enhance dataset coverage against diverse triggers. CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence to address class prototype deviations and eliminate trigger-label correlations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with reduced Attack Success Rate (ASR) and improved Model Accuracy (MA) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-LT datasets. <div>

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies, CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness. To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

Summary: 
Fair clustering traditionally focused on equitable representation or equal clustering costs, but recent research suggests these notions may lead to suboptimal results. A welfare-centric approach, considering group utilities based on distances and representation, offers a new perspective. Two optimization objectives, Rawlsian and Utilitarian, are proposed to address this. Novel algorithms are introduced with theoretical guarantees. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing fair clustering methods. This work highlights the importance of considering group welfare in clustering algorithms for more equitable and efficient outcomes.

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However, Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing fair clustering baselines.

Summary: 
The article discusses the vulnerabilities of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to cyberattacks and the limitations of traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Due to the heterogeneous and resource-constrained nature of IoMT devices, running IDSs locally is often infeasible, and delays in updating models leave devices exposed to zero-day attacks. To address these challenges, the proposed multi-level IoMT IDS framework utilizes a near-Edge layer for coarse traffic filtering using meta-learning or One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm, followed by far Edge and Cloud layers for identifying attack types and novelty. Experimental results on the CICIoMT2024 dataset demonstrate high accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The meta-learning approach achieves strong performance, making it suitable for real-world IoMT environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained, heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables), making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024 dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets, ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the meta-learning approach achieves high.

Summary: 
This paper examines distribution learning in semantic communication, where receivers must infer underlying meaning distributions from sequential observations. The research establishes conditions for learning source statistics when priors are unknown. It shows that the full rank of the effective transmission matrix is essential for learnability and provides insights into the convergence rate of distribution estimation. The analysis also highlights a trade-off between encoding schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance and long-term learnability. Experimental validation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates the impact of system conditioning on learning rate and performance. The results offer valuable design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with adaptation capability. <div>

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication. This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework, demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with adaptation capability.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$ fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and 2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area, 9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

It addresses the lack of evaluation frameworks in assessing ITL methods' ability to capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations. To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation framework.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces XQuant, a new algorithm that reduces memory consumption in large language models (LLMs) through low-bit quantization. By quantizing and caching layer input activations instead of using standard KV caching, XQuant achieves a 2x memory savings compared to traditional methods. XQuant also leverages the similarity of X values across layers to introduce XQuant-CL, which further compresses memory usage. XQuant-CL can achieve up to 10x memory savings with minimal perplexity degradation. By exploiting the increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms, XQuant surpasses state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and maintains near-FP16 accuracy across various models. The approach of trading increased computation for reduced memory operations in LLM inference proves to be highly effective and efficient. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly available.

Summary: 
The study investigates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in tensorized models and scale-invariant settings. SAM's regularization behavior is analyzed, revealing its control over core norm imbalances through covariance between core norms and gradient magnitudes. A new method, Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS), is proposed to mimic SAM's regularization by adaptively scaling core norms based on data. Experimental results across various tasks like tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning demonstrate that DAS outperforms SAM with less computational overhead. <div>
arXiv:2508.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes. Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method, \emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces RealAC, a domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations in AI decision-making. RealAC aligns joint distributions of feature pairs to preserve inter-feature dependencies without explicit domain knowledge. It allows users to freeze attributes they don't want to change and offers realistic and feasible explanations. Evaluations show RealAC outperforms existing methods in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and realism metrics. It provides a solution for causality-aware and user-centric counterfactual generation. <div>
arXiv:2508.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover, they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric counterfactual generation.

Summary:
X-Node is a novel self-explaining GNN framework that ensures interpretability in decision-making processes. Each node in the GNN generates its own explanation by encoding interpretable cues like degree and feature saliency within its local topology. A Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector that reconstructs the node's latent embedding, generates natural language explanations, and guides the GNN through a "text-injection" mechanism. X-Node maintains competitive accuracy in classification tasks while providing faithful, per-node explanations. The framework is evaluated on graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrated with popular GNN backbones like GCN, GAT, and GIN. The code repository is available on GitHub for further exploration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations. Repository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.

<div> GraphFedMIG, federated graph learning, generative adversarial network, statistical heterogeneity, class imbalance <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces GraphFedMIG, a novel framework for federated graph learning to address challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity and class imbalance. GraphFedMIG utilizes a hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local generator to synthesize feature representations. Clients are grouped into clusters with dedicated discriminators, and a mutual information-guided mechanism is employed to correct generator parameters and focus on producing high-value, minority-class features. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate GraphFedMIG's superior performance compared to other baselines. <div>
arXiv:2508.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private, decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information, hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators. By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value, minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

<div> calibration-free BCIs, continual model adaptation, personalized decoder, neural signal drift, accuracy improvement <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces EDAPT, a novel framework for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that eliminates the need for frequent recalibration by continually adapting the model during use. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple users and then personalizes this model through supervised finetuning as neural patterns evolve over time. The framework was tested across nine datasets for three BCI tasks and consistently outperformed conventional static methods, with improvements attributed to population-level pretraining and online finetuning. Additionally, unsupervised domain adaptation provided further gains in some datasets. Importantly, EDAPT updates models efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, with decoding accuracy scaling with data budget rather than its allocation between subjects and trials. Overall, EDAPT offers a practical solution for calibration-free BCIs, addressing a key barrier to wider deployment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Summary:
Unobserved confounding, a common issue in observational studies, also affects recommender systems when observed features are ignored. Practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing, and modularization can introduce confounding and reduce system performance. This paper demonstrates through simulation studies how these practices can lead to biased causal effect estimates in recommendation systems. It provides practical suggestions for practitioners to minimize or eliminate the effects of confounding in real-world systems, emphasizing the importance of considering unmeasured features that may influence both the treatment and outcome. By highlighting the vulnerability of recommender systems to unobserved confounding, this paper urges practitioners to be cautious in their design and implementation to ensure accurate and reliable recommendations.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine, ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

Summary: 
This study introduces a spectral framework to analyze and quantify the smoothness and faithfulness of explanations produced by ReLU networks. It addresses the noisy and difficult to interpret nature of vanilla gradient-based explanations by examining the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness. The research identifies and regularizes the contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, offering a principled approach to balancing these factors. The analysis reveals how surrogate-based smoothing techniques can distort explanations, leading to an "explanation gap" that is measured across various post-hoc methods. By validating the theoretical findings across different scenarios and datasets, the study provides valuable insights into improving the interpretability of explanations generated by ReLU networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions, sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods, such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an ``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design choices, datasets, and ablations.

Traditional ECOC methods require manual or random codebook design, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial attacks compared to two baselines.

Summary:
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System) is a modular framework that integrates multimodal understanding and generation through two distinct phases: Cognition and Deliberation. In the Cognition phase, three role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents collaborate to perform structured understanding and planning. The Deliberation phase includes a Growth-Aware Search mechanism that combines reasoning and generation in a mutually reinforcing way. MAGUS supports extensibility, any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment without joint training. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art systems, including surpassing the closed-source model GPT-4o on the MME benchmark. <div>
arXiv:2508.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities, enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text, image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases: Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector - engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility, scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

<div> Keywords: combinatorial optimization, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo, deep reinforcement learning, 4-SAT benchmarks

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing complex cost functions in combinatorial optimization problems using traditional MCMC algorithms. Conventional MCMC approaches struggle near computational phase transitions due to the overlap-gap property, resulting in difficulties unfreezing rigid variables and escaping suboptimal solutions. To overcome these challenges, Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms with inhomogeneous temperature profiles were introduced. This study utilizes deep reinforcement learning to train nonlocal transition policies for NMC, leveraging energy changes and landscape geometry as rewards and states, respectively. The trained policies outperform standard MCMC and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy, time-to-solution, and solution diversity. Overall, the integration of deep RL into NMC algorithms enhances performance in tackling challenging combinatorial optimization problems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy, time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Summary:
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD) is introduced as a test-time framework that allows for constrained joint generation from multiple pre-trained diffusion models. PCD incorporates a coupled guidance term into the generative dynamics to promote coordination between diffusion models and includes a projection step at each diffusion step to enforce specific constraints. The proposed method is demonstrated to be effective in scenarios such as image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning. Results indicate improved coupling effects and guarantee constraint satisfaction without excessive computational costs. PCD addresses the challenge of generating jointly correlated samples from multiple diffusion models while enforcing task-specific constraints, providing a promising solution for various application scenarios. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model. However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning. Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

arXiv:2508.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses, represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM, originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets to facilitate future research.

Summary:
The article addresses the challenge of reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning tasks, particularly in the context of software engineering. Existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to define meaningful immediate rewards without bias or task decomposition. The proposed SWE-oriented RL Framework supports multi-turn interaction and customizable reward functions. Additionally, the Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA) method accumulates immediate rewards only when high-level rewards meet a predefined threshold, leading to stable RL optimization. Experimental results on SWE-bench Verified and kBench show significant improvements in completion rates and modification rates, without suffering from reward misalignment issues. The study emphasizes the importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL tasks and provides a practical solution through G-RA.

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction, docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates (47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a practical solution.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy. While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

<div> Graph Representation, Model Unification, Generalizability, Domain-Fracture, Deep Learning

Summary:
Unified learning is proposed to address the challenge of maintaining generalizability in medical imaging deep learning models under domain-fracture scenarios. This paradigm encodes individual models into a graph representation, enabling unification in a shared graph learning space.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability, remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts.

<title>Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer</title>

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.

<title>FreeGAD: A Training-Free yet Effective Approach for Graph Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically, it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii) an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a collaborative learning approach that improves privacy by keeping data on the client-side while sharing only the intermediate output with a server. However, the distributed nature of SL introduces new security challenges, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of potential attacks. This paper systematically reviews various attacks on SL, classifying them based on factors such as the attacker's role, the type of privacy risks, when data leaks occur, and where vulnerabilities exist. We also analyze existing defense methods, including cryptographic methods, data modification approaches, distributed techniques, and hybrid solutions. Our findings reveal security gaps, highlighting the effectiveness and limitations of existing defenses. By identifying open challenges and future directions, this work provides valuable information to improve SL privacy issues and guide further research.

<title>Variance Reduced Policy Gradient Method for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10608</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward. This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL, policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces. In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

<title>Beyond Random Sampling: Instance Quality-Based Data Partitioning via Item Response Theory</title>

arXiv:2508.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

<title>Energy-Based Models for Predicting Mutational Effects on Proteins</title>

arXiv:2508.10629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between $\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate $\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states, allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new $\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization against SARS-CoV-2.

<title>Conditional Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Fusion: Overcoming Shortcut Learning in Sarcasm Detection</title>

arXiv:2508.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut learning.

<title>SPHENIC: Topology-Informed Multi-View Clustering for Spatial Transcriptomics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

<title>Geospatial Diffusion for Land Cover Imperviousness Change Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq 0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns from historical data that are significant for projecting future change. Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of different scenarios by means of driver variables.

We investigate a comprehensive class of Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal logic formulas from graph datasets.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural $\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the proposed framework.

<title>REFN: A Reinforcement-Learning-From-Network Framework against 1-day/n-day Exploitations</title>

arXiv:2508.10701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching (average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations. REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways (Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that translates language context (vulnerability description) into network enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22 families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1 percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of 3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n day exploitations.

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs. Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations. Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the simulations is sufficiently fine.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL, we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial. Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model (i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover, Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a potential future direction.

This work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention (NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data, implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design. Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to 64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus 3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation error.

<title>Enhancing Fairness in Autoencoders for Node-Level Graph Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed, GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection. To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose \textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tlhey/decaf_code.

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\; algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty. However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior. The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets, including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP algorithm.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration. This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles, including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation), memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing, forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning (ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML). At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners, complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

<title>Efficiently Verifiable Proofs of Data Attribution</title>

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like "what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce \ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e. SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM, CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average. Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly as effective. We release our dataset at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}, and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards. Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations, generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health outcomes.

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility. We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an effective defence.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of enzyme kinetics literature has outpaced the curation capabilities of major biochemical databases, creating a substantial barrier to AI-driven modeling and knowledge discovery. We present zERExtractor, an automated and extensible platform for comprehensive extraction of enzyme-catalyzed reaction and activity data from scientific literature. zERExtractor features a unified, modular architecture that supports plug-and-play integration of state-of-the-art models, including large language models (LLMs), as interchangeable components, enabling continuous system evolution alongside advances in AI. Our pipeline combines domain-adapted deep learning, advanced OCR, semantic entity recognition, and prompt-driven LLM modules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters (e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions, and molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active learning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and iterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also release a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and 5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications. Benchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing baselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up to 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the longstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready framework and high-fidelity extraction, laying the groundwork for future AI-powered enzyme modeling and biochemical knowledge discovery.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events, or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation detection. The code and data have been released.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving classification models using LLMs.

<title>User Perception of Attention Visualizations: Effects on Interpretability Across Evidence-Based Medical Documents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture. Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features (e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However, there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how they are visually presented.

To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies, however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data, resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare data.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations. Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature. Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and intervention.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable, token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning (LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4% and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH benchmark.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability, and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines. By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised language generation systems.

Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.

<title>Neural Network-Based Detection and Multi-Class Classification of FDI Attacks in Smart Grid Home Energy Systems</title>

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns, which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms, thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution for enhancing grid resilience at the edge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty (inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained, dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and reliable structured generation systems.

<title>Bayesian Models for Joint Selection of Features and Auto-Regressive Lags: Theory and Applications in Environmental and Financial Forecasting</title>

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables. Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&amp;P 500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods, our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive settings.

<title>Dynamical Alignment: A Principle for Adaptive Neural Computation</title>

Abstract: The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be determined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by establishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally different computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal dynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.
  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By encoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a bimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by phase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting dynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In contrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the representational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their artificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.
  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment between input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn, offers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in neuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration dynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial systems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing toward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex static architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation principles.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Cancer is recognized as a complex group of diseases, contributing to the highest global mortality rates, with increasing prevalence and a trend toward affecting younger populations. It is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough, indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents. Network pharmacology analysis successfully identified key bioactive compounds Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data augmentation, highlighting its accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for xanthone based compounds. Additionally, molecular docking revealed MTOR as a potential target for inducing cytotoxicity in HeLa cancer cells from Garcinia cowa.

Abstract: Cloud detection is essential for atmospheric retrievals, climate studies, and weather forecasting. We analyze infrared radiances from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites to classify scenes as clear or cloudy.
  We apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, based on kernel methods for non-separable data. In this study, the method is implemented for Cloud Identification (CISVM) to classify the test set using radiances or brightness temperatures, with dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and cloud-sensitive channel selection to focus on the most informative features. Our best configuration achieves 88.30 percent agreement with reference labels and shows strong consistency with cloud masks from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with the largest discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.
  These results demonstrate that CISVM is a robust, flexible, and efficient method for automated cloud classification from infrared radiances, suitable for operational retrievals and future missions such as Far infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM), the ninth European Space Agency Earth Explorer Mission.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms. This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

Abstract: Neural decoding of pathological and physiological states can enable patient-individualized closed-loop neuromodulation therapy. Recent advances in pre-trained large-scale foundation models offer the potential for generalized state estimation without patient-individual training. Here we present a foundation model trained on chronic longitudinal deep brain stimulation recordings spanning over 24 days. Adhering to long time-scale symptom fluctuations, we highlight the extended context window of 30 minutes. We present an optimized pre-training loss function for neural electrophysiological data that corrects for the frequency bias of common masked auto-encoder loss functions due to the 1-over-f power law. We show in a downstream task the decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation without patient-individual training.

Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but available in situ, or satellite data for carbon pools in the shelf sea environment are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an ensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES) sea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis outputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN ensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could complement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly uncertain.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ) dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8 categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation, (ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and (iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low resource settings.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual, nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors, {confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score, $\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors. These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous, confident confabulation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm. And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making for a more efficient unlearning process.

Abstract: Traditional models for pricing catastrophe (CAT) bonds struggle to capture the complex, relational data inherent in these instruments. This paper introduces CATNet, a novel framework that applies a geometric deep learning architecture, the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN), to model the CAT bond primary market as a graph, leveraging its underlying network structure for spread prediction. Our analysis reveals that the CAT bond market exhibits the characteristics of a scale-free network, a structure dominated by a few highly connected and influential hubs. CATNet demonstrates high predictive performance, significantly outperforming a strong Random Forest benchmark. The inclusion of topological centrality measures as features provides a further, significant boost in accuracy. Interpretability analysis confirms that these network features are not mere statistical artifacts; they are quantitative proxies for long-held industry intuition regarding issuer reputation, underwriter influence, and peril concentration. This research provides evidence that network connectivity is a key determinant of price, offering a new paradigm for risk assessment and proving that graph-based models can deliver both state-of-the-art accuracy and deeper, quantifiable market insights.

As an example, we apply this result to the class of binary memoryless sources. Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional Sibson's mutual information.

Abstract: Children's speech presents challenges for age and gender classification due to high variability in pitch, articulation, and developmental traits. While self-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their ability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper presents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture speaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly focus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification, reducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR. These results reveal how speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth and support more targeted, adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1, our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning, resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of the integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning in our training pipeline.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+ benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method, showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and +1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models is critical for superior performance on personalized downstream tasks, compared to using pre-trained models. Collaborative learning can leverage local clients' datasets for fine-tuning, but limited client data and heterogeneous data distributions hinder effective collaboration. To address the challenge, we propose a flexible personalized federated learning paradigm that enables clients to engage in collaborative learning while maintaining personalized objectives. Given the limited and heterogeneous computational resources available on clients, we introduce \textbf{flexible personalized split federated learning (FlexP-SFL)}. Based on split learning, FlexP-SFL allows each client to train a portion of the model locally while offloading the rest to a server, according to resource constraints. Additionally, we propose an alignment strategy to improve personalized model performance on global data. Experimental results show that FlexP-SFL outperforms baseline models in personalized fine-tuning efficiency and final accuracy.

Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate (CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature importances for each of the objectives.

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However, real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions, largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes. To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper, we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math 2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an `Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ), objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK) scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone. Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans (DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with 2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection, classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the built environment.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift. Our methodology leverages a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer Base (ViT-B/14) backbone with multiple classification heads for species, genus, and family prediction, utilizing taxonomic hierarchies. Key contributions include multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through bagging and Hydra model architectures. The approach incorporates various inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts, top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies. Experiments were conducted on approximately 1.4 million training images covering 7,806 plant species. Results demonstrate strong performance, making our submission 3rd best on the private leaderboard. Our code is available at https://github.com/geranium12/plant-clef-2025/tree/v1.0.0.

Abstract: Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks, yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by a significant margin.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i) black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step, safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs, pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems.

Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC), research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence. Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters, thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for complex inverse scattering problems.

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot interaction systems.

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats, yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates, and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents. While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise, actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts. Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR, alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive cybersecurity frameworks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory, processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target classification is possible.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN) v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics, M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation -- operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from 5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\% reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085. The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD, which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing, where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers. Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent. A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

Much research is available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to mitigate their flaws.

<title>Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

<title>Parity Cross-Resonance: A Multiqubit Gate</title>

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples, we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers. This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Plant diseases are a major threat to food security globally. It is important to develop early detection systems which can accurately detect. The advancement in computer vision techniques has the potential to solve this challenge. We have developed a mobile-friendly solution which can accurately classify 101 plant diseases across 33 crops. We built a comprehensive dataset by combining different datasets, Plant Doc, PlantVillage, and PlantWild, all of which are for the same purpose. We evaluated performance across several lightweight architectures - MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, MobileNetV3-Large, and EfficientNet-B0, B1 - specifically chosen for their efficiency on resource-constrained devices. The results were promising, with EfficientNet-B1 delivering our best performance at 94.7% classification accuracy. This architecture struck an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-world deployment on mobile devices.

<title>Accelerating exoplanet climate modelling: A machine learning approach to complement 3D GCM grid simulations</title>

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters. A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network (DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b, HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference. The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large, computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks. To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization (MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP) frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a 3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage, their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to biomolecular simulations.

<title>CrossDenoise: Denoising Implicit Feedback via a Lightweight Entity-Aware Synergistic Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10851</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling, suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy (DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector ($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n = \tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on the performance of Echo State Network.

Abstract: A widely used algorithm for transfer learning is fine-tuning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a target task with a small amount of labeled data. When the capacity of the pre-trained model is significantly larger than the size of the target dataset, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and memorizing the training labels. Hence, a crucial question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness against noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling -- the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self-label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of image and text datasets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task. When the target data set includes noisy labels, our approach outperforms baseline methods by an average of 3.56% in two noisy settings.

Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling in multi-class, parallel-server queuing systems with uncertain rewards from job-server assignments. In this scenario, jobs incur holding costs while awaiting completion, and job-server assignments yield observable stochastic rewards with unknown mean values. The mean rewards for job-server assignments are assumed to follow a bilinear model with respect to features that characterize jobs and servers. Our objective is to minimize regret by maximizing the cumulative reward of job-server assignments over a time horizon, while keeping the total job holding cost bounded to ensure the stability of the queueing system. This problem is motivated by applications requiring resource allocation in network systems. In this problem, it is essential to control the tradeoff between reward maximization and fair allocation for the stability of the underlying queuing system (i.e., maximizing network throughput). To address this problem, we propose a scheduling algorithm based on a weighted proportional fair criteria augmented with marginal costs for reward maximization, incorporating a bandit algorithm tailored for bilinear rewards. Our algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound and a sub-linear mean holding cost (and queue length bound) of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, respectively, with respect to the time horizon $T$, thus guaranteeing queuing system stability. Additionally, we establish stability conditions for distributed iterative algorithms for computing allocations, which are relevant to large-scale system applications. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm through numerical experiments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning excels at learning representations from large amounts of data. At the same time, generative models offer the complementary property of learning information about the underlying data generation process. In this study, we aim at establishing a principled connection between these two paradigms and highlight the benefits of their complementarity. In particular, we perform an analysis of self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis suggests a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a lower bound proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes and unlocking full unification. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating that our objective function allows to jointly train a backbone network in a discriminative and generative fashion, consequently outperforming existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that the solution can be integrated into a neuro-symbolic framework to tackle a simple yet non-trivial instantiation of the symbol grounding problem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/emsansone/GEDI.

Abstract: Phishing email is a serious cyber threat that tries to deceive users by sending false emails with the intention of stealing confidential information or causing financial harm. Attackers, often posing as trustworthy entities, exploit technological advancements and sophistication to make detection and prevention of phishing more challenging. Despite extensive academic research, phishing detection remains an ongoing and formidable challenge in the cybersecurity landscape. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Masked Language Models (MLMs) possess immense potential to offer innovative solutions to address long-standing challenges. In this research paper, we present an optimized, fine-tuned transformer-based DistilBERT model designed for the detection of phishing emails. In the detection process, we work with a phishing email dataset and utilize the preprocessing techniques to clean and solve the imbalance class issues. Through our experiments, we found that our model effectively achieves high accuracy, demonstrating its capability to perform well. Finally, we demonstrate our fine-tuned model using Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Transformer Interpret to explain how our model makes predictions in the context of text classification for phishing emails.

Abstract: Methods with adaptive stepsizes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, are essential for training modern Deep Learning models, especially Large Language Models. Typically, the noise in the stochastic gradients is heavy-tailed for the later ones. Gradient clipping provably helps to achieve good high-probability convergence for such noises. However, despite the similarity between AdaGrad/Adam and Clip-SGD, the current understanding of the high-probability convergence of AdaGrad/Adam-type methods is limited in this case. In this work, we prove that AdaGrad/Adam (and their delayed version) can have provably bad high-probability convergence if the noise is heavy-tailed. We also show that gradient clipping fixes this issue, i.e., we derive new high-probability convergence bounds with polylogarithmic dependence on the confidence level for AdaGrad-Norm and Adam-Norm with clipping and with/without delay for smooth convex/non-convex stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed noise. We extend our results to the case of AdaGrad/Adam with delayed stepsizes. Our empirical evaluations highlight the superiority of clipped versions of AdaGrad/Adam in handling the heavy-tailed noise.

Abstract: We study contextual dynamic pricing, where a decision maker posts personalized prices based on observable contexts and receives binary purchase feedback indicating whether the customer's valuation exceeds the price. Each valuation is modeled as an unknown latent function of the context, corrupted by independent and identically distributed market noise from an unknown distribution. Relying only on Lipschitz continuity of the noise distribution and bounded valuations, we propose a minimax-optimal algorithm. To accommodate the unknown distribution, our method discretizes the relevant noise range to form a finite set of candidate prices, then applies layered data partitioning to obtain confidence bounds substantially tighter than those derived via the elliptical-potential lemma. A key advantage is that estimation bias in the valuation function cancels when comparing upper confidence bounds, eliminating the need to know the Lipschitz constant. The framework extends beyond linear models to general function classes through offline regression oracles. Our regret analysis depends solely on the oracle's estimation error, typically governed by the statistical complexity of the class. These techniques yield a regret upper bound matching the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we refine these guarantees under additional structures -- e.g., linear valuation models, second-order smoothness, sparsity, and known noise distribution or observable valuations -- and compare our bounds and assumptions with prior dynamic-pricing methods. Finally, numerical experiments corroborate the theory and show clear improvements over benchmark methods.

Abstract: The performance of the standard Online Robust Principal Component Analysis (OR-PCA) technique depends on the optimum tuning of the explicit regularizers and this tuning is dataset sensitive. We aim to remove the dependency on these tuning parameters by using implicit regularization. We propose to use the implicit regularization effect of various modified gradient descents to make OR-PCA tuning free. Our method incorporates three different versions of modified gradient descent that separately but naturally encourage sparsity and low-rank structures in the data. The proposed method performs comparable or better than the tuned OR-PCA for both simulated and real-world datasets. Tuning-free ORPCA makes it more scalable for large datasets since we do not require dataset-dependent parameter tuning.

Given i.i.d.~data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL network accurately answers, with error probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown promise in various applications (e.g. robot locomotion) but is often limited to learning a single expert policy, constraining behavior diversity and robustness in unpredictable real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce Quality Diversity Inverse Reinforcement Learning (QD-IRL), a novel framework that integrates quality-diversity optimization with IRL methods, enabling agents to learn diverse behaviors from limited demonstrations. This work introduces Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity (EBC), which allows agents to receive additional curiosity rewards from an external critic based on how novel the behaviors are with respect to a large behavioral archive. To validate the effectiveness of EBC in exploring diverse locomotion behaviors, we evaluate our method on multiple robot locomotion tasks. EBC improves the performance of QD-IRL instances with GAIL, VAIL, and DiffAIL across all included environments by up to 185%, 42%, and 150%, even surpassing expert performance by 20% in Humanoid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBC is applicable to Gradient-Arborescence-based Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) algorithms, where it substantially improves performance and provides a generic technique for learning behavioral-diverse policies.

Abstract: Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful representation learning tool for graph-structured data. However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/dhsiuu/DiRW.

Abstract: Spatial-temporal graph representations play a crucial role in urban sensing applications, including traffic analysis, human mobility behavior modeling, and citywide crime prediction. However, a key challenge lies in the noisy and sparse nature of spatial-temporal data, which limits existing neural networks' ability to learn meaningful region representations in the spatial-temporal graph. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGAurban, a novel heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph masked autoencoder that leverages generative self-supervised learning for robust urban data representation. Our framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph encoder that extracts region-wise dependencies from multi-source data, enabling comprehensive modeling of diverse spatial relationships. Within our self-supervised learning paradigm, we implement a masked autoencoder that jointly processes node features and graph structure. This approach automatically learns heterogeneous spatial-temporal patterns across regions, significantly improving the representation of dynamic temporal correlations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal mining tasks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and robustly handles real-world urban data challenges, including noise and sparsity in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

<title>Multi-objective Optimization in CPU Design Space Exploration: Attention is All You Need</title>

Abstract: Design Space Exploration (DSE) is essential to modern CPU design, yet current frameworks struggle to scale and generalize in high-dimensional architectural spaces. As the dimensionality of design spaces continues to grow, existing DSE frameworks face three fundamental challenges: (1) reduced accuracy and poor scalability of surrogate models in large design spaces; (2) inefficient acquisition guided by hand-crafted heuristics or exhaustive search; (3) limited interpretability, making it hard to pinpoint architectural bottlenecks.
  In this work, we present \textbf{AttentionDSE}, the first end-to-end DSE framework that \emph{natively integrates} performance prediction and design guidance through an attention-based neural architecture. Unlike traditional DSE workflows that separate surrogate modeling from acquisition and rely heavily on hand-crafted heuristics, AttentionDSE establishes a unified, learning-driven optimization loop, in which attention weights serve a dual role: enabling accurate performance estimation and simultaneously exposing the performance bottleneck. This paradigm shift elevates attention from a passive representation mechanism to an active, interpretable driver of design decision-making.
  Key innovations include: (1) a \textbf{Perception-Driven Attention} mechanism that exploits architectural hierarchy and locality, scaling attention complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ via sliding windows; (2) an \textbf{Attention-aware Bottleneck Analysis} that automatically surfaces critical parameters for targeted optimization, eliminating the need for domain-specific heuristics.
  Evaluated on high-dimensional CPU design space using the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite, AttentionDSE achieves up to \textbf{3.9\% higher Pareto Hypervolume} and over \textbf{80\% reduction in exploration time} compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.

Abstract: With the increase in the number of parameters in large language models, the process of pre-training and fine-tuning increasingly demands larger volumes of GPU memory. A significant portion of this memory is typically consumed by the optimizer state. To overcome this challenge, recent approaches such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)), low-rank gradient projection (GaLore (Zhao et al., 2024)), and blockwise optimization (BAdam (Luo et al., 2024)) have been proposed. However, in all these algorithms, the $\textit{effective rank of the weight updates remains low-rank}$, which can lead to a substantial loss of information from the gradient. This loss can be critically important, especially during the pre-training stage. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{FRUGAL}$ ($\textbf{F}$ull-$\textbf{R}$ank $\textbf{U}$pdates with $\textbf{G}$r$\textbf{A}$dient sp$\textbf{L}$itting), a new memory-efficient optimization framework. $\texttt{FRUGAL}$ leverages gradient splitting to perform low-dimensional updates using advanced algorithms (such as Adam), while updates along the remaining directions are executed via state-free methods like SGD or signSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018). Our framework can be integrated with various low-rank update selection techniques, including GaLore and BAdam. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our framework when using SGDM for low-dimensional updates and SGD for state-free updates. Additionally, our method consistently outperforms concurrent approaches across various fixed memory budgets, achieving state-of-the-art results in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks while balancing memory efficiency and performance metrics.

Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a highly efficient approach for downstream tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, applying LoRA techniques to quantized LLMs poses unique challenges due to the reduced representational precision of quantized weights. In this paper, we introduce CLoQ (Calibrated LoRA initialization for Quantized LLMs), a simplistic initialization strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our approach focuses on minimizing the layer-wise discrepancy between the original LLM and its quantized counterpart with LoRA components during initialization. By leveraging a small calibration dataset, CLoQ quantizes a pre-trained LLM and determines the optimal LoRA components for each layer, ensuring a strong foundation for subsequent fine-tuning. A key contribution of this work is a novel theoretical result that enables the accurate and closed-form construction of these optimal LoRA components. We validate the efficacy of CLoQ across multiple tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing LoRA fine-tuning methods for quantized LLMs, especially at ultra low-bit widths.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

Abstract: In online advertising under the cost-per-conversion (CPA) model, accurate conversion rate (CVR) prediction is crucial. A major challenge is delayed feedback, where conversions may occur long after user interactions, leading to incomplete recent data and biased model training. Existing solutions partially mitigate this issue but often rely on auxiliary models, making them computationally inefficient and less adaptive to user interest shifts. We propose IF-DFM, an \underline{I}nfluence \underline{F}unction-empowered for \underline{D}elayed \underline{F}eedback \underline{M}odeling which estimates the impact of newly arrived and delayed conversions on model parameters, enabling efficient updates without full retraining. By reformulating the inverse Hessian-vector product as an optimization problem, IF-DFM achieves a favorable trade-off between scalability and effectiveness. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that IF-DFM outperforms prior methods in both accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Distributed optimization has become the default training paradigm in modern machine learning due to the growing scale of models and datasets. To mitigate communication overhead, local updates are often applied before global aggregation, resulting in a nested optimization approach with inner and outer steps. However, heavy-tailed stochastic gradient noise remains a significant challenge, particularly in attention-based models, hindering effective training. In this work, we propose TailOPT, an efficient framework designed to address heavy-tailed noise by leveraging adaptive optimization or clipping techniques. We establish convergence guarantees for the TailOPT framework under heavy-tailed noise with potentially unbounded gradient variance and local updates. Among its variants, we highlight a memory and communication efficient instantiation which we call $Bi^2Clip$, which performs coordinate-wise clipping at both the inner and outer optimizers, achieving adaptive-like performance (e.g., Adam) without the cost of maintaining or transmitting additional gradient statistics. Empirically, TailOPT, including $Bi^2Clip$, demonstrates superior performance on several language tasks and models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The brain rapidly adapts to new contexts and learns from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms struggle to mimic. Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.

Abstract: Machine learning models play a key role for service providers looking to gain market share in consumer markets. However, traditional learning approaches do not take into account the existence of additional providers, who compete with each other for consumers. Our work aims to study learning in this market setting, as it affects providers, consumers, and the market itself. We begin by analyzing such markets through the lens of the learning objective, and show that accuracy cannot be the only consideration. We then propose a method for classification under competition, so that a learner can maximize market share in the presence of competitors. We show that our approach benefits the providers as well as the consumers, and find that the timing of market entry and model updates can be crucial. We display the effectiveness of our approach across a range of domains, from simple distributions to noisy datasets, and show that the market as a whole remains stable by converging quickly to an equilibrium.

Abstract: When learning is used to inform decisions about humans, such as for loans, hiring, or admissions, this can incentivize users to strategically modify their features, at a cost, to obtain positive predictions. The common assumption is that the function governing costs is exogenous, fixed, and predetermined. We challenge this assumption, and assert that costs can emerge as a result of deploying a classifier. Our idea is simple: when users seek positive predictions, this creates demand for important features; and if features are available for purchase, then a market will form, and competition will give rise to prices. We extend the strategic classification framework to support this notion, and study learning in a setting where a classifier can induce a market for features. We present an analysis of the learning task, devise an algorithm for computing market prices, propose a differentiable learning framework, and conduct experiments to explore our novel setting and approach.

Abstract: Policies generated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are difficult to explain to users, as they emerge from the interaction of complex reward structures and neural network representations. Consequently, analyzing and predicting agent behavior can be challenging, undermining user trust in real-world applications. To facilitate user understanding, current methods for global policy summarization typically rely on videos that demonstrate agent behavior in a subset of world states. However, users can only watch a limited number of demonstrations, constraining their understanding. Moreover, these methods place the burden of interpretation on users by presenting raw behaviors rather than synthesizing them into coherent patterns. To resolve these issues, we introduce SySLLM (Synthesized Summary using Large Language Models), advocating for a new paradigm of abstractive-textual policy explanations. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)-which possess extensive world knowledge and pattern synthesis capabilities-SySLLM generates textual summaries that provide structured and comprehensible explanations of agent policies. SySLLM demonstrates that LLMs can interpret spatio-temporally structured descriptions of state-action trajectories from an RL agent and generate valuable policy insights in a zero-shot setting, without any prior knowledge or fine-tuning. Our evaluation shows that SySLLM captures key insights, such as goal preferences and exploration strategies, that were also identified by human experts. Furthermore, in a large-scale user study (with 200 participants), SySLLM summaries were preferred over demonstration-based summaries (HIGHLIGHTS) by a clear majority (75.5%) of participants.

Abstract: Popular PEFT methods reduce trainable parameter count for fine-tuning by parameterizing new low-rank or sparse trainable weights in parallel to the frozen pre-trained weights $W$. However, these weights are trained from scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$, comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results with 9$\boldsymbol\times$ fewer trainable parameters than the leading PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a function of parameter-efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is critical for safe and efficient autonomous driving, especially in mixed traffic environments when both human-driven and autonomous vehicles co-exist. However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/cpraskoti/MIAT.

Abstract: As a new distributed graph learning paradigm, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) facilitates collaborative model training across local systems while preserving data privacy.
  We review existing FGL approaches and categorize their optimization mechanisms into:
  (1) Server-Client (S-C), where clients upload local model parameters for server-side aggregation and global updates;
  (2) Client-Client (C-C), which allows direct exchange of information between clients and customizing their local training process.
  We reveal that C-C shows superior potential due to its refined communication structure.
  However, existing C-C methods broadcast redundant node representations, incurring high communication costs and privacy risks at the node level. To this end, we propose FedC4, which combines graph Condensation with C-C Collaboration optimization. Specifically, FedC4 employs graph condensation technique to refine the knowledge of each client's graph into a few synthetic embeddings instead of transmitting node-level knowledge. Moreover, FedC4 introduces three novel modules that allow the source client to send distinct node representations tailored to the target client's graph properties. Experiments on eight public real-world datasets show that FedC4 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both task performance and communication cost.

Abstract: Conventional time-series forecasting methods typically aim to minimize overall prediction error, without accounting for the varying importance of different forecast ranges in downstream applications. We propose a training methodology that enables forecasting models to adapt their focus to application-specific regions of interest at inference time, without retraining. The approach partitions the prediction space into fine-grained segments during training, which are dynamically reweighted and aggregated to emphasize the target range specified by the application. Unlike prior methods that predefine these ranges, our framework supports flexible, on-demand adjustments. Experiments on standard benchmarks and a newly collected wireless communication dataset demonstrate that our method not only improves forecast accuracy within regions of interest but also yields measurable gains in downstream task performance. These results highlight the potential for closer integration between predictive modeling and decision-making in real-world systems.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly operate in environments where devices must respond in real time while managing fluctuating resource constraints, including energy and bandwidth. Yet, current approaches often fall short in addressing scenarios where operational constraints evolve over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit framework tailored for IoT applications with dynamic operational limits. Our model introduces a decaying violation budget, which permits limited constraint violations early in the learning process and gradually enforces stricter compliance over time. We present the Budgeted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which adaptively balances performance optimization and compliance with time-varying constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that Budgeted UCB achieves sublinear regret and logarithmic constraint violations over the learning horizon. Extensive simulations in a wireless communication setting show that our approach achieves faster adaptation and better constraint satisfaction than standard online learning methods. These results highlight the framework's potential for building adaptive, resource-aware IoT systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face deployment challenges due to high computational costs, and while Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a solution, existing rotation-based methods struggle at very low bit-widths like 2-bit. We introduce a novel, training-free approach to construct an improved rotation matrix, addressing the limitations of current methods. The key contributions include leveraging the Walsh-Hadamard transform with sequency ordering, which clusters similar frequency components to reduce quantization error compared to standard Hadamard matrices, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a Grouped Sequency-arranged Rotation (GSR) using block-diagonal matrices with smaller Walsh blocks, effectively isolating outlier impacts and achieving performance comparable to optimization-based methods without requiring any training. Our method demonstrates robust performance on reasoning tasks and Perplexity (PPL) score on WikiText-2. Our method also enhances results even when applied over existing learned rotation techniques.

Abstract: In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around fairness, transparency and robustness, among others. As the complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.
  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML, their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing suggestions for future work.

Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution, when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model fitness and computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an interpretation of the codelengths. This allows the improvement of model fitness, while maintaining the succinctness of the codelengths, and the avoidance of the significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing promising performance enhancements on several datasets in comparison to most related methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

Abstract: We extend the standard reinforcement learning framework to random time horizons. While the classical setting typically assumes finite and deterministic or infinite runtimes of trajectories, we argue that multiple real-world applications naturally exhibit random (potentially trajectory-dependent) stopping times. Since those stopping times typically depend on the policy, their randomness has an effect on policy gradient formulas, which we (mostly for the first time) derive rigorously in this work both for stochastic and deterministic policies. We present two complementary perspectives, trajectory or state-space based, and establish connections to optimal control theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that using the proposed formulas can significantly improve optimization convergence compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods have been central to many of the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. The most common approach is to use symmetric architectures, whereby both actor and critic have the same network topology and number of parameters. However, recent works have argued for the advantages of asymmetric setups, specifically with the use of smaller actors. We perform broad empirical investigations and analyses to better understand the implications of this and find that, in general, smaller actors result in performance degradation and overfit critics. Our analyses suggest poor data collection, due to value underestimation, as one of the main causes for this behavior, and further highlight the crucial role the critic can play in alleviating this pathology. We explore techniques to mitigate the observed value underestimation, which enables further research in asymmetric actor-critic methods.

Abstract: As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent in both consumer and defense applications, the need for reliable, modality-specific classification systems grows in urgency. This paper addresses the challenge of data scarcity in UAV audio classification by expanding on prior work through the integration of pre-trained deep learning models, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies, and targeted data augmentation techniques. Using a custom dataset of 3,100 UAV audio clips (15,500 seconds) spanning 31 distinct drone types, we evaluate the performance of transformer-based and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures under various fine-tuning configurations. Experiments were conducted with five-fold cross-validation, assessing accuracy, training efficiency, and robustness. Results show that full fine-tuning of the EfficientNet-B0 model with three augmentations achieved the highest validation accuracy (95.95), outperforming both the custom CNN and transformer-based models like AST. These findings suggest that combining lightweight architectures with PEFT and well-chosen augmentations provides an effective strategy for UAV audio classification on limited datasets. Future work will extend this framework to multimodal UAV classification using visual and radar telemetry.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states. PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns. Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and evolving time series dynamics.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. A key development is the reformulation of the reverse sampling process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE), which allows for efficient sampling using high-order numerical solvers. Unlike traditional time integrator analysis, the accuracy of this sampling procedure depends not only on numerical integration errors but also on the approximation quality and regularity of the learned score function, as well as their interaction. In this work, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of deterministic samplers derived from probability flow ODEs for general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules. Specifically, we develop and analyze $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes, under the practical assumption that the first and second derivatives of the learned score function are bounded. We prove that the total variation distance between the generated and target distributions can be bounded as \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension, and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum solver step size. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets further confirm that the derivatives of the learned score function are bounded in practice.

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification, demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at https://github.com/zhengziyu77/DGMAE.

Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

Abstract: High-quality training data is essential for building reliable and efficient machine learning systems. One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning the dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often relying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most existing methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty, overlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes. In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such as network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often clusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and introduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a quantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with performance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to overrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones. To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple sampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and medical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a class-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows remarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and recall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best method, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and 4.11% in recall. We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy, imbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly modeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and generalizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: Denoiser models have become powerful tools for inverse problems, enabling the use of pretrained networks to approximate the score of a smoothed prior distribution. These models are often used in heuristic iterative schemes aimed at solving Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) optimisation problems, where the proximal operator of the negative log-prior plays a central role. In practice, this operator is intractable, and practitioners plug in a pretrained denoiser as a surrogate-despite the lack of general theoretical justification for this substitution. In this work, we show that a simple algorithm, closely related to several used in practice, provably converges to the proximal operator under a log-concavity assumption on the prior $p$. We show that this algorithm can be interpreted as a gradient descent on smoothed proximal objectives. Our analysis thus provides a theoretical foundation for a class of empirically successful but previously heuristic methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur individual and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop out of the decision process. To address this problem from different perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall, state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models, where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model), and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$, the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically, our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity $\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$ outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods rely heavily on photometric and geometric consistency constraints, but newer machine learning-based MVS methods check geometric consistency across multiple source views only as a post-processing step. In this paper, we present a novel approach that explicitly encourages geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views at different scales during learning (see Fig. 1). We find that adding this geometric consistency loss significantly accelerates learning by explicitly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, reducing the training iteration requirements to nearly half that of other MVS methods. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets, and competitive results on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, GC-MVSNet is the first attempt to enforce multi-view, multi-scale geometric consistency during learning.

Abstract: Finding the optimal solution is often the primary goal in combinatorial optimization (CO). However, real-world applications frequently require diverse solutions rather than a single optimum, particularly in two key scenarios. The first scenario occurs in real-world applications where strictly enforcing every constraint is neither necessary nor desirable. Allowing minor constraint violations can often lead to more cost-effective solutions. This is typically achieved by incorporating the constraints as penalty terms in the objective function, which requires careful tuning of penalty parameters. The second scenario involves cases where CO formulations tend to oversimplify complex real-world factors, such as domain knowledge, implicit trade-offs, or ethical considerations. To address these challenges, generating (i) penalty-diversified solutions by varying penalty intensities and (ii) variation-diversified solutions with distinct structural characteristics provides valuable insights, enabling practitioners to post-select the most suitable solution for their specific needs. However, efficiently discovering these diverse solutions is more challenging than finding a single optimal one. This study introduces Continual Parallel Relaxation Annealing (CPRA), a computationally efficient framework for unsupervised-learning (UL)-based CO solvers that generates diverse solutions within a single training run. CPRA leverages representation learning and parallelization to automatically discover shared representations, substantially accelerating the search for these diverse solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CPRA outperforms existing UL-based solvers in generating these diverse solutions while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothesis space for deep learning based on deep neural networks (DNNs). By treating a DNN as a function of two variables - the input variable and the parameter variable - we consider the set of DNNs where the parameter variable belongs to a space of weight matrices and biases determined by a prescribed depth and layer widths. To construct a Banach space of functions of the input variable, we take the weak* closure of the linear span of this DNN set. We prove that the resulting Banach space is a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS) and explicitly construct its reproducing kernel. Furthermore, we investigate two learning models - regularized learning and the minimum norm interpolation (MNI) problem - within the RKBS framework by establishing representer theorems. These theorems reveal that the solutions to these learning problems can be expressed as a finite sum of kernel expansions based on training data.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable performance in many continuous control tasks. However, a significant obstacle to the real-world application of DRL is the lack of safety guarantees. Although DRL agents can satisfy system safety in expectation through reward shaping, designing agents to consistently meet hard constraints (e.g., safety specifications) at every time step remains a formidable challenge. In contrast, existing work in the field of safe control provides guarantees on persistent satisfaction of hard safety constraints. However, these methods require explicit analytical system dynamics models to synthesize safe control, which are typically inaccessible in DRL settings. In this paper, we present a model-free safe control algorithm, the implicit safe set algorithm, for synthesizing safeguards for DRL agents that ensure provable safety throughout training. The proposed algorithm synthesizes a safety index (barrier certificate) and a subsequent safe control law solely by querying a black-box dynamic function (e.g., a digital twin simulator). Moreover, we theoretically prove that the implicit safe set algorithm guarantees finite time convergence to the safe set and forward invariance for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. We validate the proposed algorithm on the state-of-the-art Safety Gym benchmark, where it achieves zero safety violations while gaining $95\% \pm 9\%$ cumulative reward compared to state-of-the-art safe DRL methods. Furthermore, the resulting algorithm scales well to high-dimensional systems with parallel computing.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art methods for estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices all shrink the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix towards a data-insensitive shrinkage target. The underlying shrinkage transformation is either chosen heuristically - without compelling theoretical justification - or optimally in view of restrictive distributional assumptions. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to construct covariance estimators without imposing restrictive assumptions. That is, we study distributionally robust covariance estimation problems that minimize the worst-case Frobenius error with respect to all data distributions close to a nominal distribution, where the proximity of distributions is measured via a divergence on the space of covariance matrices. We identify mild conditions on this divergence under which the resulting minimizers represent shrinkage estimators. We show that the corresponding shrinkage transformations are intimately related to the geometrical properties of the underlying divergence. We also prove that our robust estimators are efficiently computable and asymptotically consistent and that they enjoy finite-sample performance guarantees. We exemplify our general methodology by synthesizing explicit estimators induced by the Kullback-Leibler, Fisher-Rao, and Wasserstein divergences. Numerical experiments based on synthetic and real data show that our robust estimators are competitive with state-of-the-art estimators.

Abstract: We study the role of contextual information in the online learning problem of brokerage between traders. In this sequential problem, at each time step, two traders arrive with secret valuations about an asset they wish to trade. The learner (a broker) suggests a trading (or brokerage) price based on contextual data about the asset and the market conditions. Then, the traders reveal their willingness to buy or sell based on whether their valuations are higher or lower than the brokerage price. A trade occurs if one of the two traders decides to buy and the other to sell, i.e., if the broker's proposed price falls between the smallest and the largest of their two valuations. We design algorithms for this problem and prove optimal theoretical regret guarantees under various standard assumptions.

Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts. This results in the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional moments. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package ondil.

<title>Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression in Interpolation Space by Over-Parameterized Neural Networks Trained with Preconditioned Gradient Descent and Early-Stopping</title>

arXiv:2407.11353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression using an over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with algorithmic guarantees in this paper. We consider the setting where the training features are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere in $\RR^d$, and the target function lies in an interpolation space commonly studied in statistical learning theory. We demonstrate that training the neural network with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, equipped with early stopping, achieves a sharp regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $\bth{\cH_K}^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3$. This rate is even sharper than the currently known nearly-optimal rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})\log^2(1/\delta)$, where $n$ is the size of the training data and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a small probability. This rate is also sharper than the standard kernel regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha+1}})$ obtained under the regular Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime when training the neural network with the vanilla gradient descent (GD), where $2\alpha = d/(d-1)$. Our analysis is based on two key technical contributions. First, we present a principled decomposition of the network output at each PGD step into a function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of a newly induced integral kernel, and a residual function with small $L^{\infty}$-norm. Second, leveraging this decomposition, we apply local Rademacher complexity theory to tightly control the complexity of the function class comprising all the neural network functions obtained in the PGD iterates. Our results further suggest that PGD enables the neural network to escape the linear NTK regime and achieve improved generalization, as it effectively induces a new kernel termed the integral kernel, compared to the regular NTK arising from the vanilla GD.

Abstract: In this work, we systematically expose and measure the inconsistency and knowledge gaps of Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose an automated testing framework (called KonTest) which leverages a knowledge graph to construct test cases. KonTest probes and measures the inconsistencies in the LLM's knowledge of the world via a combination of semantically-equivalent queries and test oracles (metamorphic or ontological oracle). KonTest further mitigates knowledge gaps via a weighted LLM model ensemble. Using four state-of-the-art LLMs (Falcon, Gemini, GPT3.5, and Llama2), we show that KonTest generates 19.2% error inducing inputs (1917 errors from 9979 test inputs). It also reveals a 16.5% knowledge gap across all tested LLMs. A mitigation method informed by KonTest's test suite reduces LLM knowledge gap by 32.48%. Our ablation study further shows that GPT3.5 is not suitable for knowledge-based consistency testing because it is only 60%-68% effective in knowledge construction.

<title>Collaborative Mean Estimation Among Heterogeneous Strategic Agents: Individual Rationality, Fairness, and Truthful Contribution</title>

Abstract: We study a collaborative learning problem where $m$ agents aim to estimate a vector $\mu =(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d)\in \mathbb{R}^d$ by sampling from associated univariate normal distributions $\{\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)\}_{k\in[d]}$. Agent $i$ incurs a cost $c_{i,k}$ to sample from $\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)$. Instead of working independently, agents can exchange data, collecting cheaper samples and sharing them in return for costly data, thereby reducing both costs and estimation error. We design a mechanism to facilitate such collaboration, while addressing two key challenges: ensuring individually rational (IR) and fair outcomes so all agents benefit, and preventing strategic behavior (e.g. non-collection, data fabrication) to avoid socially undesirable outcomes. We design a mechanism and an associated Nash equilibrium (NE) which minimizes the social penalty-sum of agents' estimation errors and collection costs-while being IR for all agents. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$-approximation to the minimum social penalty in the worst case and an $\mathcal{O}(1)$-approximation under favorable conditions. Additionally, we establish three hardness results: no nontrivial mechanism guarantees (i) a dominant strategy equilibrium where agents report truthfully, (ii) is IR for every strategy profile of other agents, (iii) or avoids a worst-case $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ price of stability in any NE. Finally, by integrating concepts from axiomatic bargaining, we demonstrate that our mechanism supports fairer outcomes than one which minimizes social penalty.

Abstract: Reliable transcription of child-adult conversations in clinical settings is crucial for diagnosing developmental disorders like Autism. Recent advances in deep learning and availability of large scale transcribed data has led to development of speech foundation models that have shown dramatic improvements in ASR performance. However, their performance on conversational child-adult interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of ASR performance on a dataset containing child-adult interactions from autism diagnostic sessions, using Whisper, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM. We find that speech foundation models show a noticeable performance drop (15-20% absolute WER) for child speech compared to adult speech in the conversational setting. Then, we fine-tune the best-performing zero-shot model (Whisper-large) using LoRA in a low-resource setting, yielding 8% and 13% absolute WER improvements for child and adult speech, respectively.

Abstract: The Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework has been extensively studied for classification and, more recently, regression tasks. However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning -- commonly used in multi-task models -- affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) has traditionally relied on support images with annotated keypoints, a process that is often cumbersome and may fail to fully capture the necessary correspondences across diverse object categories. Recent efforts have explored the use of text queries, leveraging their enhanced stability and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches often remain constrained by their reliance on support queries, their failure to fully utilize the rich priors embedded in pre-trained large language models, and the limitations imposed by their parametric distribution assumptions. To address these challenges, we introduce CapeLLM, the first multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for CAPE. Our method only employs query image and detailed text descriptions as an input to estimate category-agnostic keypoints. Our method encompasses effective training strategies and carefully designed instructions for applying the MLLM to CAPE. Moreover, we propose an inference mechanism that further enhances the reasoning process for unseen keypoints. while flexibly modeling their underlying spatial distribution and uncertainty, allowing for adaptive refinement based on contextual cues. We conducted extensive experiments to apply the MLLM to CAPE effectively, focusing not only on the model architecture and prompt design but also on ensuring robustness across input variations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the MP-100 benchmark in the 1-shot and even 5-shot setting, marking a significant advancement in the field of category-agnostic pose estimation. Code is available at https://github.com/Junhojuno/CapeLLM.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) defenses protect against various risks to security, privacy, and fairness. Real-life models need simultaneous protection against multiple different risks which necessitates combining multiple defenses. But combining defenses with conflicting interactions in an ML model can be ineffective, incurring a significant drop in the effectiveness of one or more defenses being combined. Practitioners need a way to determine if a given combination can be effective. Experimentally identifying effective combinations can be time-consuming and expensive, particularly when multiple defenses need to be combined. We need an inexpensive, easy-to-use combination technique to identify effective combinations. Ideally, a combination technique should be (a) accurate (correctly identifies whether a combination is effective or not), (b) scalable (allows combining multiple defenses), (c) non-invasive (requires no change to the defenses being combined), and (d) general (is applicable to different types of defenses). Prior works have identified several ad-hoc techniques but none satisfy all the requirements above. We propose a principled combination technique, Def\Con, to identify effective defense combinations. Def\Con meets all requirements, achieving 90% accuracy on eight combinations explored in prior work and 81% in 30 previously unexplored combinations that we empirically evaluate in this paper.

Abstract: Music style transfer enables personalized music creation by combining the structure of one piece with the stylistic characteristics of another. While recent approaches have explored text-conditioned generation and diffusion-based synthesis, most require extensive training, paired datasets, or detailed textual annotations. In this work, we introduce Stylus, a novel training-free framework for music style transfer that directly manipulates the self-attention layers of a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Operating in the mel-spectrogram domain, Stylus transfers musical style by replacing key and value representations from the content audio with those of the style reference, without any fine-tuning. To enhance stylization quality and controllability, we further incorporate query preservation, CFG-inspired guidance scaling, multi-style interpolation, and phase-preserving reconstruction. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality and structural preservation compared to prior work, while remaining lightweight and easy to deploy. This work highlights the potential of diffusion-based attention manipulation for efficient, high-fidelity, and interpretable music generation-without training. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying deep neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning and computer vision. One promising, yet only preliminarily explored approach, is feature inversion, which attempts to reconstruct images from intermediate representations using trained inverse neural networks. In this study, we revisit feature inversion, introducing a novel, modular variation that enables significantly more efficient application of the technique. We demonstrate how our method can be systematically applied to the large-scale transformer-based vision models, Detection Transformer and Vision Transformer, and how reconstructed images can be qualitatively interpreted in a meaningful way. We further quantitatively evaluate our method, thereby uncovering underlying mechanisms of representing image features that emerge in the two transformer architectures. Our analysis reveals key insights into how these models encode contextual shape and image details, how their layers correlate, and their robustness against color perturbations. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of transformer-based vision models and their internal representations. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at github.com/wiskott-lab/inverse-tvm.

Abstract: In fishery science, harvest management of size-structured stochastic populations is a long-standing and difficult problem. Rectilinear precautionary policies based on biomass and harvesting reference points have now become a standard approach to this problem. While these standard feedback policies are adapted from analytical or dynamic programming solutions assuming relatively simple ecological dynamics, they are often applied to more complicated ecological settings in the real world. In this paper we explore the problem of designing harvest control rules for partially observed, age-structured, spasmodic fish populations using tools from reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian optimization. Our focus is on the case of Walleye fisheries in Alberta, Canada, whose highly variable recruitment dynamics have perplexed managers and ecologists. We optimized and evaluated policies using several complementary performance metrics. The main questions we addressed were: 1. How do standard policies based on reference points perform relative to numerically optimized policies? 2. Can an observation of mean fish weight, in addition to stock biomass, aid policy decisions?

Abstract: To deal with high-dimensional unlabeled datasets in many areas, principal component analysis (PCA) has become a rising technique for unsupervised feature selection (UFS). However, most existing PCA-based methods only consider the structure of datasets by embedding a single sparse regularization or constraint on the transformation matrix. In this paper, we introduce a novel bi-sparse method called BSUFS to improve the performance of UFS. The core idea of BSUFS is to incorporate $\ell_{2,p}$-norm and $\ell_q$-norm into the classical PCA, which enables our method to select relevant features and filter out irrelevant noises, thereby obtaining discriminative features. Here, the parameters $p$ and $q$ are within the range of $[0, 1)$. Therefore, BSUFS not only constructs a unified framework for bi-sparse optimization, but also includes some existing works as special cases. To solve the resulting non-convex model, we propose an efficient proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm using Stiefel manifold optimization and sparse optimization techniques. In addition, the computational complexity analysis is presented. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed BSUFS. The results reveal the advantages of bi-sparse optimization in feature selection and show its potential for other fields in image processing. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/BSUFS.

Abstract: Traditional biometric systems have encountered significant setbacks due to various unavoidable factors, for example, wearing of face masks in face recognition-based biometrics and hygiene concerns in fingerprint-based biometrics. This paper proposes a novel lightweight vision transformer with phase-only cross-attention (POC-ViT) using dual biometric traits of forehead and periocular portions of the face, capable of performing well even with face masks and without any physical touch, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. The POC-ViT framework is designed to handle two biometric traits and to capture inter-dependencies in terms of relative structural patterns. Each channel consists of a Cross-Attention using phase-only correlation (POC) that captures both their individual and correlated structural patterns. The computation of cross-attention using POC extracts the phase correlation in the spatial features. Therefore, it is robust against variations in resolution and intensity, as well as illumination changes in the input images. The lightweight model is suitable for edge device deployment. The performance of the proposed framework was successfully demonstrated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database, having 350 subjects. The POC-ViT framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods with an outstanding classification accuracy of $98.8\%$ with the dual biometric traits.

Abstract: Two-stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables optimal task delegation by assigning each input to either a fixed main model or one of several offline experts, supporting reliable decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments. However, existing L2D frameworks assume clean inputs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate query allocation--causing costly misrouting or expert overload. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial robustness in two-stage L2D systems. We introduce two novel attack strategie--untargeted and targeted--which respectively disrupt optimal allocations or force queries to specific agents. To defend against such threats, we propose SARD, a convex learning algorithm built on a family of surrogate losses that are provably Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent. These guarantees hold across classification, regression, and multi-task settings. Empirical results demonstrate that SARD significantly improves robustness under adversarial attacks while maintaining strong clean performance, marking a critical step toward secure and trustworthy L2D deployment.

Abstract: Query expansion is widely used in Information Retrieval (IR) to improve search outcomes by supplementing initial queries with richer information. While recent Large Language Model (LLM) based methods generate pseudo-relevant content and expanded terms via multiple prompts, they often yield homogeneous, narrow expansions that lack the diverse context needed to retrieve relevant information. In this paper, we propose AMD: a new Agent-Mediated Dialogic Framework that engages in a dialogic inquiry involving three specialized roles: (1) a Socratic Questioning Agent reformulates the initial query into three sub-questions, with each question inspired by a specific Socratic questioning dimension, including clarification, assumption probing, and implication probing, (2) a Dialogic Answering Agent generates pseudo-answers, enriching the query representation with multiple perspectives aligned to the user's intent, and (3) a Reflective Feedback Agent evaluates and refines these pseudo-answers, ensuring that only the most relevant and informative content is retained. By leveraging a multi-agent process, AMD effectively crafts richer query representations through inquiry and feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including BEIR and TREC demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods, offering a robust solution for retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Quadrupedal locomotion via Reinforcement Learning (RL) is commonly addressed using the teacher-student paradigm, where a privileged teacher guides a proprioceptive student policy. However, key challenges such as representation misalignment between privileged teacher and proprioceptive-only student, covariate shift due to behavioral cloning, and lack of deployable adaptation; lead to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning (TAR), a framework that leverages privileged information with self-supervised contrastive learning to bridge this gap. By aligning representations to a privileged teacher in simulation via contrastive objectives, our student policy learns structured latent spaces and exhibits robust generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, surpassing the fully privileged "Teacher". Results showed accelerated training by 2x compared to state-of-the-art baselines to achieve peak performance. OOD scenarios showed better generalization by 40% on average compared to existing methods. Moreover, TAR transitions seamlessly into learning during deployment without requiring privileged states, setting a new benchmark in sample-efficient, adaptive locomotion and enabling continual fine-tuning in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark and toolkit for occupancy forecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical information) and occupancy prediction (i.e., predicting current-frame occupancy from camera images. UniOcc unifies the data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), providing 2D/3D occupancy labels and annotating innovative per-voxel flows. Unlike existing studies that rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel evaluation metrics that do not depend on ground-truth labels, enabling robust assessment on additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and forecasting performance. Our data and code are available at https://uniocc.github.io/.

Abstract: Tool learning, which allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage external tools for solving complex user tasks, has emerged as a promising avenue for extending model capabilities. However, existing approaches primarily focus on data synthesis for fine-tuning LLMs to invoke tools effectively, largely ignoring how to fully stimulate the potential of the model. In this paper, we propose ToolACE-R, a novel framework that includes both model-aware iterative training and adaptive refinement for tool learning. ToolACE-R features a model-aware iterative training procedure that progressively adjust training samples based on the model's evolving capabilities to maximize its potential. Additionally, it incorporates self-refinement training corpus which emphasizes LLM's ability to iteratively refine their tool calls, optimizing performance without requiring external feedback. Furthermore, we introduce adaptive self-refinement mechanism for efficient test-time scaling, where the trained model can autonomously determine when to stop the process based on iterative self-refinement. We conduct extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, showing that ToolACE-R achieves competitive performance compared to advanced API-based models. The performance of tool invocation can be further improved efficiently through adaptive self-refinement. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of ToolACE-R, offering a promising direction for more efficient and scalable tool learning.

Abstract: Network pruning is used to reduce inference latency and power consumption in large neural networks. However, most existing methods use ad-hoc heuristics, lacking much insight and justified mainly by empirical results. We introduce Hyperflux, a conceptually grounded L0 pruning approach that estimates each weight's importance through its flux, the gradient's response to the weight's removal. A global pressure term continuously drives all weights toward pruning, with those critical for accuracy being automatically regrown based on their flux. We postulate several properties that naturally follow from our framework and experimentally validate each of them. One such property is the relationship between final sparsity and pressure, for which we derive a generalized scaling-law equation that is used to design our sparsity-controlling scheduler. Empirically, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results with ResNet-50 and VGG-19 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we investigate how the computational ability of reservoir recurrent neural networks (RNNs) scales with an increasing number of readout neurons. First, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir RNN scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this observation, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity that incorporates the effect of neuronal correlations, which have been ignored in prior theoretical work for analytical simplicity. Our theory successfully relates the sublinear scaling of memory capacity to the strength of neuronal correlations. Furthermore, we show this principle holds across diverse types of RNNs, even those beyond the direct applicability of our theory. Next, we numerically investigate the scaling behavior of nonlinear computational ability, which, alongside memory capacity, is crucial for overall computational performance. Our numerical simulations reveal that as memory capacity growth becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.

Abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.

<title>Sequential QCQP for Bilevel Optimization with Line Search</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.14647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions. We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate in terms of a first-order stationary metric and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.

<title>Unraveling the iterative CHAD</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation (CHAD) was originally formulated as a semantics-driven source-to-source transformation for reverse-mode AD of total (terminating) functional programs. In this work, we extend CHAD to encompass programs featuring constructs such as partial (potentially non-terminating) operations, data-dependent conditionals (e.g., real-valued tests), and iteration constructs (i.e. while-loops), while maintaining CHAD's core principle of structure-preserving semantics.
  A central contribution is the introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which provide a principled integration of iteration into dependently typed programming languages. This integration is achieved by requiring that iteration in the base category lifts to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed category, yielding an op-fibred iterative structure that models while-loops and other iteration constructs in the total category, which corresponds to the category of containers of our dependently typed language.
  Through the idea of iteration-extensive indexed categories, we extend the CHAD transformation to looping programs as the unique structure-preserving functor in a suitable sense. Specifically, it is the unique iterative Freyd category morphism from the iterative Freyd category corresponding to the source language to the category of containers obtained from the target language, such that each primitive operation is mapped to its (transposed) derivative. We establish the correctness of this extended transformation via the universal property of the syntactic categorical model of the source language, showing that the differentiated programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives of their originals.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal} computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task}, enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is available at https://github.com/bolixinyu/DynamicGroupAttention.

<title>Prompt Attacks Reveal Superficial Knowledge Removal in Unlearning Methods</title>

arXiv:2506.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that certain machine unlearning methods may fail under straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis to assess the extent to which supposedly unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR exhibit robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt attacks (e.g., prepending Hindi filler text to the original prompt recovers 57.3% accuracy). Our logit analysis further indicates that unlearned models are unlikely to hide knowledge through changes in answer formatting, given the strong correlation between output and logit accuracy. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between genuine knowledge removal and superficial output suppression. To facilitate further research, we publicly release our evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve unlearned knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores. However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks. However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

arXiv:2507.08280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of missing values often reflects variations in data collection policies, which may shift across time or locations, even when the underlying feature distribution remains stable. Such shifts in the missingness distribution between training and test inputs pose a significant challenge to achieving robust predictive performance. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework designed to address this challenge, particularly in the common yet challenging scenario where the test-time dataset is unseen. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based conditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide the prediction model to extract label-relevant information. This promotes robustness against distributional shifts in missingness at test-time. To enforce these conditions, we design simple yet effective loss terms that collectively define our final objective, called MIRRAMS. Importantly, our method does not rely on any specific missingness assumption such as MCAR, MAR, or MNAR, making it applicable to a broad range of scenarios. Furthermore, it can naturally extend to cases where labels are also missing in training data, by generalizing the framework to a semi-supervised learning setting. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark tabular datasets demonstrate that MIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines and maintains stable performance under diverse missingness conditions. Moreover, it achieves superior performance even in fully observed settings, highlighting MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose tabular learning.

<title>Oranits: Mission Assignment and Task Offloading in Open RAN-based ITS using Metaheuristic and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS), where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach. First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm, namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and 12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these challenges, we propose FedABC, an innovative client selection algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms, FedABC prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover, considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an optimization problem to guide FedABC throughout the training process. Following the "later-is-better" principle, FedABC adaptively adjusts the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that FedABC significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32% fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm FedAvg, and 3.5% higher accuracy with 2% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments, thereby supporting native AI capabilities in 6G networks.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those works advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.

Abstract: Estimated time of arrival (ETA) for airborne aircraft in real-time is crucial for arrival management in aviation, particularly for runway sequencing. Given the rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as important as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In this study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to efficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to latent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer captures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex feature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation capability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ, which is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs include raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta degree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and aircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA prediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA prediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October 1 to October 31, 2022. In the experimental evaluation, the ETA modeling covers all aircraft within a range of 10NM to 300NM from WSSS. The results show that our proposed method method outperforms the commonly used boosting tree based model, improving accuracy by 7\% compared to XGBoost, while requiring only 39\% of its computing time. Experimental results also indicate that, with 40 aircraft in the airspace at a given timestamp, the ETA inference time is only 51.7 microseconds, making it promising for real-time arrival management systems.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, MoLAN framework, noise suppression, modality-aware blocking, MoLAN+

Summary: 
The paper introduces the MoLAN framework for multimodal sentiment analysis, which addresses the challenge of irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory information commonly faced by existing approaches. MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking by dividing features into multiple blocks and dynamically assigning denoising strengths based on noise level and relevance. This fine-grained noise suppression process preserves essential multimodal information without losing critical data. MoLAN is a flexible and unified framework that can be easily integrated into various multimodal models. The paper also presents MoLAN+, a novel multimodal sentiment analysis approach built upon the MoLAN framework. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of MoLAN across different models and datasets, with MoLAN+ achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code for MoLAN is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and use. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions. However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework. Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/betterfly123/MoLAN-Framework.

Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL) theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt. We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.

Summary:  
JustDense, an empirical study, questions the necessity of complex sequence mixers in time series analysis (TSA) and proposes replacing them with dense layers. The study systematically replaces sequence mixers in established TSA models with dense layers, showing comparable or superior performance in 29 benchmarks across five TSA tasks. The MatrixMixer framework treats sequence mixers as mixing matrices, enabling a clear theoretical understanding of their role. The results challenge the assumption that deeper and more complex architectures are inherently better in TSA, suggesting that simpler architectures can achieve similar performance. By isolating the mixing operation, JustDense offers insights into architectural and optimization factors influencing TSA model performance. <div>

Abstract: Sequence and channel mixers, the core mechanism in sequence models, have become the de facto standard in time series analysis (TSA). However, recent studies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as attention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve comparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits attributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other architectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a central question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series analysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that systematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models with dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any sequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This substitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical foundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive experiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven state-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show that replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even superior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer benefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that "deeper and more complex architectures are inherently better" in TSA.

<div> Deep learning, peer effects, social networks, unobserved confounding, feedback loops

Summary:

DIG2RSI is a novel deep learning framework designed to estimate peer causal effects within complex real-world networks, such as social networks. It addresses the challenges of simultaneous feedback between peers and unobserved confounders. By leveraging I-G transformation and 2SRI techniques, DIG2RSI can capture complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional relationships. The framework disentangles mutual peer influences and eliminates bias from feedback loops using the I-G transformation. It also deals with unobserved confounding by constructing valid instrumental variables from network data. Through a two-stage process, DIG2RSI uses neural networks to predict peer exposure and extract residuals as proxies for unobserved confounders. The framework's consistency under standard conditions ensures accurate estimation of peer effects. Empirical results on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in peer effect estimation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect. Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance self-evaluation in Large Multimodal Models during multi-turn conversations. Traditional RL methods suffer from reward hacking when optimizing multiple objectives, leading to model collapse. AdaPO addresses this issue by introducing an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM evaluates the training state based on model-generated trajectories' performance distribution, while the Dynamic KL Regularization adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward gaps. This adaptive approach allows the model to focus on different sub-tasks' training progress without manual intervention. Experimental results across 8 benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both direct reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. The code will be released to benefit the research community. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Self-evaluation, a model's ability to assess the correctness of its own output, is crucial for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to achieve self-improvement in multi-turn conversations, yet largely absent in foundation models. Recent work has employed reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance self-evaluation; however, its fixed reward mechanism suffers from reward hacking when optimizing multiple training objectives, leading to model collapse. In this paper we propose AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning framework capable of adaptively adjusting training objective in real time according to the current training state for each task. Specifically, to mitigate reward hacking , AdaPO introduces an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM assesses the task's training state from the distribution of model generated multi-turn trajectories' performance. Reward Aware Dynamic KL replaces a fixed penalty with dynamic coefficients which is modulated by the reward gap between different multi-turn situations. Notably, our method automatically and smoothly adjusts its learning focus based on sub-tasks' training progress without manual intervention. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks and various models show that our method significantly enhances both direct reasoning and self-evaluation capability. We will release our code to contribute to the community.

Summary:
This article introduces a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems. The approach involves a post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of governing PDEs, ensuring physical consistency and adherence to boundary conditions without altering the learned distribution. By incorporating a learnable latent parameter predictor, the model can infer unknown physical inputs such as source terms, material parameters, or boundary data through joint optimization. The model produces physically valid field solutions and accurate estimates of hidden parameters, effectively tackling ill-posed inverse problems while remaining data-driven and physics-aware. Validated on canonical PDE benchmarks, the method showcases improved satisfaction of PDE constraints and precise recovery of latent coefficients. This methodology combines generative modelling and scientific inference, offering opportunities for simulation-driven discovery and efficient modelling of physical systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems. Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy. The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical systems.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous driving, trajectory generation, multi-objective reinforcement learning, adversarial optimization, iterative decision-making

Summary:
EvaDrive introduces a novel approach to autonomous driving by combining trajectory generation and evaluation through multi-objective reinforcement learning. The framework creates a closed-loop co-evolution process where trajectory proposals are continuously refined and evaluated in an adversarial game setting. This allows for diverse driving styles without the need for external preference data and avoids scalarization bias common in traditional reinforcement learning methods. EvaDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tests, surpassing existing models in terms of Precision-Recall-Dynamic-Move-Scale (PDMS) and Driving Score metrics. By enabling iterative multi-round refinement guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, EvaDrive can escape local optima and maintain trajectory diversity. This innovative framework offers a scalable and effective solution for human-like iterative decision-making in autonomous driving systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving faces significant challenges in achieving human-like iterative decision-making, which continuously generates, evaluates, and refines trajectory proposals. Current generation-evaluation frameworks isolate trajectory generation from quality assessment, preventing iterative refinement essential for planning, while reinforcement learning methods collapse multi-dimensional preferences into scalar rewards, obscuring critical trade-offs and yielding scalarization bias.To overcome these issues, we present EvaDrive, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that establishes genuine closed-loop co-evolution between trajectory generation and evaluation via adversarial optimization. EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as a multi-round adversarial game. In this game, a hierarchical generator continuously proposes candidate paths by combining autoregressive intent modeling for temporal causality with diffusion-based refinement for spatial flexibility. These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable multi-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures without collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial interplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative multi-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving trajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing DiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving Score on Bench2Drive. EvaDrive generates diverse driving styles via dynamic weighting without external preference data, introducing a closed-loop adversarial framework for human-like iterative decision-making, offering a novel scalarization-free trajectory optimization approach.

Summary:<br />
- Type 1 diabetes leads to insulin deficiency, requiring external insulin injections and increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.
- Data analysis plays a crucial role in improving diabetes care by identifying patterns and trends to predict and prevent adverse events.
- Machine learning models can predict glucose levels and provide early warnings for hypoglycemia.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the destruction of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insulin deficiency, as to why the affected individuals depend on external insulin injections. However, insulin can decrease blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a severe event of low blood glucose levels ($\le$70 mg/dL) with dangerous side effects of dizziness, coma, or death. Data analysis can significantly enhance diabetes care by identifying personal patterns and trends leading to adverse events. Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and provide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by the unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates 15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose measurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are included, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two sub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and sub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an equal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution, data quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values present a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose levels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55 minutes before hypoglycemia.

Abstract: Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient resource management and sustainability in the building sector. Deep learning models are highly successful but struggle with limited historical data and become unusable when historical data are unavailable, such as in newly constructed buildings. On the other hand, physics-based models, such as EnergyPlus, simulate energy consumption without relying on historical data but require extensive building parameter specifications and considerable time to model a building. This paper introduces a Physics-Guided Memory Network (PgMN), a neural network that integrates predictions from deep learning and physics-based models to address their limitations. PgMN comprises a Parallel Projection Layers to process incomplete inputs, a Memory Unit to account for persistent biases, and a Memory Experience Module to optimally extend forecasts beyond their input range and produce output. Theoretical evaluation shows that components of PgMN are mathematically valid for performing their respective tasks. The PgMN was evaluated on short-term energy forecasting at an hourly resolution, critical for operational decision-making in smart grid and smart building systems. Experimental validation shows accuracy and applicability of PgMN in diverse scenarios such as newly constructed buildings, missing data, sparse historical data, and dynamic infrastructure changes. This paper provides a promising solution for energy consumption forecasting in dynamic building environments, enhancing model applicability in scenarios where historical data are limited or unavailable or when physics-based models are inadequate.

Summary:<br /><br />Next generation nuclear reactors will rely on fully digital instrumentation and control systems, generating multivariate time series data. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is crucial. Current approaches focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection but do not fully characterize the root cause of anomalies. This study proposes an unsupervised explainable AI framework using an autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to characterize real-time replay attacks in nuclear cyber-physical systems. The framework accurately detects and identifies the source, number, and duration of signals being replayed, achieving 95% accuracy on real-world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor. This approach addresses the need for a more comprehensive understanding of replay attacks and improves the safety and reliability of nuclear reactors. <div>
arXiv:2508.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.

Summary: 
Stochastic computing (SC) is proposed as a low-power option for neural networks (NNs) in IoT environments. A new approach, Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), is introduced to improve layer-wise mixed-precision implementation in SC NNs. ASL leverages operator-norm-based theoretical models to analyze truncation noise propagation through layers and optimize sequence length configurations. A sensitivity analysis validates the effectiveness of ASL in reducing energy and latency overheads by up to 60% with minimal accuracy loss. Two truncation strategies, coarse-grained and fine-grained, are proposed to cater to different application scenarios. Evaluation on a 32nm pipelined SC MLP confirms the benefits of ASL for IoT applications and highlights the advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs. <div>
arXiv:2508.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) has emerged as an efficient low-power alternative for deploying neural networks (NNs) in resource-limited scenarios, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). By encoding values as serial bitstreams, SC significantly reduces energy dissipation compared to conventional floating-point (FP) designs; however, further improvement of layer-wise mixed-precision implementation for SC remains unexplored. This article introduces Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), a novel scheme that applies mixed-precision concepts specifically to SC NNs. By introducing an operator-norm-based theoretical model, this article shows that truncation noise can cumulatively propagate through the layers by the estimated amplification factors. An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest (RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the alignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To accommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two truncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse sequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP synthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency overheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss. It confirms the feasibility of the ASL scheme for IoT applications and highlights the distinct advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs.

<div> Population synthesis, deep generative models, diffusion model, attribute combinations, feasibility<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Population synthesis is a crucial task in agent-based modeling for intelligent transportation systems. With large numbers of attributes, sparsity in survey data can make accurate population modeling challenging. A novel diffusion model-based approach is proposed to estimate the joint distribution of a population, allowing for the recovery of missing sampling zeros while minimizing generated structural zeros. Compared to existing methods like VAE and GAN, this approach strikes a better balance between feasibility and diversity in the synthesized population. The performance is evaluated using metrics such as marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and diversity, showing superior results in accurately representing the population. <div>

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical task that involves generating synthetic yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in agent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze intelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the primary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents represented by population members. However, when the number of attributes describing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of dimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and produce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from available sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute combinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the sample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of falsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in the population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion model-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying joint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of numerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros minimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population synthesis. We assess the performance of the synthesized outputs using a range of metrics, including marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and diversity. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches in achieving a better balance between the feasibility and diversity of the synthesized population.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached 0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current optimal large-scale pre-training model ECGFounder, it has improved by 0.111 and 0.19.

Summary:
The article introduces a lightweight training-free approach, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to address the modality gap in large multimodal models (LMMs). By using a linear mapping technique, RAG efficiently extends across modalities by retrieving closest textual descriptions from the training set to generate new descriptions. An iterative method is introduced to optimize the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions through a language model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements in image description generation. The proposed approach mitigates the need for costly fine-tuning by leveraging existing textual data for improved multimodal input processing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.

The article introduces FedMP, a novel method aimed at improving federated learning in non-IID scenarios, particularly in medical imaging applications. FedMP utilizes stochastic feature manifold completion to enhance individual client classifiers and employs class-prototypes to align feature manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, enabling the creation of distinct decision boundaries.

arXiv:2508.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their local private data. However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter challenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly pronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature distributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method designed to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic feature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client classifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating the construction of more distinct decision boundaries. We validate the effectiveness of FedMP on multiple medical imaging datasets, including those with real-world multi-center distributions, as well as on a multi-domain natural image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMP outperforms existing FL algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the impact of manifold dimensionality, communication efficiency, and privacy implications of feature exposure in our method.

<div> Keywords: dynamic quantization, mixed-precision, integer-only hardware, bit-shift operation, ResNet.

Summary: 
Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT) is a novel framework for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices. It introduces instance-based mixed-precision quantization, adapting to varying input complexity for superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off. DQT utilizes a nested integer representation and custom integer-only arithmetic to enable on-the-fly bit-width switching through a low-cost bit-shift operation, eliminating the need for costly dequantization and requantization cycles. This makes DQT the first framework to support efficient dynamic quantization without breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm. DQT achieves state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 and ResNet50, with a 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieving 77.00% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Importantly, DQT incurs a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M bit-shift operations, significantly outperforming previous dynamic approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. This breakthrough in adaptive AI represents a new frontier in deep learning model deployment on resource-constrained devices.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices relies on quantization. While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width to all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic, instance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed. However, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly dequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision, breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains. This paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework that removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer representation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within higher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only arithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost bit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable both dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and truly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight controller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate DQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on ImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1 accuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET, 76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this with a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a drastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) floating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a new frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.

<div> Keywords: single-cell RNA sequencing, cell type annotation, clustering, graph neural networks, contrastive learning<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Accurate cell type annotation is crucial in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to understand cellular heterogeneity. Traditional clustering methods struggle with the high dimensionality and zero elements in scRNA-seq data. To address these challenges, scAGC, a novel clustering method, learns adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. It optimizes feature representations and cell graphs simultaneously using a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder and a Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to refine graph structures dynamically. The use of a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss helps model the distinct nature of scRNA-seq data, and a contrastive learning objective ensures stability and convergence in graph learning. Experimental results on 9 real datasets show that scAGC outperforms existing methods, achieving the best NMI and ARI scores on most datasets. This method provides a robust and effective approach for cell type annotation in scRNA-seq data analysis.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which provides valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity. However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero elements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant statistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph neural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static graph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the long-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these limitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature representations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the graph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem of a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood structure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of scRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for robust feature reconstruction. Furthermore, a contrastive learning objective is incorporated to regularize the graph learning process and prevent abrupt changes in the graph topology, ensuring stability and enhancing convergence. Comprehensive experiments on 9 real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scAGC consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, yielding the best NMI and ARI scores on 9 and 7 datasets, respectively.Our code is available at Anonymous Github.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction (LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism. Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios, demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by non-IID data.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges posed by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in injecting domain-specific knowledge while introducing safety risks. Various defense strategies have been proposed for alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, but they often lack a comprehensive consideration of safety layers and fine-grained neurons. To address this, the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method is proposed to reduce fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN integrates multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with task neurons. Safety neuron parameters are then projected onto safety directions to enhance model safety and align with human preferences. Experimental results across multiple fine-tuned LLM models show that the method significantly reduces harmfulness scores and attack success rates while preserving model utility. Additionally, a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism enhances continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen safety concerns.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.

Summary: 
TokenCast is a framework for time series forecasting that integrates historical numerical sequences with contextual features using language-based symbolic representations. It transforms continuous numerical sequences into temporal tokens and aligns them with contextual tokens through a pre-trained large language model (LLM). This shared representation space is optimized with autoregressive generative objectives to bridge the semantic gap between modalities. The aligned LLM is then fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are decoded back into the original numerical space. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast in improving forecasting accuracy by leveraging contextual information. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making across a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and finance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives. Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.

<div> Keywords: dLLMs, diffusion large language models, autoregressive, inference speed, parallel decoding <br />
Summary:<br />
Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) are being explored as a viable option for text generation, offering the potential to decode multiple tokens simultaneously. However, existing dLLMs have not been able to surpass the inference speed of autoregressive (AR) LLMs of similar size. This paper introduces a novel approach called discrete diffusion forcing (D2F) to enhance the efficiency of dLLMs. D2F equips dLLMs with block-wise autoregressive generation and the ability to predict following tokens without completing prior blocks, transforming them into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm. Through an asymmetric distillation process and a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm, D2F dLLMs achieve significantly faster inference speeds compared to existing dLLMs like LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5 on GSM8K dataset. The code for D2F is available on GitHub, offering a more than 50x acceleration in inference speed while maintaining comparable output quality. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference. D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm, which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable output quality.

<div> Keywords: generative modeling, natural language, procedural content generation, multi-objective instructions, controllability

Summary: 
Generative modeling has advanced, highlighting the importance of natural language for controlling content generation efficiently. However, current methods struggle with leveraging textual input, especially with complex instructions, limiting controllability. To address this, the proposed method, MIPCGRL, utilizes multi-objective representation learning, incorporating sentence embeddings as conditions. By incorporating multi-label classification and multi-head regression networks, MIPCGRL effectively trains a multi-objective embedding space, resulting in improved controllability with multi-objective instructions, achieving up to a 13.8% enhancement. This capability to process complex instructions allows for more expressive and flexible content generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling emphasize the importance of natural language as a highly expressive and accessible modality for controlling content generation. However, existing instructed reinforcement learning for procedural content generation (IPCGRL) method often struggle to leverage the expressive richness of textual input, especially under complex, multi-objective instructions, leading to limited controllability. To address this problem, we propose \textit{MIPCGRL}, a multi-objective representation learning method for instructed content generators, which incorporates sentence embeddings as conditions. MIPCGRL effectively trains a multi-objective embedding space by incorporating multi-label classification and multi-head regression networks. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to a 13.8\% improvement in controllability with multi-objective instructions. The ability to process complex instructions enables more expressive and flexible content generation.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs), incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This framework automates the selection process by learning from historical performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition, our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and economically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the inefficiencies of current coupon distribution strategies on online platforms and proposes a new framework called Aligned Decision Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons) to improve revenue and user engagement. The framework is designed to optimize online decision-making by considering general scenarios, sequential modeling with comprehensive historical data, and efficient iterative updates. Empirical results on real-world industrial datasets, as well as public and synthetic datasets, showcase the effectiveness of the ADT4Coupons framework in enhancing long-term revenue. <div>

Abstract: Coupon distribution is a critical marketing strategy used by online platforms to boost revenue and enhance user engagement. Regrettably, existing coupon distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight, despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios, sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models. We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

Abstract: Laser-enabled selective transfer, a key process in high-throughput microLED fabrication, requires computational models that can plan shift sequences to minimize motion of XY stages and adapt to varying optimization objectives across the substrate. We propose the first repair algorithm based on a differentiable transfer module designed to model discrete shifts of transfer platforms, while remaining trainable via gradient-based optimization. Compared to local proximity searching algorithms, our approach achieves superior repair performance and enables more flexible objective designs, such as minimizing the number of steps. Unlike reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches, our method eliminates the need for handcrafted feature extractors and trains significantly faster, allowing scalability to large arrays. Experiments show a 50% reduction in transfer steps and sub-2-minute planning time on 2000x2000 arrays. This method provides a practical and adaptable solution for accelerating microLED repair in AR/VR and next-generation display fabrication.

<div> Keywords: Test-time adaptation, Hierarchical Adaptive Networks, Dynamic layer selection, Linear layer agreement, Robustness.

Summary:
Hi-Vec is a novel approach for test-time adaptation that utilizes hierarchical adaptive networks with task vectors. It decomposes the encoder's representation space into multiple layers to handle diverse and complex shifts in incoming data streams. The method includes dynamic layer selection for optimal adaptation, weight merging to ensure all layers receive target information, and linear layer agreement as a gating function to prevent fine-tuning on noisy batches. In rigorous evaluations, Hi-Vec outperformed existing methods in challenging scenarios and on multiple target datasets, demonstrating improved robustness, uncertainty handling, and efficacy in limited batch sizes and increased outlier rates. Hi-Vec represents a significant advancement in test-time adaptation techniques, offering a versatile and effective solution for addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation allows pretrained models to adjust to incoming data streams, addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains. However, standard methods rely on single-dimensional linear classification layers, which often fail to handle diverse and complex shifts. We propose Hierarchical Adaptive Networks with Task Vectors (Hi-Vec), which leverages multiple layers of increasing size for dynamic test-time adaptation. By decomposing the encoder's representation space into such hierarchically organized layers, Hi-Vec, in a plug-and-play manner, allows existing methods to adapt to shifts of varying complexity. Our contributions are threefold: First, we propose dynamic layer selection for automatic identification of the optimal layer for adaptation to each test batch. Second, we propose a mechanism that merges weights from the dynamic layer to other layers, ensuring all layers receive target information. Third, we propose linear layer agreement that acts as a gating function, preventing erroneous fine-tuning by adaptation on noisy batches. We rigorously evaluate the performance of Hi-Vec in challenging scenarios and on multiple target datasets, proving its strong capability to advance state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that Hi-Vec improves robustness, addresses uncertainty, and handles limited batch sizes and increased outlier rates.

The model includes a task corrector to extract complex behavioral patterns from trajectory data, clustering historical trajectories to identify motion patterns.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction for buses is crucial in intelligent transportation systems, particularly within urban environments. In developing regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.

This paper introduces a novel framework for tabular data modeling using large language models (LLMs). The framework allows for effective utilization of LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios by generating feature values based on task and feature descriptions. This approach enables the creation of zero-shot prototypes without the need for training a classifier or finetuning the LLMs. By using an example-free prompt, the framework overcomes constraints associated with example-based prompts, making it scalable and robust.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to in-depth investigation of their potential in tabular data modeling. However, effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt, providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.

Summary:
- The study aims to develop a general system for odor detection using local field potentials (LFPs) from the olfactory bulb.
- Two hypotheses were tested: spectral features of LFPs are enough for robust single-trial odor detection, and signals from the olfactory bulb alone are sufficient.
- An ensemble of convolutional networks (ResCNN and AttentionCNN) was used to decode the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory bulb LFPs.
- The model achieved high accuracy (86.6%), F1-score (81.0%), and AUC (0.9247), outperforming previous benchmarks.
- Results demonstrate the feasibility of robust single-trial odor detection from LFPs and the potential of deep learning models in understanding olfactory representations.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Odor detection underpins food safety, environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and many more fields. The current artificial sensors developed for odor detection struggle with complex mixtures while non-invasive recordings lack reliable single-trial fidelity. To develop a general system for odor detection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two hypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are sufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from the olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an ensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and AttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory bulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble model supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score of 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous benchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework captures biologically significant signatures. These findings establish the feasibility of robust single-trial detection of the presence of odor from extracellular LFPs, as well as demonstrate the potential of deep learning models to provide a deeper understanding of olfactory representations.

<div> Graph neural networks, GNNs, over-squashing, rewiring techniques, topology, empirical analyses.

Summary:
Over-squashing in message-passing GNNs limits expressivity due to exponential compression of long-range information. A new method assesses over-squashing between node pairs by their mutual sensitivity decay rate. This method is extended to graph-level statistics. Empirical analyses on various benchmarks show most graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing. Rewiring strategies effectively mitigate over-squashing, with varying degrees of success depending on dataset and method. Node classification datasets show less notable over-squashing, and the effects of rewiring are inconsistent. Rewiring is most beneficial for substantially over-squashed graphs when applied with restraint. Aggressive rewiring or applying it to minimally over-squashed graphs may not improve performance and could even harm it. A diagnostic tool allows practitioners to assess the potential benefits of rewiring before training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing -- exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity). Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring, or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.

Summary: 
This paper explores the vulnerabilities of collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) to adversarial attacks, focusing on realistic conditions where adversaries can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. The study introduces effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations that deceive victim agents by misaligning their perception of the environment. The proposed approach is tested on three benchmarks and 22 environments, showcasing its robustness across various algorithms and scenarios. Importantly, the algorithm demonstrates high sample efficiency, requiring only 1,000 samples compared to millions in previous methods.

Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) has rapidly evolved, offering state-of-the-art algorithms for real-world applications, including sensitive domains. However, a key challenge to its widespread adoption is the lack of a thorough investigation into its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Existing work predominantly focuses on training-time attacks or unrealistic scenarios, such as access to policy weights or the ability to train surrogate policies. In this paper, we investigate new vulnerabilities under more realistic and constrained conditions, assuming an adversary can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. We also consider scenarios where the adversary has no access at all. We propose simple yet highly effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations designed to misalign how victim agents perceive their environment. Our approach is empirically validated on three benchmarks and 22 environments, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse algorithms and environments. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm is sample-efficient, requiring only 1,000 samples compared to the millions needed by previous methods.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel framework for automated Knowledge Component (KC) discovery in computer science education. The framework utilizes pattern-based KCs to capture recurring structural patterns within student code, allowing for more accurate knowledge modeling. By training a Variational Autoencoder guided by an explainable, attention-based code representation model, important patterns are extracted from student code and clustered to form pattern-based KCs. Evaluation methods including learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) show significant improvements in predictive performance over traditional methods. This approach enhances knowledge modeling in CS education by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable way to identify key code patterns and algorithmic constructs necessary for student learning. <div>
arXiv:2508.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective personalized learning in computer science education depends on accurately modeling what students know and what they need to learn. While Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel, explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs: recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student learning.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses a large dataset into a small synthetic dataset such that learning on the synthetic dataset approximates learning on the original. Training on the distilled dataset can be performed in as little as one step of gradient descent. We demonstrate that distillation is generalizable to different tasks by distilling reinforcement learning environments into one-batch supervised learning datasets. This demonstrates not only distillation's ability to compress a reinforcement learning task but also its ability to transform one learning modality (reinforcement learning) into another (supervised learning). We present a novel extension of proximal policy optimization for meta-learning and use it in distillation of a multi-dimensional extension of the classic cart-pole problem, all MuJoCo environments, and several Atari games. We demonstrate distillation's ability to compress complex RL environments into one-step supervised learning, explore RL distillation's generalizability across learner architectures, and demonstrate distilling an environment into the smallest-possible synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture, and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance the system's security, we introduce a reputation-based voting mechanism that assesses the trustworthiness of submitted models while utilizing the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient off-chain storage. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only improves forecasting accuracy but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification tasks.

<br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a new magnitude-based synaptic pruning method for artificial neural networks that mimics biological synaptic pruning. The method gradually removes low-importance connections during training, improving efficiency. Integrated directly into the training loop, this approach computes weight importance across layers and progressively increases global sparsity using a cubic schedule. By eliminating the need for separate pruning and fine-tuning phases, it simplifies the process. Experimental results on various time series forecasting models demonstrate consistent gains, with the method outperforming traditional dropout techniques significantly. In financial forecasting tasks, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% compared to models without or with standard dropout, and up to 52% in certain transformer models. This dynamic pruning mechanism offers a practical alternative for regularization, showcasing its potential in diverse architectures.

Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology by progressively removing low-importance connections during training. Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01). In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models. This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to conventional dropout techniques.

<div> Keywords: RicciFlowRec, recommendation framework, Ricci curvature, financial graphs, risk-aware ranking

Summary:
RicciFlowRec is a novel recommendation framework that utilizes Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial graphs to attribute root causes in the financial domain. By analyzing interactions between stocks, macroeconomic indicators, and news, the framework quantifies local stress and traces shock propagation through Ricci flow. The use of discrete Ricci curvature helps identify causal substructures, leading to a structural risk-aware ranking function. Initial results on S&amp;P 500 data combined with sentiment analysis from FinBERT show improved robustness and interpretability in the face of synthetic perturbations. This work lays the foundation for curvature-based attribution and risk-aware ranking, with future plans to incorporate portfolio optimization and return forecasting. RicciFlowRec represents a pioneering effort in applying geometric flow-based reasoning to financial decision-making support.

Abstract: We propose RicciFlowRec, a geometric recommendation framework that performs root cause attribution via Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial graphs. By modelling evolving interactions among stocks, macroeconomic indicators, and news, we quantify local stress using discrete Ricci curvature and trace shock propagation via Ricci flow. Curvature gradients reveal causal substructures, informing a structural risk-aware ranking function. Preliminary results on S\&amp;P~500 data with FinBERT-based sentiment show improved robustness and interpretability under synthetic perturbations. This ongoing work supports curvature-based attribution and early-stage risk-aware ranking, with plans for portfolio optimization and return forecasting. To our knowledge, RicciFlowRec is the first recommender to apply geometric flow-based reasoning in financial decision support.

<div> Sparse autoencoders, domain-specific features, medical text, interpretability, Gemma-2 models<br />
Summary:<br />
The study focuses on improving the interpretability of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) by training them on domain-specific data, specifically medical text. By confining the training of SAEs to medical text, the researchers found that the models were able to capture more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce linear residual error compared to SAEs trained on broad data distributions. The domain-specific SAEs were able to provide a more complete and interpretable latent decomposition, aligning with clinically meaningful concepts. The results suggest that domain-confinement can address key limitations of broad-domain SAEs and highlight the importance of considering domain-specific training for enhanced model performance and interpretability. The findings challenge the notion of scaling foundation models for general-purpose SAEs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure. Conventional SAEs train on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only high-frequency, generic patterns. This often results in significant linear ``dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or absorb each other, complicating interpretation. We show that restricting SAE training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and interpretability. Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2 models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs. Automated and human evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful concepts (e.g., ``taste sensations'' or ``infectious mononucleosis''), rather than frequent but uninformative tokens. These domain-specific SAEs capture relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual. We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and suggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for general-purpose SAEs.

Summary: 
In this study, researchers investigated the alignment between pathological speech information related to dementia and generated images using text-to-image models. Surprisingly, they discovered that dementia detection could be achieved solely from the generated images with an impressive 75% accuracy rate on the ADReSS dataset. Additionally, the researchers developed methods to explain the alignment, shedding light on the specific language components that contribute to the detection. This finding demonstrates the potential of utilizing text-to-image models in the context of dementia-related speech analysis and highlights the effectiveness of explainability methods in revealing the underlying mechanisms of alignment between speech information and generated images. <div>
arXiv:2508.09385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image models generate highly realistic images based on natural language descriptions and millions of users use them to create and share images online. While it is expected that such models can align input text and generated image in the same latent space little has been done to understand whether this alignment is possible between pathological speech and generated images. In this work, we examine the ability of such models to align dementia-related speech information with the generated images and develop methods to explain this alignment. Surprisingly, we found that dementia detection is possible from generated images alone achieving 75% accuracy on the ADReSS dataset. We then leverage explainability methods to show which parts of the language contribute to the detection.

Summary:<br />
This paper presents a novel risk assessment framework for collaborative financial risk analysis across multiple institutions. The method utilizes federated learning, allowing institutions to jointly model and identify risks without sharing raw data. Using a feature attention mechanism and temporal modeling structure, the model employs distributed optimization to train local sub-models at each institution. Differential privacy and noise injection protect model parameters before aggregation by a central server to generate a global model for systemic risk identification. Experimental results demonstrate the model's superior performance in communication efficiency, model accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization compared to traditional centralized methods and existing federated learning variants. The proposed method enhances risk identification scope and efficiency while safeguarding data sovereignty, providing a secure and efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and collaborative modeling in cross-institution financial risk analysis. It proposes a risk assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores, enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics, demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential for practical deployment.

<br />
Summary: 
Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks (IHGNN) introduce a novel approach to modeling higher-order relations in group-based interactions. Unlike traditional hypergraph neural networks with fixed message-passing layers, IHGNN computes representations through a nonlinear fixed-point equation, allowing for stable and efficient global propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. A well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analysis of oversmoothing conditions and model expressivity, as well as a transductive generalization bound on hypergraphs, are developed. The implicit-gradient training procedure and projection-based stabilization strategy enhance training robustness. Experimental results on citation benchmarks demonstrate that IHGNN outperforms traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in accuracy and robustness, showing resilience to random initialization and hyperparameter variation. This highlights the strong generalization and practical value of IHGNN for higher-order relational learning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world interactions are group-based rather than pairwise such as papers with multiple co-authors and users jointly engaging with items. Hypergraph neural networks have shown great promise at modeling higher-order relations, but their reliance on a fixed number of explicit message-passing layers limits long-range dependency capture and can destabilize training as depth grows. In this work, we introduce Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks (IHGNN), which bring the implicit equilibrium formulation to hypergraphs: instead of stacking layers, IHGNN computes representations as the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation, enabling stable and efficient global propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. We develop a well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analyze the oversmoothing conditions and expressivity of the model, and derive a transductive generalization bound on hypergraphs. We further present an implicit-gradient training procedure coupled with a projection-based stabilization strategy. Extensive experiments on citation benchmarks show that IHGNN consistently outperforms strong traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Empirically, IHGNN is resilient to random initialization and hyperparameter variation, highlighting its strong generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning.

arXiv:2508.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road traffic congestion is a persistent problem. Focusing resources on the causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and computation speed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements, with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE, respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains. We will release the code shortly.

Abstract: A reliable fault diagnosis system should not only accurately classify known health states but also effectively identify unknown faults. In multimode processes, samples belonging to the same health state often show multiple cluster distributions, making it difficult to construct compact and accurate decision boundaries for that state. To address this challenge, a novel open-set fault diagnosis model named fine-grained clustering and rejection network (FGCRN) is proposed. It combines multiscale depthwise convolution, bidirectional gated recurrent unit and temporal attention mechanism to capture discriminative features. A distance-based loss function is designed to enhance the intra-class compactness. Fine-grained feature representations are constructed through unsupervised learning to uncover the intrinsic structures of each health state. Extreme value theory is employed to model the distance between sample features and their corresponding fine-grained representations, enabling effective identification of unknown faults. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the design of high-performing neural networks but typically targets a single predefined task, thereby restricting its real-world applicability. To address this, Meta Neural Architecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that leverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones. Nevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS first models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy is developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural architectures. The search strategy combines global architecture search via Bayesian Optimization in the search space with local exploration for novel neural networks via gradient ascent in the latent space. Such a hybrid search strategy allows GraB-NAS to discover task-aware architectures with strong performance, even beyond the predefined search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines, achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies, inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model, DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models. These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation smart systems.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more widely adopted and scale up in size, the computational and memory challenges involved in deploying these massive foundation models have grown increasingly severe. This underscores the urgent need to develop more efficient model variants. Faced with this challenge, the present work introduces EGGS-PTP: an Expander-Graph Guided Structured Post-training Pruning method. The proposed approach leverages graph theory to guide the design of N:M structured pruning, effectively reducing model size and computational demands. By incorporating concepts from expander graphs, EGGS-PTP ensures information flow within the pruned network, preserving essential model functionality. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that EGGS-PTP not only achieves significant acceleration and memory savings due to structured sparsity but also outperforms existing structured pruning techniques in terms of accuracy across various LLMs.

<title>NeuronTune: Fine-Grained Neuron Modulation for Balanced Safety-Utility Alignment in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries, degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds, supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.

<title>Large-Small Model Collaborative Framework for Federated Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for Foundation Models (FMs) is an essential yet underexplored challenge, especially in Federated Continual Learning (FCL), where each client learns from a private, evolving task stream under strict data and communication constraints. Despite their powerful generalization abilities, FMs often exhibit suboptimal performance on local downstream tasks, as they are unable to utilize private local data. Furthermore, enabling FMs to learn new tasks without forgetting prior knowledge is inherently a challenging problem, primarily due to their immense parameter count and high model complexity. In contrast, small models can be trained locally under resource-constrained conditions and benefit from more mature CL techniques. To bridge the gap between small models and FMs, we propose the first collaborative framework in FCL, where lightweight local models act as a dynamic bridge, continually adapting to new tasks while enhancing the utility of the large model. Two novel components are also included: Small Model Continual Fine-tuning is for preventing small models from temporal forgetting; One-by-One Distillation performs personalized fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, even when clients utilize heterogeneous small models.

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) with extremely low-bitwidth data have proven promising in efficient storage and computation on edge devices. To further reduce the accuracy drop while increasing speedup, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) becomes a popular solution. However, existing algorithms for exploring MPQ schemes are limited in flexibility and efficiency. Comprehending the complex impacts of different MPQ schemes on post-training quantization and quantization-aware training results is a challenge for conventional methods. Furthermore, an end-to-end framework for the optimization and deployment of MPQ models is missing in existing work.
  In this paper, we propose the MiCo framework, a holistic MPQ exploration and deployment framework for edge AI applications. The framework adopts a novel optimization algorithm to search for optimal quantization schemes with the highest accuracies while meeting latency constraints. Hardware-aware latency models are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations. After the exploration, the framework enables direct deployment from PyTorch MPQ models to bare-metal C codes, leading to end-to-end speedup with minimal accuracy drops.

<title>Causal Graph Profiling via Structural Divergence for Robust Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09504</link>

Abstract: With the growing complexity of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures such as water treatment networks, there is a pressing need for robust anomaly detection strategies that account for both system vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns. Traditional methods -- statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal" and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), catastrophic forgetting remains a substantial challenge, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information. Continual learning (CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning environments.

Abstract: Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future events in ongoing cases based on historical event logs. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data, existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable solution for next event prediction in PBPM.

<title>Decentralized Rank Scheduling for Energy-Constrained Multi-Task Federated Fine-Tuning in Edge-Assisted IoV Networks</title>

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for adapting foundation models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks in edge environments. In Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, enabling efficient and low-latency multi-task adaptation is particularly challenging due to client mobility, heterogeneous resources, and intermittent connectivity. This paper proposes a hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework that coordinates roadside units (RSUs) and vehicles to support resource-aware and mobility-resilient learning across dynamic IoV scenarios. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce a decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation mechanism formulated as a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. A novel UCB-DUAL algorithm is developed to enable adaptive exploration under per-task energy budgets, achieving provable sublinear regret. To evaluate our method, we construct a large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories, capturing dynamic participation, RSU handoffs, and communication variability. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off among all baselines, reducing latency by over 24\% and improving average accuracy by more than 2.5\%.

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data, especially for rare events, hinders training effective machine learning models. This paper proposes SYNAPSE-G (Synthetic Augmentation for Positive Sampling via Expansion on Graphs), a novel pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data for rare event classification, addressing the cold-start problem. This synthetic data serve as seeds for semi-supervised label propagation on a similarity graph constructed between the seeds and a large unlabeled dataset. This identifies candidate positive examples, subsequently labeled by an oracle (human or LLM). The expanded dataset then trains/fine-tunes a classifier. We theoretically analyze how the quality (validity and diversity) of the synthetic data impacts the precision and recall of our method. Experiments on the imbalanced SST2 and MHS datasets demonstrate SYNAPSE-G's effectiveness in finding positive labels, outperforming baselines including nearest neighbor search.

Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason, and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities, we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI. Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions. This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.

Abstract: Selective prediction [Dru13, QV19] models the scenario where a forecaster freely decides on the prediction window that their forecast spans. Many data statistics can be predicted to a non-trivial error rate without any distributional assumptions or expert advice, yet these results rely on that the forecaster may predict at any time. We introduce a model of Prediction with Limited Selectivity (PLS) where the forecaster can start the prediction only on a subset of the time horizon. We study the optimal prediction error both on an instance-by-instance basis and via an average-case analysis. We introduce a complexity measure that gives instance-dependent bounds on the optimal error. For a randomly-generated PLS instance, these bounds match with high probability.

Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for humans to explore the world, which can be modeled to enable an agent to efficiently explore the environment in reinforcement learning. Existing research indicates that establishing the causality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason how a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed exploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its intractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework for efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a measurement of causality in state space, \emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which represents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories. After that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points in discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous high-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where the agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded as our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and efficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that states with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC achieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately remains a cornerstone challenge in science and engineering, especially for problems involving complex geometries and limited labeled data. We introduce a Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator ($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed neural operator algorithms in the literature.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities: variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However, these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive performance and generalization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal Tracks is a Python-based statistical framework for analyzing protein thermal stability data that overcomes key limitations of existing thermal proteome profiling (TPP) work-flows. Unlike standard approaches that assume sigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions (limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses Gaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model any melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through kernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing proteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability, such as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses, where conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to their statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing proteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating proteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal thermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and is implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for proteome-wide thermal profiling studies.

Abstract: This paper investigates the asymmetric low-rank matrix completion problem, which can be formulated as an unconstrained non-convex optimization problem with a nonlinear least-squares objective function, and is solved via gradient descent methods. Previous gradient descent approaches typically incorporate regularization terms into the objective function to guarantee convergence. However, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis of the gradient flow both demonstrate that the elimination of regularization terms in gradient descent algorithms does not adversely affect convergence performance. By introducing the leave-one-out technique, we inductively prove that the vanilla gradient descent with spectral initialization achieves a linear convergence rate with high probability. Besides, we demonstrate that the balancing regularization term exhibits a small norm during iterations, which reveals the implicit regularization property of gradient descent. Empirical results show that our algorithm has a lower computational cost while maintaining comparable completion performance compared to other gradient descent algorithms.

Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for temporal anchoring in embedding spaces, modeled as drift maps interleaved with event-indexed blocks culminating in affine projections. We provide complete proofs for a variable-block contraction lemma (products of Lipschitz factors), a drift--projection convergence theorem with explicit uniform-gap envelopes, and ontological convergence under nested affine anchors with a robustness variant. We formalize an internal Manuscript Computer (MC) whose computations are defined purely by these operators and prove a rigorous finite-run equivalence theorem (with perturbation bounds). For attention layers, we give a self-contained proof that softmax is $1/2$-Lipschitz in $\ell_2$ and derive sufficient layer-contraction conditions (orthogonal/non-orthogonal heads). All floats are placed exactly where written; the manuscript uses only in-paper pseudocode and appendix figures.

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code will soon be publicly available.

Abstract: Brain connectomes, representing neural connectivity as graphs, are crucial for understanding brain organization but costly and time-consuming to acquire, motivating generative approaches. Recent advances in graph generative modeling offer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and reducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models face key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code (e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node attributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality; (iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight prediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive designs (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands, limiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric generative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG decomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing informative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite message-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while a dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to reconstruct the adjacency matrix. GTG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in self-supervised tasks and remains competitive in supervised settings, delivering higher structural fidelity and more precise weights with far less memory. Its modular design enables extensions to connectome super-resolution and cross-modality synthesis. Code: https://github.com/basiralab/GTG/

Abstract: Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource for understanding disease heterogeneity and to explore personalization of therapy. These datasets are derived from data not originally collected for research purposes and, as a result, are often incomplete and lack critical labels. Many AI tools have been developed to retrospectively label these datasets, such as by performing disease classification; however, they often suffer from limited interpretability. Previous work has attempted to explain predictions using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable concepts that map to higher-level clinical ideas, facilitating human evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations when the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. We use the identification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a challenging test case to demonstrate the value of incorporating contextual information from clinical notes to improve CBM performance. Our approach leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional concepts, resulting in a 10% performance gain over existing methods. Additionally, it facilitates the learning of more comprehensive concepts, thereby reducing the risk of information leakage and reliance on spurious shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS.

Abstract: In e-commerce advertising, selecting the most compelling combination of creative elements -- such as titles, images, and highlights -- is critical for capturing user attention and driving conversions. However, existing methods often evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the exponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative modeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage architecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse set of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with reinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine its selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a multi-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as clicks, to the individual creative elements. This allows the reward model to provide a more accurate feedback signal, which in turn guides the generative model toward creating more effective combinations. Deployed on a leading e-commerce platform, our approach has significantly increased advertising revenue, demonstrating its practical value. Additionally, we are releasing a large-scale industrial dataset to facilitate further research in this important domain.

<title>HKT: A Biologically Inspired Framework for Modular Hereditary Knowledge Transfer in Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: A prevailing trend in neural network research suggests that model performance improves with increasing depth and capacity - often at the cost of integrability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize small, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured knowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a biologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of task-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller child model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform imitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance mechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage process of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional carriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated components: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention (GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations, ensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision tasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10), and semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves child model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that HKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a general-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying high-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments.

<title>A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Biological Age and its Longitudinal Drivers</title>

Abstract: Predicting an individual's aging trajectory is a central challenge in preventative medicine and bioinformatics. While machine learning models can predict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the dynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed and validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal cohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We demonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has limited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by engineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope) of key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance. Our final LightGBM model, trained on the initial wave of data, successfully predicted age in the subsequent wave with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.515$ for males, $R^2 = 0.498$ for females), significantly outperforming both traditional linear models and other tree-based ensembles. SHAP analysis of our successful model revealed that the engineered slope features were among the most important predictors, highlighting that an individual's health trajectory, not just their static health snapshot, is a key determinant of biological age. Our framework paves the way for clinical tools that dynamically track patient health trajectories, enabling early intervention and personalized prevention strategies for age-related diseases.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest and adoption of LLMs, with $\mu$Transfer becoming a key technique for tuning hyperparameters in large-scale training. Meanwhile, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a leading architecture in extremely large models. However, the intersection of these two advancements has remained unexplored. In this work, we derive a $\mu$-Parameterization ($\mu$P) for MoE, providing theoretical guarantees for feature learning across model widths in both the router and experts. We empirically validate our parameterization and further investigate how scaling the number of experts and granularity affects the optimal learning rate.

Abstract: Electric load forecasting is pivotal for power system operation, planning and decision-making. The rise of smart grids and meters has provided more detailed and high-quality load data at multiple levels of granularity, from home to bus and cities. Motivated by similar patterns of loads across different cities in a province in eastern China, in this paper we focus on the Multi-Region Electric Load Forecasting (MRELF) problem, targeting accurate short-term load forecasting for multiple sub-regions within a large region. We identify three challenges for MRELF, including regional variation, contextual variation, and temporal variation. To address them, we propose TriForecaster, a new framework leveraging the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach within a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) paradigm to overcome these challenges. TriForecaster features RegionMixer and Context-Time Specializer (CTSpecializer) layers, enabling dynamic cooperation and specialization of expert models across regional, contextual, and temporal dimensions. Based on evaluation on four real-world MRELF datasets with varied granularity, TriForecaster outperforms state-of-the-art models by achieving an average forecast error reduction of 22.4\%, thereby demonstrating its flexibility and broad applicability. In particular, the deployment of TriForecaster on the eForecaster platform in eastern China exemplifies its practical utility, effectively providing city-level, short-term load forecasts for 17 cities, supporting a population exceeding 110 million and daily electricity usage over 100 gigawatt-hours.

Abstract: We present Proto-PINV+H, a fast training paradigm that combines closed-form weight computation with gradient-based optimisation of a small set of synthetic inputs, soft labels, and-crucially-hidden activations. At each iteration we recompute all weight matrices in closed form via two (or more) ridge-regularised pseudo-inverse solves, while updating only the prototypes with Adam. The trainable degrees of freedom are thus shifted from weight space to data/activation space. On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k train, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the official 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k trainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a multi-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable ridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the condition number of prototype matrices to generalisation. The approach yields favourable accuracy--speed--size trade-offs against ELM, random-feature ridge, and shallow MLPs trained by back-propagation.

Abstract: Gaussian processes are important models in the field of probabilistic numerics. We present a procedure for optimizing Mat\'ern kernel temporal Gaussian processes with respect to the kernel covariance function's hyperparameters. It is based on casting the optimization problem as a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for the parameters of an autoregressive model. We demonstrate that the proposed procedure outperforms maximizing the marginal likelihood as well as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, both in terms of runtime and ultimate root mean square error in Gaussian process regression.

Abstract: Biomechanical features have become important indicators for evaluating athletes' techniques. Traditionally, experts propose significant features and evaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human body and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the relationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With advancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods have gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we leverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical features from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships. The objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features contributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of these key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship between the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective distance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the model, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The findings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features, specific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the angle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key factor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater than 169{\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance. In contrast, for female athletes, the landing pose and approach step technique emerge as the most critical features influencing top 10% performances, alongside velocity. This study establishes a framework for analyzing the impact of various features on athletic performance, with a particular emphasis on top-performing events.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations. Recent studies suggest the presence of a latent task/function vector in LLMs during ICL. Merullo et al. (2024) showed that LLMs leverage this vector alongside the residual stream for Word2Vec-like vector arithmetic, solving factual-recall ICL tasks. Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward, we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded hierarchical concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic. We prove 0-1 loss convergence and show the strong generalization, including robustness to concept recombination and distribution shifts. These results elucidate the advantages of transformers over static embedding predecessors. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical insights.

Abstract: Preference learning has gained significant attention in tasks involving subjective human judgments, such as \emph{speech emotion recognition} (SER) and image aesthetic assessment. While pairwise frameworks such as RankNet offer robust modeling of relative preferences, they are inherently limited to local comparisons and struggle to capture global ranking consistency. To address these limitations, we propose RankList, a novel listwise preference learning framework that generalizes RankNet to structured list-level supervision. Our formulation explicitly models local and non-local ranking constraints within a probabilistic framework. The paper introduces a log-sum-exp approximation to improve training efficiency. We further extend RankList with skip-wise comparisons, enabling progressive exposure to complex list structures and enhancing global ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across diverse modalities. On benchmark SER datasets (MSP-Podcast, IEMOCAP, BIIC Podcast), RankList achieves consistent improvements in Kendall's Tau and ranking accuracy compared to standard listwise baselines. We also validate our approach on aesthetic image ranking using the Artistic Image Aesthetics dataset, highlighting its broad applicability. Through ablation and cross-domain studies, we show that RankList not only improves in-domain ranking but also generalizes better across datasets. Our framework offers a unified, extensible approach for modeling ordered preferences in subjective learning scenarios.

Abstract: To protect clients' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated unlearning aims to remove the data contribution of leaving clients from the global learned model. While current studies mainly focused on enhancing unlearning efficiency and effectiveness, the crucial aspects of efficiency fairness and performance fairness among decentralized clients during unlearning have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce FedShard, the first federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both efficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the challenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to quantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to satisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in terms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that FedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning attacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental results indicate that FedShard accelerates the data unlearning process 1.3-6.2 times faster than retraining from scratch and 4.9 times faster than the state-of-the-art exact unlearning methods.

<title>Beyond Scaling Law: A Data-Efficient Distillation Framework for Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities in tasks such as algorithmic coding and mathematical problem-solving. Recent methods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some methods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via only distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing computational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation framework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation. Inspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of reinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We identify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher model. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop a method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can enhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully curated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the student model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method through evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and code generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only 0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling. Our systematic analysis demonstrates that DED outperforms existing methods by considering factors beyond superficial hardness, token length, or teacher model capability. This work offers a practical and efficient pathway to advanced reasoning while preserving general capabilities.

<title>Modern Neural Networks for Small Tabular Datasets: The New Default for Field-Scale Digital Soil Mapping?</title>

Abstract: In the field of pedometrics, tabular machine learning is the predominant method for predicting soil properties from remote and proximal soil sensing data, forming a central component of digital soil mapping. At the field-scale, this predictive soil modeling (PSM) task is typically constrained by small training sample sizes and high feature-to-sample ratios in soil spectroscopy. Traditionally, these conditions have proven challenging for conventional deep learning methods. Classical machine learning algorithms, particularly tree-based models like Random Forest and linear models such as Partial Least Squares Regression, have long been the default choice for field-scale PSM. Recent advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) for tabular data challenge this view, yet their suitability for field-scale PSM has not been proven. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art ANN architectures, including the latest multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based models (TabM, RealMLP), attention-based transformer variants (FT-Transformer, ExcelFormer, T2G-Former, AMFormer), retrieval-augmented approaches (TabR, ModernNCA), and an in-context learning foundation model (TabPFN). Our evaluation encompasses 31 field- and farm-scale datasets containing 30 to 460 samples and three critical soil properties: soil organic matter or soil organic carbon, pH, and clay content. Our results reveal that modern ANNs consistently outperform classical methods on the majority of tasks, demonstrating that deep learning has matured sufficiently to overcome the long-standing dominance of classical machine learning for PSM. Notably, TabPFN delivers the strongest overall performance, showing robustness across varying conditions. We therefore recommend the adoption of modern ANNs for field-scale PSM and propose TabPFN as the new default choice in the toolkit of every pedometrician.

Abstract: Detecting whether any anomalies exist within a dataset is crucial for effective anomaly detection, yet it remains surprisingly underexplored in anomaly detection literature. This paper presents a comprehensive study that addresses the fundamental question: When can we conclusively determine that anomalies are present? Through extensive experimentation involving over three million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and algorithms, we identify a relationship between the dataset size, contamination rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant $ \alpha_{\text{algo}} $. Our results demonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate $ \nu $, the condition $ N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2} $ represents a lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence. This threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving their existence becomes infeasible.

Abstract: Forecasting in real-world settings requires models to integrate not only historical data but also relevant contextual information, often available in textual form. While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be effective context-aided forecasters via na\"ive direct prompting, their full potential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies, providing new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting. ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing us to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its forecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts with context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting pipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided forecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the largest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to estimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger models. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from the CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\"ive prompting across LLMs of different sizes and families. These results open the door to further simple yet effective improvements in LLM-based context-aided forecasting.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm, called Residual Reservoir Memory Networks (ResRMNs). ResRMN combines a linear memory reservoir with a non-linear reservoir, where the latter is based on residual orthogonal connections along the temporal dimension for enhanced long-term propagation of the input. The resulting reservoir state dynamics are studied through the lens of linear stability analysis, and we investigate diverse configurations for the temporal residual connections. The proposed approach is empirically assessed on time-series and pixel-level 1-D classification tasks. Our experimental results highlight the advantages of the proposed approach over other conventional RC models.

Abstract: The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision models, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications. Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time optimization at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however, do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved 4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.

<title>RadioMamba: Breaking the Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off in Radio Map Construction via a Hybrid Mamba-UNet</title>

Abstract: Radio map (RM) has recently attracted much attention since it can provide real-time and accurate spatial channel information for 6G services and applications. However, current deep learning-based methods for RM construction exhibit well known accuracy-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we introduce RadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture for RM construction to address the trade-off. Generally, accurate RM construction requires modeling long-range spatial dependencies, reflecting the global nature of wave propagation physics. RadioMamba utilizes a Mamba-Convolutional block where the Mamba branch captures these global dependencies with linear complexity, while a parallel convolutional branch extracts local features. This hybrid design generates feature representations that capture both global context and local detail. Experiments show that RadioMamba achieves higher accuracy than existing methods, including diffusion models, while operating nearly 20 times faster and using only 2.9\% of the model parameters. By improving both accuracy and efficiency, RadioMamba presents a viable approach for real-time intelligent optimization in next generation wireless systems.

Abstract: As 6G networks evolve into increasingly AI-driven, user-centric ecosystems, traditional reactive handover mechanisms demonstrate limitations, especially in mobile edge computing and autonomous agent-based service scenarios. This manuscript introduces WAAN, a cross-layer framework that enables intent-aware and proactive handovers by embedding lightweight TinyML agents as autonomous, negotiation-capable entities across heterogeneous edge nodes that contribute to intent propagation and network adaptation. To ensure continuity across mobility-induced disruptions, WAAN incorporates semi-stable rendezvous points that serve as coordination anchors for context transfer and state preservation. The framework's operational capabilities are demonstrated through a multimodal environmental control case study, highlighting its effectiveness in maintaining user experience under mobility. Finally, the article discusses key challenges and future opportunities associated with the deployment and evolution of WAAN.

Abstract: With the advent of 5G networks and technologies, ensuring the integrity and performance of packet core traffic is paramount. During network analysis, test files such as Packet Capture (PCAP) files and log files will contain errors if present in the system that must be resolved for better overall network performance, such as connectivity strength and handover quality. Current methods require numerous person-hours to sort out testing results and find the faults. This paper presents a novel AI/ML-driven Fault Analysis (FA) Engine designed to classify successful and faulty frames in PCAP files, specifically within the 5G packet core. The FA engine analyses network traffic using natural language processing techniques to identify anomalies and inefficiencies, significantly reducing the effort time required and increasing efficiency. The FA Engine also suggests steps to fix the issue using Generative AI via a Large Language Model (LLM) trained on several 5G packet core documents. The engine explains the details of the error from the domain perspective using documents such as the 3GPP standards and user documents regarding the internal conditions of the tests. Test results on the ML models show high classification accuracy on the test dataset when trained with 80-20 splits for the successful and failed PCAP files. Future scopes include extending the AI engine to incorporate 4G network traffic and other forms of network data, such as log text files and multimodal systems.

Abstract: Quantum computation has demonstrated a promising alternative to solving the NP-hard combinatorial problems. Specifically, when it comes to optimization, classical approaches become intractable to account for large-scale solutions. Specifically, we investigate quantum computing to solve the large-scale Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW). In this regard, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework augmented with a Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is designed to minimize the travel time in a realistic last-mile on-demand delivery. A novel problem-specific encoding quantum circuit with an entangling and variational layer is proposed. Moreover, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) are designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.

Abstract: Different CT segmentation datasets are typically obtained from different scanners under different capture settings and often provide segmentation labels for a limited and often disjoint set of organs. Using these heterogeneous data effectively while preserving patient privacy can be challenging. This work presents a novel federated learning approach to achieve universal segmentation across diverse abdominal CT datasets by utilizing model uncertainty for aggregation and predictive uncertainty for inference. Our approach leverages the inherent noise in stochastic mini-batch gradient descent to estimate a distribution over the model weights to provide an on-the-go uncertainty over the model parameters at the client level. The parameters are then aggregated at the server using the additional uncertainty information using a Bayesian-inspired inverse-variance aggregation scheme. Furthermore, the proposed method quantifies prediction uncertainty by propagating the uncertainty from the model weights, providing confidence measures essential for clinical decision-making. In line with recent work shown, predictive uncertainty is utilized in the inference stage to improve predictive performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in improving both the quality of federated aggregation and uncertainty-weighted inference compared to previously established baselines.

Abstract: The process of generating fully colorized drawings from sketches is a large, usually costly bottleneck in the manga and anime industry. In this study, we examine multiple models for image-to-image translation between anime characters and their sketches, including Neural Style Transfer, C-GAN, and CycleGAN. By assessing them qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that C-GAN is the most effective model that is able to produce high-quality and high-resolution images close to those created by humans.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance, narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures, highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

Abstract: Deep generative models open new avenues for simulating realistic genomic data while preserving privacy and addressing data accessibility constraints. While previous studies have primarily focused on generating gene expression or haplotype data, this study explores generating genotype data in both unconditioned and phenotype-conditioned settings, which is inherently more challenging due to the discrete nature of genotype data. In this work, we developed and evaluated commonly used generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and proposed adaptation tailored to discrete genotype data. We conducted extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including all chromosomes from cow and multiple chromosomes from human. Model performance was assessed using a well-established set of metrics drawn from both deep learning and quantitative genetics literature. Our results show that these models can effectively capture genetic patterns and preserve genotype-phenotype association. Our findings provide a comprehensive comparison of these models and offer practical guidelines for future research in genotype simulation. We have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/SihanXXX/DiscreteGenoGen.

Abstract: While analysing rare blood cell aggregates remains challenging in automated haematology, they could markedly advance label-free functional diagnostics. Conventional flow cytometers efficiently perform cell counting with leukocyte differentials but fail to identify aggregates with flagged results, requiring manual reviews. Quantitative phase imaging flow cytometry captures detailed aggregate morphologies, but clinical use is hampered by massive data storage and offline processing. Incorporating hidden biomarkers into routine haematology panels would significantly improve diagnostics without flagged results. We present RT-HAD, an end-to-end deep learning-based image and data processing framework for off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM), which combines physics-consistent holographic reconstruction and detection, representing each blood cell in a graph to recognize aggregates. RT-HAD processes >30 GB of image data on-the-fly with turnaround time of <1.5 min and error rate of 8.9% in platelet aggregate detection, which matches acceptable laboratory error rates of haematology biomarkers and solves the big data challenge for point-of-care diagnostics.

arXiv:2508.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key challenges to predict odor from molecular structure is unarguably our limited understanding of the odor space and the complexity of the underlying structure-odor relationships. Here, we show that the predictive performance of machine learning models for structure-based odor predictions can be improved using both, an expert and a data-driven odor taxonomy. The expert taxonomy is based on semantic and perceptual similarities, while the data-driven taxonomy is based on clustering co-occurrence patterns of odor descriptors directly from the prepared dataset. Both taxonomies improve the predictions of different machine learning models and outperform random groupings of descriptors that do not reflect existing relations between odor descriptors. We assess the quality of both taxonomies through their predictive performance across different odor classes and perform an in-depth error analysis highlighting the complexity of odor-structure relationships and identifying potential inconsistencies within the taxonomies by showcasing pear odorants used in perfumery. The data-driven taxonomy allows us to critically evaluate our expert taxonomy and better understand the molecular odor space. Both taxonomies as well as a full dataset are made available to the community, providing a stepping stone for a future community-driven exploration of the molecular basis of smell. In addition, we provide a detailed multi-layer expert taxonomy including a total of 777 different descriptors from the Pyrfume repository.

Abstract: Training a single model for multilingual, multi-task speech processing (MSP) is severely hampered by conflicting objectives between tasks like speech recognition and translation. While multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to align gradient updates, its effectiveness diminishes as the number of tasks grows, making it difficult to find a common descent direction. This raises a fundamental question: should highly conflicting objectives be optimized jointly or separated into a hierarchical structure? To address this question, this paper investigates three multi-objective MSP formulations, which we refer to as \textbf{objective soup recipes}. These formulations apply multi-objective optimization at different optimization levels to mitigate potential conflicts among all objectives. To ensure efficiency, we introduce a lightweight layer-selection mechanism that computes the conflict-avoiding gradient using only the most problematic layers, minimizing computational and memory overhead. Extensive experiments on CoVoST v2, LibriSpeech, and AISHELL-1 reveal that a bi-level recipe separating recognition and translation tasks consistently outperforms standard flat optimization. Our work demonstrates that hierarchical MOO is a more effective and scalable approach for building state-of-the-art MSP models. Our code has been released at https://github.com/afmsaif/Objective_Soups.

Abstract: This paper examines Modern Mercantilism, characterized by rising economic nationalism, strategic technological decoupling, and geopolitical fragmentation, as a disruptive shift from the post-1945 globalization paradigm. It applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to 768-dimensional SBERT-generated semantic embeddings of curated news articles to extract orthogonal latent factors that discriminate binary event outcomes linked to protectionism, technological sovereignty, and bloc realignments. Analysis of principal component loadings identifies key semantic features driving classification performance, enhancing interpretability and predictive accuracy. This methodology provides a scalable, data-driven framework for quantitatively tracking emergent mercantilist dynamics through high-dimensional text analytics

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/secure-ai-systems-group/adaptive-vision-and-language-navigation.

Abstract: Multimodal data analysis can lead to more accurate diagnoses of brain disorders due to the complementary information that each modality adds. However, a major challenge of using multimodal datasets in the neuroimaging field is incomplete data, where some of the modalities are missing for certain subjects. Hence, effective strategies are needed for completing the data. Traditional methods, such as subsampling or zero-filling, may reduce the accuracy of predictions or introduce unintended biases. In contrast, advanced methods such as generative models have emerged as promising solutions without these limitations. In this study, we proposed a generative adversarial network method designed to reconstruct missing modalities from existing ones while preserving the disease patterns. We used T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging and functional network connectivity as two modalities. Our findings showed a 9% improvement in the classification accuracy for Alzheimer's disease versus cognitive normal groups when using our generative imputation method compared to the traditional approaches.

<title>Value Function Initialization for Knowledge Transfer and Jump-start in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value function initialization (VFI) is an effective way to achieve a jumpstart in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging value estimates from prior tasks. While this approach is well established in tabular settings, extending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the continuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural networks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this work, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts value function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It employs a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred values into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's learned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach offers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on value estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining the strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their drawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and overall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer techniques.

Abstract: Advances in speech synthesis intensify security threats, motivating real-time deepfake detection research. We investigate whether bidirectional Mamba can serve as a competitive alternative to Self-Attention in detecting synthetic speech. Our solution, Fake-Mamba, integrates an XLSR front-end with bidirectional Mamba to capture both local and global artifacts. Our core innovation introduces three efficient encoders: TransBiMamba, ConBiMamba, and PN-BiMamba. Leveraging XLSR's rich linguistic representations, PN-BiMamba can effectively capture the subtle cues of synthetic speech. Evaluated on ASVspoof 21 LA, 21 DF, and In-The-Wild benchmarks, Fake-Mamba achieves 0.97%, 1.74%, and 5.85% EER, respectively, representing substantial relative gains over SOTA models XLSR-Conformer and XLSR-Mamba. The framework maintains real-time inference across utterance lengths, demonstrating strong generalization and practical viability. The code is available at https://github.com/xuanxixi/Fake-Mamba.

Abstract: This Innovative Practice full paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance the teaching of code refactoring in software engineering courses through real-time, context-aware feedback. Refactoring improves code quality but is difficult to teach, especially with complex, real-world codebases. Traditional methods like code reviews and static analysis tools offer limited, inconsistent feedback. Our approach integrates LLM-assisted refactoring into a course project using structured prompts to help students identify and address code smells such as long methods and low cohesion. Implemented in Spring 2025 in a long-lived OSS project, the intervention is evaluated through student feedback and planned analysis of code quality improvements. Findings suggest that LLMs can bridge theoretical and practical learning, supporting a deeper understanding of maintainability and refactoring principles.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net, a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network, features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

Abstract: Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN) classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the highest feature importance.

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges, including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work. In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA), measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic datasets.

<title>ProMode: A Speech Prosody Model Conditioned on Acoustic and Textual Inputs</title>

Abstract: Prosody conveys rich emotional and semantic information of the speech signal as well as individual idiosyncrasies. We propose a stand-alone model that maps text-to-prosodic features such as F0 and energy and can be used in downstream tasks such as TTS. The ProMode encoder takes as input acoustic features and time-aligned textual content, both are partially masked, and obtains a fixed-length latent prosodic embedding. The decoder predicts acoustics in the masked region using both the encoded prosody input and unmasked textual content. Trained on the GigaSpeech dataset, we compare our method with state-of-the-art style encoders. For F0 and energy predictions, we show consistent improvements for our model at different levels of granularity. We also integrate these predicted prosodic features into a TTS system and conduct perceptual tests, which show higher prosody preference compared to the baselines, demonstrating the model's potential in tasks where prosody modeling is important.

Abstract: Line graphs are an alternative representation of graphs where each vertex of the original (root) graph becomes an edge. However not all graphs have a corresponding root graph, hence the transformation from graphs to line graphs is not invertible. We investigate the case when there is a small perturbation in the space of line graphs, and try to recover the corresponding root graph, essentially defining the inverse of the line graph operation. We propose a linear integer program that edits the smallest number of edges in the line graph, that allow a root graph to be found. We use the spectral norm to theoretically prove that such a pseudo-inverse operation is well behaved. Illustrative empirical experiments on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our theoretical results work in practice.

<title>HyperKD: Distilling Cross-Spectral Knowledge in Masked Autoencoders via Inverse Domain Shift with Spatial-Aware Masking and Specialized Loss</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery. HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction, underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information, resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction, CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network (ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12, respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

<title>DeepWKB: Learning WKB Expansions of Invariant Distributions for Stochastic Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning method, called DeepWKB, for estimating the invariant distribution of randomly perturbed systems via its Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation $u_\epsilon(x) = Q(\epsilon)^{-1} Z_\epsilon(x) \exp\{-V(x)/\epsilon\}$, where $V$ is known as the quasi-potential, $\epsilon$ denotes the noise strength, and $Q(\epsilon)$ is the normalization factor. By utilizing both Monte Carlo data and the partial differential equations satisfied by $V$ and $Z_\epsilon$, the DeepWKB method computes $V$ and $Z_\epsilon$ separately. This enables an approximation of the invariant distribution in the singular regime where $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small, which remains a significant challenge for most existing methods. Moreover, the DeepWKB method is applicable to higher-dimensional stochastic systems whose deterministic counterparts admit non-trivial attractors. In particular, it provides a scalable and flexible alternative for computing the quasi-potential, which plays a key role in the analysis of rare events, metastability, and the stochastic stability of complex systems.

<title>Emergence of Hierarchies in Multi-Agent Self-Organizing Systems Pursuing a Joint Objective</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent self-organizing systems (MASOS) exhibit key characteristics including scalability, adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, which have contributed to their extensive application across various fields. However, the self-organizing nature of MASOS also introduces elements of unpredictability in their emergent behaviors. This paper focuses on the emergence of dependency hierarchies during task execution, aiming to understand how such hierarchies arise from agents' collective pursuit of the joint objective, how they evolve dynamically, and what factors govern their development. To investigate this phenomenon, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is employed to train MASOS for a collaborative box-pushing task. By calculating the gradients of each agent's actions in relation to the states of other agents, the inter-agent dependencies are quantified, and the emergence of hierarchies is analyzed through the aggregation of these dependencies. Our results demonstrate that hierarchies emerge dynamically as agents work towards a joint objective, with these hierarchies evolving in response to changing task requirements. Notably, these dependency hierarchies emerge organically in response to the shared objective, rather than being a consequence of pre-configured rules or parameters that can be fine-tuned to achieve specific results. Furthermore, the emergence of hierarchies is influenced by the task environment and network initialization conditions. Additionally, hierarchies in MASOS emerge from the dynamic interplay between agents' "Talent" and "Effort" within the "Environment." "Talent" determines an agent's initial influence on collective decision-making, while continuous "Effort" within the "Environment" enables agents to shift their roles and positions within the system.

<title>HierMoE: Accelerating MoE Training with Hierarchical Token Deduplication and Expert Swap</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09591</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformer has become a common architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to its sparsity, which requires fewer computational demands while easily scaling the model size. In MoE models, each MoE layer requires to dynamically choose tokens to activate particular experts for computation while the activated experts may not be located in the same device or GPU as the token. However, this leads to substantial communication and load imbalances across all GPUs, which obstructs the scalability of distributed systems within a GPU cluster. To this end, we introduce HierMoE to accelerate the training of MoE models by two topology-aware techniques: 1) token deduplication to reduce the communication traffic, and 2) expert swap to balance the workloads among all GPUs. To enable the above two proposed approaches to be more general, we build theoretical models aimed at achieving the best token duplication and expert swap strategy under different model configurations and hardware environments. We implement our prototype HierMoE system atop Megatron-LM and conduct experiments on a 32-GPU cluster with DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-30B-A3B models. Experimental results show that our HierMoE achieves $1.55\times$ to $3.32\times$ faster communication and delivers $1.18\times$ to $1.27\times$ faster end-to-end training compared to state-of-the-art MoE training systems, Tutel-2DH, SmartMoE, and Megatron-LM.

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database management systems, aiming to predict query results accurately without executing the queries. However, existing techniques either achieve low estimation accuracy or incur high inference latency. Simultaneously achieving high speed and accuracy becomes critical for the cardinality estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach called CoDe (Covering with Decompositions) to address this problem. CoDe employs the concept of covering design, which divides the table into multiple smaller, overlapping segments. For each segment, CoDe utilizes tensor decomposition to accurately model its data distribution. Moreover, CoDe introduces innovative algorithms to select the best-fitting distributions for each query, combining them to estimate the final result. By employing multiple models to approximate distributions, CoDe excels in effectively modeling discrete distributions and ensuring computational efficiency. Notably, experimental results show that our method represents a significant advancement in cardinality estimation, achieving state-of-the-art levels of both estimation accuracy and inference efficiency. Across various datasets, CoDe achieves absolute accuracy in estimating more than half of the queries.

Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots. The complete source code of the framework is publicly available at https://github.com/snt-arg/robot_suite.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) within the framework of probabilistic numerics offers a principled approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty arising from discretization. By leveraging Gaussian process regression and imposing the governing PDE as a constraint at a finite set of collocation points, probabilistic numerics delivers mesh-free solutions at arbitrary locations. However, the high computational cost, which scales cubically with the number of collocation points, remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale or high-dimensional problems. We propose a scalable enhancement to this paradigm through two key innovations. First, we develop a stochastic dual descent algorithm that reduces the per-iteration complexity from cubic to linear in the number of collocation points, enabling tractable inference. Second, we exploit a clustering-based active learning strategy that adaptively selects collocation points to maximize information gain while minimizing computational expense. Together, these contributions result in an $h$-adaptive probabilistic solver that can scale to a large number of collocation points. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solver on benchmark PDEs, including two- and three-dimensional steady-state elliptic problems, as well as a time-dependent parabolic PDE formulated in a space-time setting.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL) framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data, leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2, and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels. Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search ranking.

Abstract: Increasing diversity in language models is a challenging yet essential objective. A common approach is to raise the decoding temperature. In this work, we investigate this approach through a simplistic yet common case to provide insights into why decreasing temperature can improve quality (Precision), while increasing it often fails to boost coverage (Recall). Our analysis reveals that for a model to be effectively tunable through temperature adjustments, it must be trained toward coverage. To address this, we propose rethinking loss functions in language models by leveraging the Precision-Recall framework. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves a substantially better trade-off between Precision and Recall than merely combining negative log-likelihood training with temperature scaling. These findings offer a pathway toward more versatile and robust language modeling techniques.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) application providers rely on Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and roaming infrastructures to deliver their services globally. In this complex ecosystem, where the end-to-end communication path traverses multiple entities, it has become increasingly challenging to guarantee communication availability and reliability. Further, most platform operators use a reactive approach to communication issues, responding to user complaints only after incidents have become severe, compromising service quality. This paper presents our experience in the design and deployment of ANCHOR -- an unsupervised anomaly detection solution for the IoT connectivity service of a large global roaming platform. ANCHOR assists engineers by filtering vast amounts of data to identify potential problematic clients (i.e., those with connectivity issues affecting several of their IoT devices), enabling proactive issue resolution before the service is critically impacted. We first describe the IoT service, infrastructure, and network visibility of the IoT connectivity provider we operate. Second, we describe the main challenges and operational requirements for designing an unsupervised anomaly detection solution on this platform. Following these guidelines, we propose different statistical rules, and machine- and deep-learning models for IoT verticals anomaly detection based on passive signaling traffic. We describe the steps we followed working with the operational teams on the design and evaluation of our solution on the operational platform, and report an evaluation on operational IoT customers.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a rising trend in social-sensor cloud identity cloning incidents. However, existing approaches suffer from unsatisfactory performance, a lack of solutions for detecting duplicated accounts, and a lack of large-scale evaluations on real-world datasets. We introduce a novel method for detecting identity cloning in social-sensor cloud service providers. Our proposed technique consists of two primary components: 1) a similar identity detection method and 2) a cryptography-based authentication protocol. Initially, we developed a weakly supervised deep forest model to identify similar identities using non-privacy-sensitive user profile features provided by the service. Subsequently, we designed a cryptography-based authentication protocol to verify whether similar identities were generated by the same provider. Our extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility and superior performance of our technique compared to current state-of-the-art identity clone detection methods.

Abstract: This study investigates the implementation and efficacy of DeputyDev, an AI-powered code review assistant developed to address inefficiencies in the software development process. The process of code review is highly inefficient for several reasons, such as it being a time-consuming process, inconsistent feedback, and review quality not being at par most of the time. Using our telemetry data, we observed that at TATA 1mg, pull request (PR) processing exhibits significant inefficiencies, with average pick-up and review times of 73 and 82 hours, respectively, resulting in a 6.2 day closure cycle. The review cycle was marked by prolonged iterative communication between the reviewing and submitting parties. Research from the University of California, Irvine indicates that interruptions can lead to an average of 23 minutes of lost focus, critically affecting code quality and timely delivery. To address these challenges, we developed DeputyDev's PR review capabilities by providing automated, contextual code reviews. We conducted a rigorous double-controlled A/B experiment involving over 200 engineers to evaluate DeputyDev's impact on review times. The results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in both average per PR (23.09%) and average per-line-of-code (40.13%) review durations. After implementing safeguards to exclude outliers, DeputyDev has been effectively rolled out across the entire organisation. Additionally, it has been made available to external companies as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, currently supporting the daily work of numerous engineering professionals. This study explores the implementation and effectiveness of AI-assisted code reviews in improving development workflow timelines and code.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays, preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent, task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/NEURAL.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates. Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection. However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular, graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid diagnostics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/MMSN/.

<title>Structured Kernel Regression VAE: A Computationally Efficient Surrogate for GP-VAEs in ICA</title>

Abstract: The interpretability of generative models is considered a key factor in demonstrating their effectiveness and controllability. The generated data are believed to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable. Therefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or performing Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space helps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features affecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of generative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) combine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse process of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process. In some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for each dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each dimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different dimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs impose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource consumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different temporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions. Structuring the priors of latent variables via kernel functions-so that different kernel functions model the correlations among sequence points within different latent dimensions-is at the core of achieving disentanglement in VAEs. The proposed Structured Kernel Regression VAE (SKR-VAE) leverages this core idea in a more efficient way, avoiding the costly kernel matrix inversion required in GPs. This research demonstrates that, while maintaining ICA performance, SKR-VAE achieves greater computational efficiency and significantly reduced computational burden compared to GP-VAE.

Abstract: Large language models trained with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards tend to trade accuracy for length--inflating response lengths to achieve gains in accuracy. While longer answers may be warranted for harder problems, many tokens are merely "filler": repetitive, verbose text that makes no real progress. We introduce GFPO (Group Filtered Policy Optimization), which curbs this length explosion by sampling larger groups per problem during training and filtering responses to train on based on two key metrics: (1) response length and (2) token efficiency: reward per token ratio. By sampling more at training time, we teach models to think less at inference time. On the Phi-4-reasoning model, GFPO cuts GRPO's length inflation by 46-71% across challenging STEM and coding benchmarks (AIME 24/25, GPQA, Omni-MATH, LiveCodeBench) while maintaining accuracy. Optimizing for reward per token further increases reductions in length inflation to 71-85%. We also propose Adaptive Difficulty GFPO, which dynamically allocates more training resources to harder problems based on real-time difficulty estimates, improving the balance between computational efficiency and accuracy especially on difficult questions. GFPO demonstrates that increased training-time compute directly translates to reduced test-time compute--a simple yet effective trade-off for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, we can observe a significant increase of the phishing attacks in the Internet. In a typical phishing attack, the attacker sets up a malicious website that looks similar to the legitimate website in order to obtain the end-users' information. This may cause the leakage of the sensitive information and the financial loss for the end-users. To avoid such attacks, the early detection of these websites' URLs is vital and necessary. Previous researchers have proposed many machine learning algorithms to distinguish the phishing URLs from the legitimate ones. In this paper, we would like to enhance these machine learning algorithms from the perspective of feature selection. We propose a novel method to incorporate the keyword features with the traditional features. This method is applied on multiple traditional machine learning algorithms and the experimental results have shown this method is useful and effective. On average, this method can reduce the classification error by 30% for the large dataset. Moreover, its enhancement is more significant for the small dataset. In addition, this method extracts the information from the URL and does not rely on the additional information provided by the third-part service. The best result for the machine learning algorithm using our proposed method has achieved the accuracy of 99.68%.

<title>Improving the Speaker Anonymization Evaluation's Robustness to Target Speakers with Adversarial Learning</title>

Abstract: The current privacy evaluation for speaker anonymization often overestimates privacy when a same-gender target selection algorithm (TSA) is used, although this TSA leaks the speaker's gender and should hence be more vulnerable. We hypothesize that this occurs because the evaluation does not account for the fact that anonymized speech contains information from both the source and target speakers. To address this, we propose to add a target classifier that measures the influence of target speaker information in the evaluation, which can also be removed with adversarial learning. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is effective for multiple anonymizers, particularly when using a same-gender TSA, leading to a more reliable assessment.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the learned physical parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward pass across unseen datasets in testing.

<title>On the Generalization Limits of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks with Pure State Generators</title>

Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) in image generations tasks. Our analysis centers on fully quantum implementations of both the generator and discriminator. Through extensive numerical testing of current main architectures, we find that QGANs struggle to generalize across datasets, converging on merely the average representation of the training data. When the output of the generator is a pure-state, we analytically derive a lower bound for the discriminator quality given by the fidelity between the pure-state output of the generator and the target data distribution, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the limitations observed in current models. Our findings reveal fundamental challenges in the generalization capabilities of existing quantum generative models. While our analysis focuses on QGANs, the results carry broader implications for the performance of related quantum generative models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, ensuring their outputs align with human values and safety standards has become critical. The field has developed diverse alignment approaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction tuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each with distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified evaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these paradigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive evaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major alignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions: alignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and robustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment strategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying strengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing valuable insights for future research directions.

<title>Stable Diffusion Models are Secretly Good at Visual In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.

Abstract: The vocabulary used by language models (LM) - defined by the tokenizer - plays a key role in text generation quality. However, its impact remains under-explored in radiology. In this work, we address this gap by systematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on the task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We also investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed abstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific vocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models are trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance differences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve the most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory requirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences. These results demonstrate that adapting the vocabulary of LMs to the clinical domain provides practical benefits, including improved performance and reduced computational demands, making such models more accessible and effective for both research and real-world healthcare settings.

<title>Neural Bandit Based Optimal LLM Selection for a Pipeline of Tasks</title>

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety of tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict which out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft allow users to easily create custom LLM "assistants" specialized to particular types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask. For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary, and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms, this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus, unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs, creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks, even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM selection algorithms.

Abstract: The creation of human-like humanoid robots is hindered by a fundamental fragmentation: data processing and learning algorithms are rarely universal across different robot morphologies. This paper introduces the Generalized Behavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed to solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from human motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an adaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically retarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our novel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust, high-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire framework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac Lab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple configuration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training policies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent performance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first practical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid controllers.

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components: Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning, enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts. To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards. Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging storyboards than existing baselines.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has been utilized as a promising self-supervised learning approach to extract meaningful representations from unlabeled data. The majority of these methods take advantage of data-augmentation techniques to create diverse views from the original input. However, optimizing augmentations and their parameters for generating more effective views in contrastive learning frameworks is often resource-intensive and time-consuming. While several strategies have been proposed for automatically generating new views in computer vision, research in other domains, such as time-series biobehavioral data, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet powerful module for automatic view generation in contrastive learning frameworks applied to time-series biobehavioral data, which is essential for modern health care, termed learning views for time-series data (LEAVES). This proposed module employs adversarial training to learn augmentation hyperparameters within contrastive learning frameworks. We assess the efficacy of our method on multiple time-series datasets using two well-known contrastive learning frameworks, namely SimCLR and BYOL. Across four diverse biobehavioral datasets, LEAVES requires only approximately 20 learnable parameters -- dramatically fewer than the about 580k parameters demanded by frameworks like ViewMaker, a previously proposed adversarially trained convolutional module in contrastive learning, while achieving competitive and often superior performance to existing baseline methods. Crucially, these efficiency gains are obtained without extensive manual hyperparameter tuning, which makes LEAVES particularly suitable for large-scale or real-time healthcare applications that demand both accuracy and practicality.

Abstract: Efficient and sustainable power generation is a crucial concern in the energy sector. In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first parallel hybrid quantum-classical architecture deployed on a real-world power-plant dataset, illustrating how near-term quantum resources can already augment classical analytics in the energy sector.

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a widely used approach for optimization under uncertainty, where uncertain input parameters are modeled by random variables. Exact or approximation algorithms have been obtained for several fundamental problems in this area. However, a significant limitation of this approach is that it requires full knowledge of the underlying probability distributions. Can we still get good (approximation) algorithms if these distributions are unknown, and the algorithm needs to learn them through repeated interactions? In this paper, we resolve this question for a large class of ''monotone'' stochastic problems, by providing a generic online learning algorithm with $\sqrt{T\log(T)}$ regret relative to the best approximation algorithm (under known distributions). Importantly, our online algorithm works in a semi-bandit setting, where in each period, the algorithm only observes samples from the random variables that were actually probed. Moreover, our result extends to settings with censored and binary feedback, where the policy only observes truncated or thresholded versions of the probed variables. Our framework applies to several fundamental problems such as prophet inequality, Pandora's box, stochastic knapsack, single-resource revenue management and sequential posted pricing.

Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning aims to capture computations with neural networks by training models to imitate the execution of classical algorithms. While common architectures are expressive enough to contain the correct model in the weight space, current neural reasoners struggle to generalize well on out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, classical computations are not affected by distributional shifts as they can be described as transitions between discrete computational states. In this work, we propose to force neural reasoners to maintain the execution trajectory as a combination of finite predefined states. To achieve this, we separate discrete and continuous data flows and describe the interaction between them. Trained with supervision on the algorithm's state transitions, such models are able to perfectly align with the original algorithm. To show this, we evaluate our approach on multiple algorithmic problems and achieve perfect test scores both in single-task and multitask setups. Moreover, the proposed architectural choice allows us to prove the correctness of the learned algorithms for any test data.

Abstract: High-stakes applications rely on combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) and humans for responsive and reliable decision making. For example, content moderation in social media platforms often employs an AI-human pipeline to promptly remove policy violations without jeopardizing legitimate content. A typical heuristic estimates the risk of incoming content and uses fixed thresholds to decide whether to auto-delete the content (classification) and whether to send it for human review (admission). This approach can be inefficient as it disregards the uncertainty in AI's estimation, the time-varying element of content arrivals and human review capacity, and the selective sampling in the online dataset (humans only review content filtered by the AI).
  In this paper, we introduce a model to capture such an AI-human interplay. In this model, the AI observes contextual information for incoming jobs, makes classification and admission decisions, and schedules admitted jobs for human review. During these reviews, humans observe a job's true cost and may overturn an erroneous AI classification decision. These reviews also serve as new data to train the AI but are delayed due to congestion in the human review system. The objective is to minimize the costs of eventually misclassified jobs.
  We propose a near-optimal learning algorithm that carefully balances the classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss of non-reviewed jobs, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human review system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for online learning in contextual queueing systems. Moreover, numerical experiments based on online comment datasets show that our algorithm can substantially reduce the number of misclassifications compared to existing content moderation practice.

Abstract: M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions, a.k.a. gross substitute valuation functions, play a fundamental role in many fields, including discrete mathematics and economics. In practice, perfect knowledge of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions is often unavailable a priori, and we can optimize them only interactively based on some feedback. Motivated by such situations, we study online M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization problems, which are interactive versions of the problem studied by Murota and Shioura (1999). For the stochastic bandit setting, we present $O(T^{-1/2})$-simple regret and $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithms under $T$ times access to unbiased noisy value oracles of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions. A key to proving these results is the robustness of the greedy algorithm to local errors in M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization, which is one of our main technical results. While we obtain those positive results for the stochastic setting, another main result of our work is an impossibility in the adversarial setting. We prove that, even with full-information feedback, no algorithms that run in polynomial time per round can achieve $O(T^{1-c})$ regret for any constant $c > 0$. Our proof is based on a reduction from the matroid intersection problem for three matroids, which would be a novel approach to establishing the hardness in online learning.

Abstract: The growing demands on GPU memory posed by the increasing number of neural network parameters call for training approaches that are more memory-efficient. Previous memory reduction training techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and ReLoRA, face challenges, with LoRA being constrained by its low-rank structure, particularly during intensive tasks like pre-training, and ReLoRA suffering from saddle point issues. In this paper, we propose Sparse Spectral Training (SST) to optimize memory usage for pre-training. SST updates all singular values and selectively updates singular vectors through a multinomial sampling method weighted by the magnitude of the singular values. Furthermore, SST employs singular value decomposition to initialize and periodically reinitialize low-rank parameters, reducing distortion relative to full-rank training compared to other low-rank methods. Through comprehensive testing on both Euclidean and hyperbolic neural networks across various tasks, SST demonstrates its ability to outperform existing memory reduction training methods and is comparable to full-rank training in various cases. On LLaMA-1.3B, with only 18.7\% of the parameters trainable compared to full-rank training (using a rank equivalent to 6\% of the embedding dimension), SST reduces the perplexity gap between other low-rank methods and full-rank training by 97.4\%. This result highlights SST as an effective parameter-efficient technique for model pre-training.

Abstract: Multimodal Deep Learning enhances decision-making by integrating diverse information sources, such as texts, images, audio, and videos. To develop trustworthy multimodal approaches, it is essential to understand how uncertainty impacts these models. We propose LUMA, a unique multimodal dataset, featuring audio, image, and textual data from 50 classes, specifically designed for learning from uncertain data. It extends the well-known CIFAR 10/100 dataset with audio samples extracted from three audio corpora, and text data generated using the Gemma-7B Large Language Model (LLM). The LUMA dataset enables the controlled injection of varying types and degrees of uncertainty to achieve and tailor specific experiments and benchmarking initiatives. LUMA is also available as a Python package including the functions for generating multiple variants of the dataset with controlling the diversity of the data, the amount of noise for each modality, and adding out-of-distribution samples. A baseline pre-trained model is also provided alongside three uncertainty quantification methods: Monte-Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensemble, and Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning. This comprehensive dataset and its tools are intended to promote and support the development, evaluation, and benchmarking of trustworthy and robust multimodal deep learning approaches. We anticipate that the LUMA dataset will help the research community to design more trustworthy and robust machine learning approaches for safety critical applications.

Abstract: Time series data is a key element of big data analytics, commonly found in domains such as finance, healthcare, climate forecasting, and transportation. In large scale real world settings, such data is often high dimensional and multivariate, requiring advanced forecasting methods that are both accurate and interpretable. Although Transformer based models perform well in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), their lack of explainability limits their use in critical applications. To overcome this, we propose Distributed Lag Transformer (DLFormer), a novel Transformer architecture for explainable and scalable MTSF. DLFormer integrates a distributed lag embedding and a time variable aware learning (TVAL) mechanism to structurally model both local and global temporal dependencies and explicitly capture the influence of past variables on future outcomes. Experiments on ten benchmark and real world datasets show that DLFormer achieves state of the art predictive accuracy while offering robust, interpretable insights into variable wise and temporal dynamics. These results highlight ability of DLFormer to bridge the gap between performance and explainability, making it highly suitable for practical big data forecasting tasks.

Abstract: The Smart Grid (SG) is a critical energy infrastructure that collects real-time electricity usage data to forecast future energy demands using information and communication technologies (ICT). Due to growing concerns about data security and privacy in SGs, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising training framework. FL offers a balance between privacy, efficiency, and accuracy in SGs by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data from IoT devices. In this survey, we thoroughly review recent advancements in designing FL-based SG systems across three stages: generation, transmission and distribution, and consumption. Additionally, we explore potential vulnerabilities that may arise when implementing FL in these stages. Furthermore, we discuss the gap between state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL research and its practical applications in SGs, and we propose future research directions. Unlike traditional surveys addressing security issues in centralized machine learning methods for SG systems, this survey is the first to specifically examine the applications and security concerns unique to FL-based SG systems. We also introduce FedGridShield, an open-source framework featuring implementations of SOTA attack and defense methods. Our aim is to inspire further research into applications and improvements in the robustness of FL-based SG systems.

Abstract: Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events requires analysis of precipitation fields with high resolution (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical coverage (to capture sufficient examples of rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide precipitation fields at 1 km resolution but with limited historical and geographical coverage, while gauge-based records and reanalysis products cover decades of time on a global scale, but only at 30-50 km resolution. To help provide high-resolution precipitation estimates over long time scales, this study presents Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a diffusion framework to downscale (super-resolve) precipitation fields from low-resolution gauge and reanalysis products. Crucially, unlike related deep generative models, WassDiff integrates a Wasserstein distribution-matching regularizer to the denoising process to reduce empirical biases at extreme intensities. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff quantitatively outperforms existing state-of-the-art generative downscaling methods at recovering extreme weather phenomena such as tropical storms and cold fronts. Case studies further qualitatively demonstrate WassDiff's ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale weather structures and accurate peak intensities. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.

Abstract: Differentiable optimization has attracted significant research interest, particularly for quadratic programming (QP). Existing approaches for differentiating the solution of a QP with respect to its defining parameters often rely on specific integrated solvers. This integration limits their applicability, including their use in neural network architectures and bi-level optimization tasks, restricting users to a narrow selection of solver choices. To address this limitation, we introduce dQP, a modular and solver-agnostic framework for plug-and-play differentiation of virtually any QP solver. Our key theoretical insight is that the solution and its derivative can each be expressed in terms of closely-related and simple linear systems by using the active set at the solution. This insight enables efficient decoupling of the QP's solution, obtained by any solver, from its differentiation. Our open-source, minimal-overhead implementation will be made publicly available and seamlessly integrates with more than 15 state-of-the-art solvers. Comprehensive benchmark experiments demonstrate dQP's robustness and scalability, particularly highlighting its advantages in large-scale sparse problems.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable creative prowess and emergence capabilities. Existing empirical studies have revealed a strong connection between these LLMs' impressive emergence abilities and their in-context learning (ICL) capacity, allowing them to solve new tasks using only task-specific prompts without further fine-tuning. On the other hand, existing empirical and theoretical studies also show that there is a linear regularity of the multi-concept encoded semantic representation behind transformer-based LLMs. However, existing theoretical work fail to build up an understanding of the connection between this regularity and the innovative power of ICL. Additionally, prior work often focuses on simplified, unrealistic scenarios involving linear transformers or unrealistic loss functions, and they achieve only linear or sub-linear convergence rates. In contrast, this work provides a fine-grained mathematical analysis to show how transformers leverage the multi-concept semantics of words to enable powerful ICL and excellent out-of-distribution ICL abilities, offering insights into how transformers innovate solutions for certain unseen tasks encoded with multiple cross-concept semantics. Inspired by empirical studies on the linear latent geometry of LLMs, the analysis is based on a concept-based low-noise sparse coding prompt model. Leveraging advanced techniques, this work showcases the exponential 0-1 loss convergence over the highly non-convex training dynamics, which pioneeringly incorporates the challenges of softmax self-attention, ReLU-activated MLPs, and cross-entropy loss. Empirical simulations corroborate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: We consider the approximation of functions by 2-layer neural networks with a small number of hidden weights based on the squared loss and small datasets. Due to the highly non-convex energy landscape, gradient-based training often suffers from local minima. As a remedy, we initialize the hidden weights with samples from a learned proposal distribution, which we parameterize as a deep generative model. To train this model, we exploit the fact that with fixed hidden weights, the optimal output weights solve a linear equation. After learning the generative model, we refine the sampled weights with a gradient-based post-processing in the latent space. Here, we also include a regularization scheme to counteract potential noise. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerical examples.

<title>Scalable Out-of-distribution Robustness in the Presence of Unobserved Confounders</title>

Abstract: We consider the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where the distribution shift is due to an unobserved confounder ($Z$) affecting both the covariates ($X$) and the labels ($Y$). This confounding introduces heterogeneity in the predictor, i.e., $P(Y | X) = E_{P(Z | X)}[P(Y | X,Z)]$, making traditional covariate and label shift assumptions unsuitable. OOD generalization differs from traditional domain adaptation in that it does not assume access to the covariate distribution ($X^\text{te}$) of the test samples during training. These conditions create a challenging scenario for OOD robustness: (a) $Z^\text{tr}$ is an unobserved confounder during training, (b) $P^\text{te}(Z) \neq P^\text{tr}(Z)$, (c) $X^\text{te}$ is unavailable during training, and (d) the predictive distribution depends on $P^\text{te}(Z)$. While prior work has developed complex predictors requiring multiple additional variables for identifiability of the latent distribution, we explore a set of identifiability assumptions that yield a surprisingly simple predictor using only a single additional variable. Our approach demonstrates superior empirical performance on several benchmark tasks.

Abstract: We develop the framework of Indirect Query Bayesian Optimization (IQBO), a new class of Bayesian optimization problems where the integrated feedback is given via a conditional expectation of the unknown function $f$ to be optimized. The underlying conditional distribution can be unknown and learned from data. The goal is to find the global optimum of $f$ by adaptively querying and observing in the space transformed by the conditional distribution. This is motivated by real-world applications where one cannot access direct feedback due to privacy, hardware or computational constraints. We propose the Conditional Max-Value Entropy Search (CMES) acquisition function to address this novel setting, and propose a hierarchical search algorithm with multi-resolution feedback to improve computational efficiency. We show regret bounds for our proposed methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on simulated optimization tasks.

Abstract: Cellular traffic forecasting is a critical task that enables network operators to efficiently allocate resources and address anomalies in rapidly evolving environments. The exponential growth of data collected from base stations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these large datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of their predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two bio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing through Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The evaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency. These models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to analyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems. Additionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three diverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results indicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to traditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested to evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to centralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired models for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques in multi-view settings face significant challenges, particularly when integrating heterogeneous data, aligning feature spaces, and managing view-specific biases. These issues are prominent in neuroscience, where data from multiple subjects exposed to the same stimuli are analyzed to uncover brain activity dynamics. In magnetoencephalography (MEG), where signals are captured at the scalp level, estimating the brain's underlying sources is crucial, especially in group studies where sources are assumed to be similar for all subjects. Common methods, such as Multi-View Independent Component Analysis (MVICA), assume identical sources across subjects, but this assumption is often too restrictive due to individual variability and age-related changes. Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays (MVICAD) addresses this by allowing sources to differ up to a temporal delay. However, temporal dilation effects, particularly in auditory stimuli, are common in brain dynamics, making the estimation of time delays alone insufficient. To address this, we propose Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays and Dilations (MVICAD2), which allows sources to differ across subjects in both temporal delays and dilations. We present a model with identifiable sources, derive an approximation of its likelihood in closed form, and use regularization and optimization techniques to enhance performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that MVICAD2 outperforms existing multi-view ICA methods. We further validate its effectiveness using the Cam-CAN dataset, and showing how delays and dilations are related to aging.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) controls the prediction uncertainty of classification systems by producing a small prediction set, ensuring a predetermined probability that the true class lies within this set. This is commonly done by defining a score, based on the model predictions, and setting a threshold on this score using a validation set. In this study, we address the problem of CP calibration when we only have access to a calibration set with noisy labels. We show how we can estimate the noise-free conformal threshold based on the noisy labeled data. We derive a finite sample coverage guarantee for uniform noise that remains effective even in tasks with a large number of classes. We dub our approach Noise-Aware Conformal Prediction (NACP). We illustrate the performance of the proposed results on several standard image classification datasets with a large number of classes.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Language Models has driven demand for effective model compression techniques to reduce memory and computation costs. Low-rank pruning has gained attention for its GPU compatibility across all densities. However, low-rank pruning struggles to match the performance of semi-structured pruning, often doubling perplexity at similar densities. In this paper, we propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank representation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank representation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies pivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear combinations, achieving 24.2% additional memory savings and 24.6% faster inference over low-rank layers at rank = 50% of dimension. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel, retraining-free reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M). MPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly outperforms existing low-rank pruning methods, and achieves performance comparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency and compatibility. Our code is available at https://github.com/biomedical-cybernetics/pivoting-factorization.

Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks enable powerful long-range sequence modeling with constant memory usage and time-per-token during inference. These architectures hold promise for streaming applications at the edge, but deployment in resource-constrained environments requires hardware-aware optimizations to minimize latency and energy consumption. Unstructured sparsity offers a compelling solution, enabling substantial reductions in compute and memory requirements--when accelerated by compatible hardware platforms. In this paper, we conduct a scaling study to investigate the Pareto front of performance and efficiency across inference compute budgets. We find that highly sparse linear RNNs consistently achieve better efficiency-performance trade-offs than dense baselines, with 2x less compute and 36% less memory at iso-accuracy. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-time streaming task for audio denoising. By quantizing our sparse models to fixed-point arithmetic and deploying them on the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip for real-time processing, we translate model compression into tangible gains of 42x lower latency and 149x lower energy consumption compared to a dense model on an edge GPU. Our findings showcase the transformative potential of unstructured sparsity, paving the way for highly efficient recurrent neural networks in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: We propose "LEAPS", an algorithm to sample from discrete distributions known up to normalization by learning a rate matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). LEAPS can be seen as a continuous-time formulation of annealed importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods, extended so that the variance of the importance weights is offset by the inclusion of the CTMC. To derive these importance weights, we introduce a set of Radon-Nikodym derivatives of CTMCs over their path measures. Because the computation of these weights is intractable with standard neural network parameterizations of rate matrices, we devise a new compact representation for rate matrices via what we call "locally equivariant" functions. To parameterize them, we introduce a family of locally equivariant multilayer perceptrons, attention layers, and convolutional networks, and provide an approach to make deep networks that preserve the local equivariance. This property allows us to propose a scalable training algorithm for the rate matrix such that the variance of the importance weights associated to the CTMC are minimal. We demonstrate the efficacy of LEAPS on problems in statistical physics.

Abstract: Learned denoisers play a fundamental role in various signal generation (e.g., diffusion models) and reconstruction (e.g., compressed sensing) architectures, whose success derives from their ability to leverage low-dimensional structure in data. Existing denoising methods, however, either rely on local approximations that require a linear scan of the entire dataset or treat denoising as generic function approximation problems, often sacrificing efficiency and interpretability. We consider the problem of efficiently denoising a new noisy data point sampled from an unknown $d$-dimensional manifold $M \in \mathbb{R}^D$, using only noisy samples. This work proposes a framework for test-time efficient manifold denoising, by framing the concept of "learning-to-denoise" as "learning-to-optimize". We have two technical innovations: (i) online learning methods which learn to optimize over the manifold of clean signals using only noisy data, effectively "growing" an optimizer one sample at a time. (ii) mixed-order methods which guarantee that the learned optimizers achieve global optimality, ensuring both efficiency and near-optimal denoising performance. We corroborate these claims with theoretical analyses of both the complexity and denoising performance of mixed-order traversal. Our experiments on scientific manifolds demonstrate significantly improved complexity-performance tradeoffs compared to nearest neighbor search, which underpins existing provable denoising approaches based on exhaustive search.

Abstract: Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on "emergent misalignment" and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment.

Abstract: We propose a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method that mitigates the rigidity of fixed reward structures and the limited flexibility of implicit reward regularization. Building on the Maximum Entropy IRL framework, our approach incorporates a squared temporal-difference (TD) regularizer with adaptive targets that evolve dynamically during training, thereby imposing adaptive bounds on recovered rewards and promoting robust decision-making. To capture richer return information, we integrate distributional RL into the learning process. Empirically, our method achieves expert-level performance on complex MuJoCo tasks, surpassing baseline methods on the Humanoid task with 3 demonstrations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the approach and provide insights into reward dynamics in imitation learning.

Abstract: We provide a general framework for learning diffusion bridges that transport prior to target distributions. It includes existing diffusion models for generative modeling, but also underdamped versions with degenerate diffusion matrices, where the noise only acts in certain dimensions. Extending previous findings, our framework allows to rigorously show that score matching in the underdamped case is indeed equivalent to maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood. Motivated by superior convergence properties and compatibility with sophisticated numerical integration schemes of underdamped stochastic processes, we propose \emph{underdamped diffusion bridges}, where a general density evolution is learned rather than prescribed by a fixed noising process. We apply our method to the challenging task of sampling from unnormalized densities without access to samples from the target distribution. Across a diverse range of sampling problems, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, notably outperforming alternative methods, while requiring significantly fewer discretization steps and no hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) by applying steering vectors to modify model activations in forward passes. We compute 8 steering vectors, each corresponding to a different social bias axis, such as age, gender, or race, on a training subset of the BBQ dataset and compare the effectiveness of these to 3 additional bias mitigation methods across 4 datasets. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.8% on BBQ, 8.3% on CLEAR-Bias, and 1% on StereoSet, and show improvements over prompting and Self-Debias in all cases, and improvements over fine-tuning in 12 out of 17 evaluations. In addition, steering vectors showed the lowest impact on MMLU scores of the four bias mitigation methods tested. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that they are a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.

Abstract: Extensive compute and memory requirements limit the deployment of large language models (LLMs) on any hardware. Compression methods, such as pruning, can reduce model size, which in turn reduces resource requirements. State-of-the-art pruning is based on coarse-grained methods. They are time-consuming and inherently remove critical model parameters, adversely impacting the quality of the pruned model. This paper introduces projection pruning, a novel fine-grained method for pruning LLMs. In addition, LLM projection pruning is enhanced by a new approach we refer to as composite projection pruning - the synergistic combination of unstructured pruning that retains accuracy and structured pruning that reduces model size. We develop Mosaic, a novel system to create and deploy pruned LLMs using composite projection pruning. Mosaic is evaluated using a range of performance and quality metrics on multiple hardware platforms, LLMs, and datasets. Mosaic is 7.19x faster in producing models than existing approaches. Mosaic models achieve up to 84.2% lower perplexity and 31.4% higher accuracy than models obtained from coarse-grained pruning. Up to 67% faster inference and 68% lower GPU memory use is noted for Mosaic models. Mosaic is available for public use from https://github.com/blessonvar/Mosaic

Abstract: Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios. These inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial modality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating fundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these coupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting simultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in multimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving cross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we achieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism that guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we introduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations. Extensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior performance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving $f$-divergences, yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or inadequately overlapping supports -- the density-chasm and the support-chasm problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We design $\textbf{D}^3\textbf{RE}$, a unified framework for \textbf{robust}, \textbf{stable} and \textbf{efficient} density ratio estimation. We propose the dequantified diffusion bridge interpolant (DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the proposed dequantified Schr{\"o}dinger bridge interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of machine-learning models that operate on graph-structured data. Their expressive power is intimately related to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. To prove our main result, we develop a new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size. In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a halting recurrent GNN.

Abstract: One explanation for the strong generalization ability of neural networks is implicit bias. Yet, the definition and mechanism of implicit bias in non-linear contexts remains little understood. In this work, we propose to characterize implicit bias by the count of connected regions in the input space with the same predicted label. Compared with parameter-dependent metrics (e.g., norm or normalized margin), region count can be better adapted to nonlinear, overparameterized models, because it is determined by the function mapping and is invariant to reparametrization. Empirically, we found that small region counts align with geometrically simple decision boundaries and correlate well with good generalization performance. We also observe that good hyper-parameter choices such as larger learning rates and smaller batch sizes can induce small region counts. We further establish the theoretical connections and explain how larger learning rate can induce small region counts in neural networks.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) facilitate collaborative optimal decision making without centralized coordination, thus enabling a wide range of applications in practice. To date, however, most theoretical convergence studies for existing actor-critic decentralized MARL methods are limited to the guarantee of a stationary solution under the linear function approximation. This leaves a significant gap between the highly successful use of deep neural actor-critic for decentralized MARL in practice and the current theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a deep neural actor-critic method for decentralized MARL, where both the actor and critic components are inherently non-linear. We show that our proposed method enjoys a global optimality guarantee with a finite-time convergence rate of O(1/T), where T is the total iteration times. This marks the first global convergence result for deep neural actor-critic methods in the MARL literature. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments, which verify our theoretical results.

<title>Gradual Transition from Bellman Optimality Operator to Bellman Operator in Online Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement, which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC, significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to hyperparameters related to optimality. The code for this study is available at https://github.com/motokiomura/annealed-q-learning.

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers. Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the interdependence of prediction tasks.

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used for interpretable machine learning due to their clearly structured reasoning process. However, this structure belies a challenge we refer to as predictive equivalence: a given tree's decision boundary can be represented by many different decision trees. The presence of models with identical decision boundaries but different evaluation processes makes model selection challenging. The models will have different variable importance and behave differently in the presence of missing values, but most optimization procedures will arbitrarily choose one such model to return. We present a boolean logical representation of decision trees that does not exhibit predictive equivalence and is faithful to the underlying decision boundary. We apply our representation to several downstream machine learning tasks. Using our representation, we show that decision trees are surprisingly robust to test-time missingness of feature values; we address predictive equivalence's impact on quantifying variable importance; and we present an algorithm to optimize the cost of reaching predictions.

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning. We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of scale and feature learning in continual learning.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way, and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate scores, where $K>0$ is an arbitrary fixed integer. This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE. More broadly, our work develops a theoretical framework towards understanding the efficacy of high-order methods for accelerated sampling.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components. First, we introduce (i) Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an (ii) Audio-Guided Attention module that models the interactions between target candidates and mentioned objects, enhancing discrimination in cluttered 3D environments. To support benchmarking, we (iii) synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods, highlight the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) is widely used to address the exploration/exploitation tradeoff in contextual bandits, yet recent theory shows that it does not explore aggressively enough in high-dimensional problems. Feel-Good Thompson Sampling (FG-TS) addresses this by adding an optimism bonus that biases toward high-reward models, and it achieves the asymptotically minimax-optimal regret in the linear setting when posteriors are exact. However, its performance with \emph{approximate} posteriors -- common in large-scale or neural problems -- has not been benchmarked. We provide the first systematic study of FG-TS and its smoothed variant (SFG-TS) across eleven real-world and synthetic benchmarks. To evaluate their robustness, we compare performance across settings with exact posteriors (linear and logistic bandits) to approximate regimes produced by fast but coarse stochastic-gradient samplers. Ablations over preconditioning, bonus scale, and prior strength reveal a trade-off: larger bonuses help when posterior samples are accurate, but hurt when sampling noise dominates. FG-TS generally outperforms vanilla TS in linear and logistic bandits, but tends to be weaker in neural bandits. Nevertheless, because FG-TS and its variants are competitive and easy-to-use, we recommend them as baselines in modern contextual-bandit benchmarks. Finally, we provide source code for all our experiments in https://github.com/SarahLiaw/ctx-bandits-mcmc-showdown.

Abstract: While naturalistic driving studies have become foundational for providing real-world driver behaviour data, the existing frameworks for identifying risk based on such data have two fundamental limitations: (i) they rely on predefined time windows and fixed thresholds to disentangle risky and normal episodes of driving behaviour, and (ii) they assume stationary behavioural distribution across drivers and trips. These limitations have hindered the ability of the existing frameworks to capture behavioural nuances, adapt to individual variability, or respond to stochastic fluctuations in driving contexts. Thus, there is a need for a unified framework that jointly adapts risk labels and model learning to per-driver behavioural dynamics, a gap this study aims to bridge. We present an adaptive and personalised risk detection framework, built on Belgian naturalistic driving data, integrating a rolling time window with bi-level optimisation and dynamically calibrating both model hyperparameters and driver-specific risk thresholds at the same time. The framework was tested using two safety indicators, speed-weighted time headway and harsh driving events, and three models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Speed-weighted time headway yielded more stable and context-sensitive classifications than harsh-event counts. XGBoost maintained consistent performance under changing thresholds, while the DNN excelled in early-risk detection at lower thresholds but exhibited higher variability. The ensemble calibration integrates model-specific thresholds and confidence scores into a unified risk decision, balancing sensitivity and stability. Overall, the framework demonstrates the potential of adaptive and personalised risk detection to enhance real-time safety feedback and support driver-specific interventions within intelligent transport systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss. We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains, fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore, we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios, often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive gains in utility.

<title>From Model Performance to Claim: How a Change of Focus in Machine Learning Replicability Can Help Bridge the Responsibility Gap</title>

Abstract: Two goals - improving replicability and accountability of Machine Learning research respectively, have accrued much attention from the AI ethics and the Machine Learning community. Despite sharing the measures of improving transparency, the two goals are discussed in different registers - replicability registers with scientific reasoning whereas accountability registers with ethical reasoning. Given the existing challenge of the Responsibility Gap - holding Machine Learning scientists accountable for Machine Learning harms due to them being far from sites of application, this paper posits that reconceptualizing replicability can help bridge the gap. Through a shift from model performance replicability to claim replicability, Machine Learning scientists can be held accountable for producing non-replicable claims that are prone to eliciting harm due to misuse and misinterpretation. In this paper, I make the following contributions. First, I define and distinguish two forms of replicability for ML research that can aid constructive conversations around replicability. Second, I formulate an argument for claim-replicability's advantage over model performance replicability in justifying assigning accountability to Machine Learning scientists for producing non-replicable claims and show how it enacts a sense of responsibility that is actionable. In addition, I characterize the implementation of claim replicability as more of a social project than a technical one by discussing its competing epistemological principles, practical implications on Circulating Reference, Interpretative Labor, and research communication.

Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.

<title>PrAViC: Probabilistic Adaptation Framework for Real-Time Video Classification</title>

Abstract: Video processing is generally divided into two main categories: processing of the entire video, which typically yields optimal classification outcomes, and real-time processing, where the objective is to make a decision as promptly as possible. Although the models dedicated to the processing of entire videos are typically well-defined and clearly presented in the literature, this is not the case for online processing, where a~plethora of hand-devised methods exist. To address this issue, we present PrAViC, a novel, unified, and theoretically-based adaptation framework for tackling the online classification problem in video data. The initial phase of our study is to establish a mathematical background for the classification of sequential data, with the potential to make a decision at an early stage. This allows us to construct a natural function that encourages the model to return a result much faster. The subsequent phase is to present a straightforward and readily implementable method for adapting offline models to the online setting using recurrent operations. Finally, PrAViC is evaluated by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art offline and online models and datasets. This enables the network to significantly reduce the time required to reach classification decisions while maintaining, or even enhancing, accuracy.

<title>Continuous-time q-Learning for Jump-Diffusion Models under Tsallis Entropy</title>

arXiv:2407.03888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time reinforcement learning in jump-diffusion models by featuring the q-learning (the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning) under Tsallis entropy regularization. Contrary to the Shannon entropy, the general form of Tsallis entropy renders the optimal policy not necessarily a Gibbs measure. Herein, the Lagrange multiplier and KKT condition are needed to ensure that the learned policy is a probability density function. As a consequence, the characterization of the optimal policy using the q-function also involves a Lagrange multiplier. In response, we establish the martingale characterization of the q-function and devise two q-learning algorithms depending on whether the Lagrange multiplier can be derived explicitly or not. In the latter case, we consider different parameterizations of the optimal q-function and the optimal policy, and update them alternatively in an Actor-Critic manner. We also study two numerical examples, namely, an optimal liquidation problem in dark pools and a non-LQ control problem. It is interesting to see therein that the optimal policies under the Tsallis entropy regularization can be characterized explicitly, which are distributions concentrated on some compact support. The satisfactory performance of our q-learning algorithms is illustrated in each example.

Abstract: Language models with billions of parameters exhibit in-context learning abilities, enabling few-shot learning on tasks that the model was not specifically trained for. Traditional models achieve breakthrough performance on language tasks, but do not perform well on basic reasoning benchmarks. However, a new in-context learning approach, Chain-of-thought, has demonstrated strong multi-step reasoning abilities on these benchmarks.
  The research on LLM reasoning abilities started with the question whether LLMs can solve grade school math word problems, and has expanded to other tasks in the past few years. This paper reviews the field of multi-step reasoning with LLMs. We propose a taxonomy that identifies different ways to generate, evaluate, and control multi-step reasoning. We provide an in-depth coverage of core approaches and open problems, and we propose a research agenda for the near future.
  We find that multi-step reasoning approaches have progressed beyond math word problems, and can now successfully solve challenges in logic, combinatorial games, and robotics, sometimes by first generating code that is then executed by external tools. Many studies in multi-step methods are using reinforcement learning for finetuning, external optimization loops, in context reinforcement learning, and self-reflection.

Abstract: In order to sample from an unnormalized probability density function, we propose to combine continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with rejection-resampling steps based on importance weights. We relate the iterative training of CNFs with regularized velocity fields to a JKO scheme and prove convergence of the involved velocity fields to the velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The alternation of local flow steps and non-local rejection-resampling steps allows to overcome local minima or slow convergence of the WGF for multimodal distributions. Since the proposal of the rejection step is generated by the model itself, they do not suffer from common drawbacks of classical rejection schemes. The arising model can be trained iteratively, reduces the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss function in each step, allows to generate iid samples and moreover allows for evaluations of the generated underlying density. Numerical examples show that our method yields accurate results on various test distributions including high-dimensional multimodal targets and outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases significantly.

Abstract: We present a dynamic hedging scheme for S&amp;P 500 options, where rebalancing decisions are enhanced by integrating information about the implied volatility surface dynamics. The optimal hedging strategy is obtained through a deep policy gradient-type reinforcement learning algorithm. The favorable inclusion of forward-looking information embedded in the volatility surface allows our procedure to outperform several conventional benchmarks such as practitioner and smiled-implied delta hedging procedures, both in simulation and backtesting experiments. The outperformance is more pronounced in the presence of transaction costs.

Abstract: Detecting vulnerabilities is vital for software security, yet deep learning-based vulnerability detectors (DLVD) face a data shortage, which limits their effectiveness. Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.

<title>On the Robustness of Kernel Goodness-of-Fit Tests</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05854</link>

arXiv:2408.05854v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goodness-of-fit testing is often criticized for its lack of practical relevance: since ``all models are wrong'', the null hypothesis that the data conform to our model is ultimately always rejected as the sample size grows. Despite this, probabilistic models are still used extensively, raising the more pertinent question of whether the model is \emph{good enough} for the task at hand. This question can be formalized as a robust goodness-of-fit testing problem by asking whether the data were generated from a distribution that is a mild perturbation of the model. In this paper, we show that existing kernel goodness-of-fit tests are not robust under common notions of robustness including both qualitative and quantitative robustness. We further show that robustification techniques using tilted kernels, while effective in the parameter estimation literature, are not sufficient to ensure both types of robustness in the testing setting. To address this, we propose the first robust kernel goodness-of-fit test, which resolves this open problem by using kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) balls. This framework encompasses many well-known perturbation models, such as Huber's contamination and density-band models.

Abstract: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is hard, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build on well-established components to construct a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in "stone" weights.

Abstract: Neural networks have continued to gain prevalence in the modern era for their ability to model complex data through pattern recognition and behavior remodeling. However, the static construction of traditional neural networks inhibits dynamic intelligence. This makes them inflexible to temporal changes in data and unfit to capture complex dependencies. With the advent of quantum technology, there has been significant progress in creating quantum algorithms. In recent years, researchers have developed quantum neural networks that leverage the capabilities of qubits to outperform classical networks. However, their current formulation exhibits a static construction limiting the system's dynamic intelligence. To address these weaknesses, we develop a Liquid Quantum Neural Network (LQNet) and a Continuous Time Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (CTRQNet). Both models demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing quantum neural networks (QNNs), achieving accuracy increases as high as 40\% on CIFAR 10 through binary classification. We propose LQNets and CTRQNets might shine a light on quantum machine learning's black box.

Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We tested our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we modeled the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach. The proposed graph-informed penalty can be easily integrated with other symbolic regression algorithms, enhancing model interpretability and performance by incorporating network structure into the regression process.

Abstract: Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code. Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved. To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews. Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation. Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture. However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training. This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback. To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality. Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function. Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour. Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated. The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models.

<title>A spectral method for multi-view subspace learning using the product of projections</title>

arXiv:2410.19125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-view data provides complementary information on the same set of observations, with multi-omics and multimodal sensor data being common examples. Analyzing such data typically requires distinguishing between shared (joint) and unique (individual) signal subspaces from noisy, high-dimensional measurements. Despite many proposed methods, the conditions for reliably identifying joint and individual subspaces remain unclear. We rigorously quantify these conditions, which depend on the ratio of the signal rank to the ambient dimension, principal angles between true subspaces, and noise levels. Our approach characterizes how spectrum perturbations of the product of projection matrices, derived from each view's estimated subspaces, affect subspace separation. Using these insights, we provide an easy-to-use and scalable estimation algorithm. In particular, we employ rotational bootstrap and random matrix theory to partition the observed spectrum into joint, individual, and noise subspaces. Diagnostic plots visualize this partitioning, providing practical and interpretable insights into the estimation performance. In simulations, our method estimates joint and individual subspaces more accurately than existing approaches. Applications to multi-omics data from colorectal cancer patients and nutrigenomic study of mice demonstrate improved performance in downstream predictive tasks.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, which can be further augmented by integrating a pre-trained vision model into the original LLM to create a multimodal LLM (MLLM). However, this integration often significantly decreases performance on natural language understanding and generation tasks, compared to the original LLM. This study investigates this issue using the LLaVA MLLM, treating the integration as a continual learning problem. We evaluate five continual learning methods to mitigate forgetting and identify a technique that enhances visual understanding while minimizing linguistic performance loss. Our approach reduces linguistic performance degradation by up to 15% over the LLaVA recipe, while maintaining high multimodal accuracy. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method through continual learning on a sequence of vision-language tasks, effectively preserving linguistic skills while acquiring new multimodal capabilities.

arXiv:2412.03012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the whole-body loco-manipulation problem using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on the problem of how to coordinate the floating base and the robotic arm of a wheeled-quadrupedal manipulator robot to achieve direct six-dimensional (6D) end-effector (EE) pose tracking in task space. Different from conventional whole-body loco-manipulation problems that track both floating-base and end-effector commands, the direct EE pose tracking problem requires inherent balance among redundant degrees of freedom in the whole-body motion. We leverage RL to solve this challenging problem. To address the associated difficulties, we develop a novel reward fusion module (RFM) that systematically integrates reward terms corresponding to different tasks in a nonlinear manner. In such a way, the inherent multi-stage and hierarchical feature of the loco-manipulation problem can be carefully accommodated. By combining the proposed RFM with the a teacher-student RL training paradigm, we present a complete RL scheme to achieve 6D EE pose tracking for the wheeled-quadruped manipulator robot. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the significance of the RFM. In particular, we enable smooth and precise tracking performance, achieving state-of-the-art tracking position error of less than 5 cm, and rotation error of less than 0.1 rad.

Abstract: From a simple text prompt, generative-AI image models can create stunningly realistic and creative images bounded, it seems, by only our imagination. These models have achieved this remarkable feat thanks, in part, to the ingestion of billions of images collected from nearly every corner of the internet. Many creators have understandably expressed concern over how their intellectual property has been ingested without their permission or a mechanism to opt out of training. As a result, questions of fair use and copyright infringement have quickly emerged. We describe a method that allows us to determine if a model was trained on a specific image or set of images. This method is computationally efficient and assumes no explicit knowledge of the model architecture or weights (so-called black-box membership inference). We anticipate that this method will be crucial for auditing existing models and, looking ahead, ensuring the fairer development and deployment of generative AI models.

Abstract: Real-world audio is often degraded by numerous factors. This work presents an audio restoration model tailored for high-res music at 44.1kHz. Our model, Audio-to-Audio Schr\"odinger Bridges (A2SB), is capable of both bandwidth extension (predicting high-frequency components) and inpainting (re-generating missing segments). Critically, A2SB is end-to-end requiring no vocoder to predict waveform outputs, able to restore hour-long audio inputs, and trained on permissively licensed music data. A2SB is capable of achieving state-of-the-art band-width extension and inpainting quality on several out-of-distribution music test sets.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on the KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio of up to 400$\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV for multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods and achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the verification of quantized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where some fixed-width arithmetic is used to represent numbers. We introduce the linear-constrained validity (LVP) problem for verifying GNNs properties, and provide an efficient translation from LVP instances into a logical language. We show that LVP is in PSPACE, for any reasonable activation functions. We provide a proof system. We also prove PSPACE-hardness, indicating that while reasoning about quantized GNNs is feasible, it remains generally computationally challenging.

<title>Generative Active Adaptation for Drifting and Imbalanced Network Intrusion Detection</title>

Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in network intrusion detection systems, yet its performance often degrades due to concept drift and imbalanced data. These challenges are compounded by the labor-intensive process of labeling network traffic, especially when dealing with evolving and rare attack types, which makes preparing the right data for adaptation difficult. To address these issues, we propose a generative active adaptation framework that minimizes labeling effort while enhancing model robustness. Our approach employs density-aware dataset prior selection to identify the most informative samples for annotation, and leverages deep generative models to conditionally synthesize diverse samples, thereby augmenting the training set and mitigating the effects of concept drift. We evaluate our end-to-end framework \NetGuard on both simulated IDS data and a real-world ISP dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in intrusion detection performance. Our method boosts the overall F1-score from 0.60 (without adaptation) to 0.86. Rare attacks such as Infiltration, Web Attack, and FTP-BruteForce, which originally achieved F1 scores of 0.001, 0.04, and 0.00, improve to 0.30, 0.50, and 0.71, respectively, with generative active adaptation in the CIC-IDS 2018 dataset. Our framework effectively enhances rare attack detection while reducing labeling costs, making it a scalable and practical solution for intrusion detection.

Abstract: Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.

<title>FT-Transformer: Resilient and Reliable Transformer with End-to-End Fault Tolerant Attention</title>

Abstract: Transformer models rely on High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources for inference, where soft errors are inevitable in large-scale systems, making the reliability of the model particularly critical. Existing fault tolerance frameworks for Transformers are designed at the operation level without architectural optimization, leading to significant computational and memory overhead, which in turn reduces protection efficiency and limits scalability to larger models. In this paper, we implement module-level protection for Transformers by treating the operations within the attention module as a single kernel and applying end-to-end fault tolerance. This method provides unified protection across multi-step computations, while achieving comprehensive coverage of potential errors in the nonlinear computations. For linear modules, we design a strided algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) that avoids inter-thread communication. Experimental results show that our end-to-end fault tolerance achieves up to 7.56x speedup over traditional methods with an average fault tolerance overhead of 13.9%.

Abstract: AI-generated text is proliferating across domains, from creative writing and journalism to marketing content and scientific articles. Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that most of the competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) foundation models have been an area ripe for exploration with their improved performance in various medical tasks. Despite the rapid advances, there exists a fundamental limitation: Processing unseen medical codes out of the vocabulary. This problem limits the generality of EHR foundation models and the integration of models trained with different vocabularies. To deal with this problem, we propose MedRep for EHR foundation models based on the observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM), providing the integrated medical concept representations and the basic data augmentation strategy for patient trajectories. For concept representation learning, we enrich the information of each concept with a minimal definition through large language model (LLM) prompts and enhance the text-based representations through graph ontology of OMOP vocabulary. Trajectory augmentation randomly replaces selected concepts with other similar concepts that have closely related representations to let the model practice with the concepts out-of-vocabulary. Finally, we demonstrate that EHR foundation models trained with MedRep better maintain the prediction performance in external datasets. Our code implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/kicarussays/MedRep.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.

<title>Towards Safer Pretraining: Analyzing and Filtering Harmful Content in Webscale datasets for Responsible LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4, and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for harmful content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. We share TTP, TTP-Eval, HAVOC and a sample of C4 inferenced on HarmFormer. Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

Abstract: Trajectory optimization is a cornerstone of modern robot autonomy, enabling systems to compute trajectories and controls in real-time while respecting safety and physical constraints. However, it has seen limited usage in spaceflight applications due to its heavy computational demands that exceed the capability of most flight computers. In this work, we provide results on the first flight demonstration of using machine learning-based warm starts for accelerating trajectory optimization for the Astrobee free-flying robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved for by sequential convex programming (SCP). On-board, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%. This work represents a significant milestone in the use of learning-based control for spaceflight applications and a stepping stone for future advances in the use of machine learning for autonomous guidance, navigation, & control.

Abstract: We propose a novel method, termed the M-learner, for estimating heterogeneous indirect and total treatment effects and identifying relevant subgroups within a mediation framework. The procedure comprises four key steps. First, we compute individual-level conditional average indirect/total treatment effect Second, we construct a distance matrix based on pairwise differences. Third, we apply tSNE to project this matrix into a low-dimensional Euclidean space, followed by K-means clustering to identify subgroup structures. Finally, we calibrate and refine the clusters using a threshold-based procedure to determine the optimal configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach specifically designed to capture treatment effect heterogeneity in the presence of mediation. Experimental results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Application to the real-world Jobs II dataset highlights the broad adaptability and potential applicability of our method.Code is available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/M-learner-C4BB.

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare.

arXiv:2506.02260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of digital health technologies has led to the generation of complex multi-modal data, such as physical activity measurements simultaneously collected from various sensors of mobile and wearable devices. These data hold immense potential for advancing health studies, but current methods predominantly rely on supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled datasets that are often expensive or impractical to obtain, especially in clinical studies. To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder (MoCA) that leverages cross-modality masking and the Transformer autoencoder architecture to utilize both temporal correlations within modalities and cross-modal correlations between data streams. We also provide theoretical guarantees to support the effectiveness of the cross-modality masking scheme in MoCA. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both reconstruction and downstream tasks. We release open-source code for data processing, pre-training, and downstream tasks in the supplementary materials. This work highlights the transformative potential of self-supervised learning in digital health and multi-modal data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online recommendation services.

<title>MGDFIS: Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy for Small Object Detection</title>

arXiv:2506.12697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

arXiv:2506.13265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

arXiv:2506.17857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions, and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary, AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable, structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face growing vulnerability to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. While developers invest heavily in alignment finetuning and safety guardrails, researchers continue publishing novel attacks, driving progress through adversarial iteration. This dynamic mirrors a strategic game of continual evolution. However, two major challenges hinder jailbreak development: the high cost of querying top-tier LLMs and the short lifespan of effective attacks due to frequent safety updates. These factors limit cost-efficiency and practical impact of research in jailbreak attacks. To address this, we propose MetaCipher, a low-cost, multi-agent jailbreak framework that generalizes across LLMs with varying safety measures. Using reinforcement learning, MetaCipher is modular and adaptive, supporting extensibility to future strategies. Within as few as 10 queries, MetaCipher achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent malicious prompt benchmarks, outperforming prior jailbreak methods. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation across diverse victim models and benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability. Warning: This paper contains model outputs that may be offensive or harmful, shown solely to demonstrate jailbreak efficacy.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking and GLM-4.5V, a family of vision-language models (VLMs) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V.

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.

<title>Efficient Visual Appearance Optimization by Learning from Prior Preferences</title>

Abstract: Adjusting visual parameters such as brightness and contrast is common in our everyday experiences. Finding the optimal parameter setting is challenging due to the large search space and the lack of an explicit objective function, leaving users to rely solely on their implicit preferences. Prior work has explored Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) to address this challenge, involving users to iteratively select preferred designs from candidate sets. However, PBO often requires many rounds of preference comparisons, making it more suitable for designers than everyday end-users. We propose Meta-PO, a novel method that integrates PBO with meta-learning to improve sample efficiency. Specifically, Meta-PO infers prior users' preferences and stores them as models, which are leveraged to intelligently suggest design candidates for the new users, enabling faster convergence and more personalized results. An experimental evaluation of our method for appearance design tasks on 2D and 3D content showed that participants achieved satisfactory appearance in 5.86 iterations using Meta-PO when participants shared similar goals with a population (e.g., tuning for a ``warm'' look) and in 8 iterations even generalizes across divergent goals (e.g., from ``vintage'', ``warm'', to ``holiday''). Meta-PO makes personalized visual optimization more applicable to end-users through a generalizable, more efficient optimization conditioned on preferences, with the potential to scale interface personalization more broadly.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.

<title>Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control: Non-Penalty Approach</title>

Abstract: In [1], the distributed linear-quadratic problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ) are formulated into a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem with affine constraints. Moreover, a penalty approach is considered in [1], and the PALM (proximal alternating linearized minimization) algorithm is studied with convergence and complexity analysis. In this paper, we aim to address the inherent drawbacks of the penalty approach, such as the challenge of tuning the penalty parameter and the risk of introducing spurious stationary points. Specifically, we first reformulate the SF-LQ problem and the DFT-LQ problem from an epi-composition function perspective, aiming to solve constrained problem directly. Then, from a theoretical viewpoint, we revisit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and establish its convergence to the set of cluster points under certain assumptions. When these assumptions do not hold, we show that alternative approaches combining subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation methods can be effectively utilized. In summary, our results enable the direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex surrogates, restrictive structural assumptions or penalty formulations that incorporate constraints into the cost function.

Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming strong baselines.

Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural representations to the internal representations learned by computational models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example, simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis. In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for neuroscience more generally.

<title>Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens</title>

arXiv:2508.01191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

<div> land patents, large language models, georeferencing, Virginia, historical

Summary:
Large language models were evaluated for converting historical land patent descriptions into geographically accurate coordinates in Virginia. A corpus of 5,471 patent abstracts from 1695-1732 was analyzed, with a benchmark of 43 test cases. The top-performing LLM achieved a mean error of 23 km, outperforming other LLMs and external baselines. A five-call ensemble reduced errors further to 19 km at low cost. Redacting patentee names increased errors, indicating reliance on textual descriptions. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained a 28 km error with a strong cost-accuracy benchmark. External geocoding tools did not offer significant benefits. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs) in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43 rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class, and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3, and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km (median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70% (Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12 km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Summary:<br />
Hat-DFed is a novel framework for Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in Edge Computing (EC) systems. It addresses challenges related to dynamic topology changes, resource heterogeneity, and data heterogeneity in the learning process. The framework formulates topology construction as a dual optimization problem to maximize model performance and minimize energy consumption. A two-phase algorithm is designed to construct optimal communication topologies and estimate their impact on performance and energy cost. Additionally, an importance-aware model aggregation mechanism is integrated to mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity on model performance. Hat-DFed aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of DFL in complex edge environments, providing a comprehensive solution for collaborative training of AI models while ensuring data privacy and minimizing communication bottlenecks. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers, decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, has been extensively explored in the research community. Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions. Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring, yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity, nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for spatially distributed time series prediction.

Summary:<br />
Deep learning has shown immense potential in various fields, but suffers from performance degradation when faced with domain shifts. The proposed MoSSDA framework tackles this issue in multivariate time-series classification by incorporating a two-step momentum encoder-utilized approach. This framework utilizes a domain-invariant encoder to extract features from both the source and target domains, followed by a positive contrastive module powered by an online momentum encoder. By leveraging the learned features without data augmentation, MoSSDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse datasets with different backbones and various unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The efficacy of each module, including two-stage learning, has been validated through an ablation study. The MoSSDA code is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields; however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue, assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework, MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust, domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains. Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a new method, Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC), to improve cellular traffic prediction in the telecom industry. It addresses the challenges of sporadic and bursty traffic patterns by segmenting data into chunks and utilizing coarse-grained temporal attention for trend reference and fine-grained spatial attention for detailed correlations. This approach leverages the complementarity of multi-grained spatial-temporal features to enhance prediction accuracy. Furthermore, an online learning strategy is implemented to detect concept drift in real-time and adjust parameters accordingly. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MGSTC over eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.്<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation. Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios. Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new theoretical framework that interprets the core computation of attention in Transformer architectures as Pavlovian conditioning. It presents a mathematical model that simplifies the analysis of attention's associative process by mapping queries, keys, and values to classical conditioning elements. The framework suggests that attention operations form transient associative memories through Hebbian rules, with CS-US pairs creating dynamic associations for later retrieval. The article also presents theoretical insights: a capacity theorem indicating that attention heads can store a certain number of associations before interference occurs, an error propagation analysis highlighting architectural trade-offs for reliability, and a discussion of how biologically plausible learning rules could improve Transformer architectures. This novel framework implies that the success of AI may be attributed to implementing computational principles derived from millions of years of biological evolution. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and (3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone, but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over millions of years of evolution.

<div> Keywords: neural networks, hyperspectral imaging, generative model, physics-based, uncertainty quantification

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach to hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification using a physics-conditioned generative model. The model, based on a probabilistic latent-variable framework, learns the distribution of HSI radiance measurements and predicts the emissivity spectrum. By incorporating information about the HSI scene's atmosphere and background, the model provides context for accurate encoding and decoding processes. To ensure unbiased results and encourage physically consistent mappings, an in-the-loop augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria are employed. Monte-Carlo sampling enables uncertainty quantification and produces interpretable emissivity distributions. Furthermore, a material matching scheme returns likely material matches based on inferred emissivity distributions. This approach enables the incorporation of contextual information, captures variations in material spectra, and provides interpretable probability measures for candidate materials based on remotely-sensed radiance measurements. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Summary: 
The study compares DARC and DAMP architectures in recurrent convolutional networks. DAMP, incorporating a gated MLP for channel mixing, outperformed DARC in generalization performance on Re-ARC benchmark for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks. Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in {\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1) spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation; and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance, the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification. Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver less satisfactory results.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel framework, HSA-Net, to address the over-smoothing problem in Graph Neural Networks for molecular representation learning. The framework consists of two modules: Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) and Source-Aware Fusion (SAF). HAP dynamically switches between cross-attention and Graph-Mamba projectors for different graph layers, preserving global topological information and fine-grained details. SAF module then merges these multi-level features, selecting fusion experts based on aggregation features. Experimental results show that HSA-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, providing high-quality, multi-level features for downstream tasks like molecular captioning and property prediction. <div>
arXiv:2508.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem, where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network (HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Summary:
In this study, the authors introduce SHeRL-FL, a novel approach that integrates split learning and hierarchical model aggregation for efficient and scalable federated learning. By allowing edge clients and servers to compute training objectives independently, SHeRL-FL reduces coordination complexity and communication overhead significantly. Experimental results using various datasets and models demonstrate that SHeRL-FL outperforms centralized FL, HierFL, and SplitFed in terms of reduced data transmission by over 90% and improved hierarchical split learning methods. The proposed method shows promise in addressing computational heterogeneity issues in large-scale networks and reducing the training burden on resource-limited devices. <div>
arXiv:2508.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL (HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical split learning methods.

<div> Keywords: all-or-nothing clause evaluation, fuzzy-pattern Tsetlin Machine, pattern matching, online learning, high accuracy

Summary:
The paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM), a novel variant that utilizes a fuzzy clause evaluation strategy. This approach allows clauses to contribute to the overall vote even if some literals fail, leading to more flexible and robust pattern matching. FPTM achieves high accuracy with significantly fewer clauses than standard Tsetlin Machines, reducing memory requirements and training time. On the IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, while training up to 316x faster compared to existing models. On Fashion-MNIST, FPTM demonstrates accuracy improvement with a reduced number of clauses, outperforming the Composite TM. Moreover, FPTM excels on the Amazon Sales dataset with noise, surpassing the Graph Tsetlin Machine and a Graph Convolutional Neural Network in accuracy. The proposed fuzzy mechanism enables efficient online learning on microcontrollers, with inference throughput reaching 34.5 million predictions/second. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input, enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a 50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB, enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5 million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches 92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy, significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

<div> Entropic Optimal Transport, Attention mechanism, Gradient computation, Information geometry, Fisher Information Matrix <br />
<br />Summary: The article provides a theoretical justification for the scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism used in deep learning. It shows that the attention forward pass solves a degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, maximizing similarity while being maximally entropic. This leads to a specific information geometry on the space of attention distributions, characterized by the Fisher Information Matrix. The backward pass, computed via backpropagation, is mathematically equivalent to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule from reinforcement learning. This unified view reveals SDPA as a principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update. <div>

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient, revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

<div> linear bandits, online regret minimization, offline data, regret bounds, optimal design

Summary:<br />
The article discusses online regret minimization in linear bandits with access to prior observations (offline data). A new algorithm called Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE) is introduced, which incorporates offline data to reduce online regret significantly compared to existing methods. The algorithm utilizes an extended D-optimal design within exploration phases, achieving an online regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. The effective problem dimension $\deff \leq d$, influenced by the quality of offline data, plays a crucial role in determining regret bounds. Lower bounds on minimax regret explicitly depend on the quality of offline data, demonstrating the optimality of the algorithm in well-explored or poorly explored data scenarios. A Frank-Wolfe approximation further refines the regret term to $O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, particularly beneficial in high-dimensional settings with moderate quality of offline data. <div>
arXiv:2508.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model. There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently, this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm, Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the \emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff \approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff = o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to $O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff = \Omega(1)$.

Summary: 
Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that utilizes 2D matrix-form hidden states instead of conventional vector-form hidden states. These networks have dynamically changing synaptic weights, known as fast weights, that act as short-term memory storage. Another network, called the programmer, controls the modifications of these fast weights based on input observations. FWPs have connections to transformers and state space models in terms of computational characteristics. Furthermore, there are links between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence. This primer provides a technical overview of FWPs, discussing their foundations, computational properties, and connections to various models in the field of machine learning and neural networks. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces DCCD-CONF, a framework for learning nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. It addresses limitations of existing methods by alternating between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder distribution through maximum log-likelihood. The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in causal graph recovery and confounder identification, as demonstrated on both synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets. Consistency guarantees are provided to support the theoretical soundness of the approach. <div>
arXiv:2508.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Summary:
Nodes in real-world datasets are often part of heterogeneous graphs with diverse features. Node classification on such graphs is crucial for various applications. While Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) work well, their predictions lack transparency. Current explanation methods struggle with realistic features beyond node type. In response, DiGNNExplainer is proposed, using discrete denoising diffusion to create realistic features. By generating discrete features in a discrete space, DiGNNExplainer offers better explanations compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Partial Optimal Transport, Machine Learning, Sparsity, Quadratic Regularization, Color Transfer
Summary: 
The paper introduces Quadratic Regularized Partial Optimal Transport (QPOT) as an alternative to existing entropic solvers for Partial Optimal Transport (POT). QPOT allows for sparsity in the transport plan, making it more suitable for applications that require sparse solutions. Experiments on synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world tasks like color transfer and domain adaptation, show that QPOT outperforms existing methods in terms of sparsity and performance. This novel formulation of POT with quadratic regularization offers greater flexibility by accommodating unbalanced input measures and can be beneficial for various machine learning applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures. Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans, hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of utilizing heterogeneous compute resources for neural network training, which is often optimized for homogeneous parallel computing. The authors propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local SGD) method that allocates workloads based on compute capacity, allowing for efficient use of diverse resources. By intentionally introducing bias into data sampling and model aggregation, the method accelerates training on slower components like CPUs. The study demonstrates that controlled bias in local SGD can achieve comparable or higher accuracy than synchronous SGD with data parallelism in heterogeneous environments. This parallelization strategy is applicable to various setups, including cloud platforms and high-performance computing clusters. <div>

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds. Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.

<br />Summary:
The research introduces a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification (UQGNN) for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN includes an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module to capture complex spatial and temporal interactions and a multivariate probabilistic prediction module to estimate mean values and uncertainties. The study aims to address the limitations of deterministic models by quantifying uncertainty and considering correlations among urban phenomena. Experiments on real-world datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago show that UQGNN outperforms existing models in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For instance, in the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. The proposed model shows promise in enhancing spatiotemporal prediction accuracy and reliability in various applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, and disaster response.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

<div> global ensemble-based federated learning, computational heterogeneity, data bias, communication efficiency, deep ensembles

Summary:
SHEFL is a novel global ensemble-based federated learning framework designed to tackle data and system heterogeneity in distributed training scenarios. By allocating different numbers of global models to clients based on their computational resources, SHEFL effectively addresses computational heterogeneity. A novel aggregation scheme is introduced to mitigate bias between clients with varying computational capacities, improving both fairness and overall performance. SHEFL dynamically adjusts the resource ratio across clients to reduce the computational burden of training deep ensembles and mitigate data bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SHEFL outperforms existing approaches in terms of fairness and overall performance when dealing with clients of diverse computational capacities. <div>
arXiv:2508.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients, but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML) framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation, our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant statistical heterogeneity across clients.

<div> Keywords: low-rank training, matrix decompositions, neural networks, dynamic-rank training, model accuracy

Summary: 
Low-rank training methods in neural networks reduce trainable parameters by re-parameterizing weights with matrix decompositions like singular value decomposition. However, fixed low-rank structures can limit the model's learning capability of complex patterns. The effective rank of the weights declines during training, which is accelerated in low-rank reparameterization. The study suggests interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank epochs to restore the weight matrix rank effectively. A dynamic-rank training framework is proposed to address rank collapse during training, adjusting the weight matrix rank. Empirical results validate the framework, showing comparable accuracy to full-rank training with similar computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training across various benchmarks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: semantic text classification, large language models, token-driven sparse finetuning, specialized classification tasks, small language models

Summary: 
Token-driven sparse finetuning is proposed for adapting small language models to specialized semantic classification tasks. This approach identifies and finetunes a small subset of model parameters based on task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, without introducing additional parameters to the model. The method outperforms end-to-end finetuning, low rank adaptation (LoRA), layer selection, and prefix tuning on various semantic classification tasks. It demonstrates greater stability, reduces training costs by half compared to end-to-end finetuning, and achieves improved performance in tasks requiring the understanding of contextual significance of tokens. This strategy addresses the need for customized classifiers in specialized applications that necessitate high inference throughputs and domain-specific annotation. <div>
arXiv:2508.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords (as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Summary: 
MiGrATe is a novel method for online Test-Time Training (TTT) that utilizes GRPO as a search algorithm to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference without the need for external training data. MiGrATe employs a mixed-policy group construction approach that combines on-policy sampling with off-policy data selection techniques, such as greedy sampling and neighborhood sampling, to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation in solution space. By biasing the policy gradient towards promising regions while preserving exploration, MiGrATe outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines across various challenging domains like word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program induction. This study showcases the potential of online TTT as a viable solution for complex search tasks that do not require external supervision. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently, test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques: greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without external supervision.

Accurate prediction of molecular properties is crucial for various scientific fields. Traditional molecular representation methods like fingerprints and graph neural networks are effective but lack contextual knowledge.

This multi-view framework dynamically fuses perspectives to adapt to different tasks, leading to state-of-the-art performance on classification and regression benchmarks. The $\text{M}^{2}$LLM leverages large language models' reasoning abilities to generate rich molecular representations. By encoding molecular embeddings and curating features through advanced reasoning processes, the LLM approach demonstrates exceptional performance. This innovative methodology bridges the gap between molecular structures and advanced reasoning, yielding promising results in various applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery. Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.

The article introduces a novel approach for Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) that addresses challenges related to model stability and adaptability. By enhancing traditional ensemble learning with a Global Workspace Model (GWM), which serves as a shared memory for multiple student models, the proposed method aims to maintain stability under memory constraints while ensuring adaptability to new tasks. The GWM captures historical learning trajectories and consolidates knowledge across students, promoting cross-task consistency. Additionally, a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism enforces peer-to-peer consistency and aligns student models with the GWM to preserve historical knowledge. Experimental results on OCIL benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvement across various memory budgets, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving a balance between stability and plasticity.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective. While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared, implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch, capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models across various memory budgets.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences, lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a challenging combinatorial optimization task with practical applications. Traditional heuristic solvers struggle with larger instances, leading researchers to explore neural network solvers. However, neural networks have difficulty generalizing beyond synthetic data. The authors introduce Combinatorial Optimization with Generative Sampling (COGS), which addresses distribution robustness by training on generative TSP data. They also introduce TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples for testing real-world generalization. COGS outperforms existing neural baselines, especially in worst-case scenarios, by providing better data coverage and interpolation in the TSP training distribution space. The method is evaluated on synthetic datasets and TSPLib50, demonstrating improved distribution robustness and performance gains in challenging scenarios. 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50, and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from worst-case scenarios.

Summary: 
This article discusses the theoretical analysis of the discretization complexity of rectified flow (RF)-based models in both multi-step and one-step generation tasks. The study proves the first polynomial discretization complexity for RF-based models with a deterministic sampler, under the bounded support assumption. Inspired by the predictor-corrector framework of diffusion models, a Langevin process is introduced as a corrector in the multi-step setting, demonstrating better polynomial discretization complexity compared to diffusion models. Detailed analysis of RF-based models is provided, highlighting their superior performance over popular models like variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding (VE) based models. Additionally, the study offers the first polynomial discretization complexity result for one-step RF-based models, surpassing previous results for one-step diffusion-based models. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the exceptional empirical performance of RF-based models in both multi-step and one-step generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation. However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding (VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both multi-step and one-step generation.

<div> Sparse Autoencoder, Reward Model, Interpretability, Feature-level Attribution, Alignment performance

Summary: 
The study introduces the novel Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (SARM) to improve the interpretability and flexibility of reward models used for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Large Language Models (LLMs). SARM integrates a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into the reward model, allowing for direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments and dynamic adjustment to preference shifts. The architecture of SARM enables transparent and conceptually meaningful reward scores by mapping the hidden activations of the LLM-based reward model into a sparse and interpretable feature space. Empirical evaluations show that SARM outperforms conventional reward models in terms of alignment performance, providing a more accurate and reliable way to align LLM behaviors with human values. The code for SARM is available on GitHub for further exploration and experimentation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment performance compared to conventional reward models.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces the DiFac framework for semi-supervised learning in graph neural networks to improve performance with unlabeled data. It addresses the challenge of obtaining mutually independent decision factors by deriving and enforcing consistency from a single information source. The model learns to extract these factors during pre-training and removes conflicting samples during training, reducing overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Additional textual knowledge can also be incorporated, with an accountability scoring mechanism to mitigate errors. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that DiFac consistently enhances robustness and generalization in low-label scenarios, outperforming baseline methods. <div>

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However, obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and responsible AI development.

<div> Keywords: telecommunications network, fault alarms, Network Operations Centre, root alarm identification, unsupervised alarm relation learning<br />
Summary:<br />
In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure continuous network operations. With a large number of network nodes possibly from multiple vendors, the volume of alarms can be overwhelming for NOC engineers. The process of active alarms analysis and root alarm identification can be challenging, given the interconnected nature of network nodes. To address this, a novel unsupervised alarm relation learning technique called Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) is proposed. TempOpt aims to improve the accuracy and speed of identifying root alarms by learning relationships among alarms. Experiments conducted on real-world network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TempOpt in comparison to existing temporal dependency methods. This approach offers practical solutions for enhancing the quality of alarm relations learned in a network monitoring setting. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time. Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency method.

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing. Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters. Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.

Summary: 
This article introduces a systematic framework for constructing training datasets for generative machine learning models to enhance design representation and interpretability. The framework generates internally homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous archetypes to build a diverse training dataset. By integrating generative models with Bayesian optimization, the latent space of admissible designs becomes more interpretable, aiding in identifying optimal features. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the design of a flow battery manifold, showcasing its ability to capture feasible designs and explore novel configurations efficiently. This work expands the use of generative machine-learning models in system design, improving quality and reliability.

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

Summary: 
The article introduces Oblivionis, a framework that allows clients to selectively remove private data during federated learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current federated LLM frameworks lack mechanisms for regulatory compliance like the right to be forgotten under GDPR. Oblivionis addresses this gap by unifying federated learning and unlearning as dual optimization objectives. It incorporates various federated learning and unlearning algorithms for evaluation, demonstrating superior performance compared to local training. Oblivionis strikes a balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance in federated LLM training. The framework provides clear directions for future LLM development by enabling selective removal of specific data and ensuring data privacy in collaborative training settings. <div>
arXiv:2508.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten. Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5 unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis, establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM development.

Summary:
Genetic algorithms are utilized to identify strong lottery ticket subnetworks within overparameterized neural networks for efficient and effective model training. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis suggests that certain subnetworks within these networks can achieve high accuracy without training. The approach achieves superior accuracies and sparsity levels for binary and multi-class classification tasks compared to current methods, without the need for gradient information. Proper evaluation metrics are emphasized for scaling to more complex network architectures and learning tasks. This research challenges traditional paradigms by focusing on minimizing resource consumption from the outset rather than relying on model compression techniques post-training. <div>
arXiv:2508.08877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters, making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks, there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex network architectures and learning tasks.

Summary: 
Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making through the combination of machine learning algorithms and causal inference. However, these methods are not widely adopted within the machine learning community due to a lack of reliability and robustness in current empirical evaluations. The overuse of synthetic experiments is a major criticism, but the authors argue that synthetic experiments are crucial for accurately assessing and understanding the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. By critically reviewing current evaluation practices and proposing a set of principles for rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data, the authors aim to build trust in causal machine learning methods and promote their broader adoption for impactful real-world applications. Adopting these principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that drive the practical utility and credibility of causal machine learning methods.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful real-world use.

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns. However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet) that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities, thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Summary: 
Class-incremental continual learning aims to address catastrophic forgetting by allowing models to retain knowledge of previously learned classes while learning new ones. However, this study finds that models undergoing continual learning are vulnerable to stage-transferred attacks, where an adversarial example generated using a past model stage can compromise the model in a later stage. The susceptibility to these attacks is attributed to model similarity between stages and the gradual degradation of robustness. Moreover, existing adversarial training-based defense mechanisms are found to be inadequate in mitigating stage-transferred attacks. This research highlights a significant security concern in continual learning paradigms and underscores the need for robust defense strategies to protect against adversarial threats. The code for this study is available on GitHub for further exploration and validation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation. Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering problems.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces GenCast, a model designed to forecast traffic in regions lacking sensors by incorporating external knowledge. It leverages physics-informed neural networks to improve generalization through physical principles. An external signal learning module is employed to analyze correlations between traffic conditions and external factors like weather. A spatial grouping module helps filter out local features that might hinder the model's performance. Experimental results demonstrate GenCast's ability to reduce forecasting errors across multiple real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The GRAVITY framework for accurate vertex classification is inspired by physical systems where vertices self-organize based on learned interactions. Vertex influence is shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity, creating a latent potential field that drives vertices towards energy-efficient positions. Unlike traditional approaches, GRAVITY dynamically modulates the receptive field of each vertex, enabling adaptive aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens class boundaries and enhances semantic coherence within latent clusters. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that GRAVITY produces competitive embeddings and excels in both transductive and inductive vertex classification tasks. <div>

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY (Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity. These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification tasks.

<div> susceptibility, adversarial attacks, time series forecasting, frequency domain features, prediction

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the vulnerability of deep learning models, specifically Transformer-based models, to adversarial attacks in time series forecasting. While research on adversarial robustness in fields like computer vision is extensive, the frequency domain aspects of time series data have not been sufficiently explored in terms of attacks. The paper introduces a novel attack algorithm focused on frequency domain loss for time series prediction. By optimizing adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses, the proposed approach demonstrates significant success on popular time series forecasting datasets. This highlights the need to consider frequency information when assessing the robustness of time series prediction models against adversarial attacks. <div>

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series forecasting datasets.

<title>Integrating attention into explanation frameworks for language and vision transformers</title>

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture, providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks, highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

<title>Low-Regret and Low-Complexity Learning for Hierarchical Inference</title>

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string, simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers, creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable efficiency.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have an increasingly important role in preventing exploitation of network vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Recent deep learning based developments have resulted in significant improvements in the performance of IDS systems. In this paper, we present FetFIDS, where we explore the employment of feature embedding instead of positional embedding to improve intrusion detection performance of a transformer based deep learning system. Our model is developed with the aim of deployments in edge learning scenarios, where federated learning over multiple communication rounds can ensure both privacy and localized performance improvements. FetFIDS outperforms multiple state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems in a federated environment and demonstrates a high degree of suitability to federated learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces the OPIAID algorithm, a novel approach for predicting and recommending personalized opioid dosages for individual patients. The algorithm optimizes pain management while minimizing opioid related adverse events (ORADE) by employing machine learning models trained on observational electronic health records (EHR) data. It leverages a causal machine learning approach to understand the relationship between opioid dose, case specific patient and intraoperative characteristics, and pain versus ORADE outcomes. The OPIAID algorithm considers patient-specific characteristics and the influence of different opiates, enabling personalized dose recommendations. This paper outlines the algorithm's methodology and architecture, and discusses key assumptions, and approaches to evaluating its performance.

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large, structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42 topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard practices.

<title>Chi-Geometry: A Library for Benchmarking Chirality Prediction of GNNs</title>

arXiv:2508.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA GNN architectures.

<title>Bridging Formal Language with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Geometry Problem Solving</title>

arXiv:2508.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis, training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

arXiv:2508.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware inference over structured data.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration, especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy. Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

Abstract: Recent advances in wearable technology have enabled the continuous monitoring of vital physiological signals, essential for predictive modeling and early detection of extreme physiological events. Among these physiological signals, heart rate (HR) plays a central role, as it is widely used in monitoring and managing cardiovascular conditions and detecting extreme physiological events such as hypoglycemia. However, data from wearable devices often suffer from missing values. To address this issue, recent studies have employed various imputation techniques. Traditionally, the effectiveness of these methods has been evaluated using predictive accuracy metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE, which assess numerical proximity to the original data. While informative, these metrics fail to capture the complex statistical structure inherent in physiological signals. This study bridges this gap by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of four statistical imputation methods, linear interpolation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP), and B splines, for short term HR data gaps. We assess their performance using both predictive accuracy metrics and statistical distance measures, including the Cohen Distance Test (CDT) and Jensen Shannon Distance (JS Distance), applied to HR data from the D1NAMO dataset and the BIG IDEAs Lab Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device dataset. The analysis reveals limitations in existing imputation approaches and the absence of a robust framework for evaluating imputation quality in physiological signals. Finally, this study proposes a foundational framework to develop a composite evaluation metric to assess imputation performance.

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e., "Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a 1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact, interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition. With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task, particularly when aiming to avoid subjective assessments. This paper proposes a framework for leveraging subjective metrics derived from the class textual materials across different semesters to assess LLM outputs across various tasks. By utilizing well-defined benchmarks, factual datasets, and structured evaluation pipelines, the approach ensures consistent, reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements. The framework emphasizes automation and transparency in scoring, reducing reliance on human interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and other high-stakes domains.

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B, and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

Abstract: The scientific process is a means for turning the results of experiments into knowledge about the world in which we live. Much research effort has been directed toward automating this process. To do this, one needs to formulate the scientific process in a precise mathematical language. This paper outlines one such language. What is presented here is hardly new. The material leans much on great thinkers of times past as well as more modern contributions. The novel contributions of this paper are: A new, general data processing inequality, a bias variance decomposition for canonical losses, Streamlined proofs of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein and Randomization Theorems, and Means to calculate deficiency via linear programming.

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances -- yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse, noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network, approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice data is sparse and noisy.

Abstract: Understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts is a central challenge in functional genomics, with important implications for therapeutic discovery and precision medicine. Single-cell technologies enable high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type. Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type, limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous, time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling, CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation, and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways. These results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.

Abstract: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion - the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning, which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products. Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers, and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate such algorithms.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency, and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released at https://github.com/NingLi670/SRP.

Abstract: Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous algorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes, often overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap by introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped largely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a concrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social determinants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma distribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact individual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers findings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates, that are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes may introduce new structural injustice when addressing existing discrimination. Considering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a more comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual environments, which is essential for understanding and achieving fairness effectively and transparently.

<title>ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction</title>

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for \textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder, starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g. texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations. Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced scenarios compared to other models.

<title>The DNA of nuclear models: How AI predicts nuclear masses</title>

Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However, the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and explain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop). Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969. The end result is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses.

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise, query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

<title>Selective KV-Cache Sharing to Mitigate Timing Side-Channels in LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT), making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and (iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method, SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from 50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM inference.

Abstract: Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural prediction.

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities, convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2 scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM, they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively, over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20 open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant. Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones, while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more predictable and aligned with human intent.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address social and behavioral determinants of health by transforming labor intensive workflows in resource-constrained settings. Creating LLM-based applications that serve the needs of underserved communities requires a deep understanding of their local context, but it is often the case that neither LLMs nor their developers possess this local expertise, and the experts in these communities often face severe time/resource constraints. This creates a disconnect: how can one engage in meaningful co-design of an LLM-based application for an under-resourced community when the communication channel between the LLM developer and domain expert is constrained? We explored this question through a real-world case study, in which our data science team sought to partner with social workers at a safety net hospital to build an LLM application that summarizes patients' social needs. Whereas prior works focus on the challenge of prompt tuning, we found that the most critical challenge in this setting is the careful and precise specification of \what information to surface to providers so that the LLM application is accurate, comprehensive, and verifiable. Here we present a novel co-design framework for settings with limited access to domain experts, in which the summary generation task is first decomposed into individually-optimizable attributes and then each attribute is efficiently refined and validated through a multi-tier cascading approach.

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more broadly applicable.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for systems with high-dimensional quantities of interest remains challenging, particularly when training data are costly to acquire. This work develops multifidelity methods for multiple-input multiple-output linear regression targeting data-limited applications with high-dimensional outputs. Multifidelity methods integrate many inexpensive low-fidelity model evaluations with limited, costly high-fidelity evaluations. We introduce two projection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches that leverage principal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and combine multifidelity data through: (i) a direct data augmentation using low-fidelity data, and (ii) a data augmentation incorporating explicit linear corrections between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The data augmentation approaches combine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into a unified training set and train the linear regression model through weighted least squares with fidelity-specific weights. Various weighting schemes and their impact on regression accuracy are explored. The proposed multifidelity linear regression methods are demonstrated on approximating the surface pressure field of a hypersonic vehicle in flight. In a low-data regime of no more than ten high-fidelity samples, multifidelity linear regression achieves approximately 3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity methods with comparable computational cost.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a multi-target backdoor attack against speaker identification using position-independent clicking sounds as triggers. Unlike previous single-target approaches, our method targets up to 50 speakers simultaneously, achieving success rates of up to 95.04%. To simulate more realistic attack conditions, we vary the signal-to-noise ratio between speech and trigger, demonstrating a trade-off between stealth and effectiveness. We further extend the attack to the speaker verification task by selecting the most similar training speaker - based on cosine similarity - as the target. The attack is most effective when target and enrolled speaker pairs are highly similar, reaching success rates of up to 90% in such cases.

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

<title>Transferable Model-agnostic Vision-Language Model Adaptation for Efficient Weak-to-Strong Generalization</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer (IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

<title>In-Context Learning as Nonparametric Conditional Probability Estimation: Risk Bounds and Optimality</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL) for multiclass classification. We model each task as a sequence of labeled prompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the conditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the expected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This allows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk in transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the minimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method for controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering entropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal rate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the exclusive architecture capable of effective ICL.

Abstract: Modeling limit order books (LOBs) dynamics is a fundamental problem in market microstructure research. In particular, generating high-dimensional volume snapshots with strong temporal and liquidity-dependent patterns remains a challenging task, despite recent work exploring the application of Generative Adversarial Networks to LOBs. In this work, we propose a conditional \textbf{Diff}usion model for the generation of future LOB \textbf{Volume} snapshots (\textbf{DiffVolume}). We evaluate our model across three axes: (1) \textit{Realism}, where we show that DiffVolume, conditioned on past volume history and time of day, better reproduces statistical properties such as marginal distribution, spatial correlation, and autocorrelation decay; (2) \textit{Counterfactual generation}, allowing for controllable generation under hypothetical liquidity scenarios by additionally conditioning on a target future liquidity profile; and (3) \textit{Downstream prediction}, where we show that the synthetic counterfactual data from our model improves the performance of future liquidity forecasting models. Together, these results suggest that DiffVolume provides a powerful and flexible framework for realistic and controllable LOB volume generation.

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes, repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases. To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at https://github.com/oxu2/SafeFix

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have greatly expanded the repertoire of predictive methods for medical imaging. However, the interpretability of complex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical applications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure conditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models. However, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a common problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a model-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as the discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the outcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains computationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate control. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance under high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We benchmarked Hierarchical-CPI against state-of-the-art variable importance methods. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in two neuroimaging datasets: classifying dementia diagnoses from MRI data (ADNI dataset) and analyzing the Berger effect on EEG data (TDBRAIN dataset), identifying biologically plausible variables.

<title>Sensitivity Analysis to Unobserved Confounding with Copula-based Normalizing Flows</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding in causal inference. The method builds on a copula-based causal graphical normalizing flow that we term $\rho$-GNF, where $\rho \in [-1,+1]$ is the sensitivity parameter. The parameter represents the non-causal association between exposure and outcome due to unobserved confounding, which is modeled as a Gaussian copula. In other words, the $\rho$-GNF enables scholars to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$, accounting for various confounding strengths. The output of the $\rho$-GNF is what we term the $\rho_{curve}$, which provides the bounds for the ACE given an interval of assumed $\rho$ values. The $\rho_{curve}$ also enables scholars to identify the confounding strength required to nullify the ACE. We also propose a Bayesian version of our sensitivity analysis method. Assuming a prior over the sensitivity parameter $\rho$ enables us to derive the posterior distribution over the ACE, which enables us to derive credible intervals. Finally, leveraging on experiments from simulated and real-world data, we show the benefits of our sensitivity analysis method.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely on a global error signal generated at the network's output.
  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly. Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information. Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle, linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.
  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC, focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter (KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python examples using PyTorch.

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge, especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact, interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient, profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in recommender systems.

Abstract: Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing (FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA). According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced performance of exploration and exploitation which we call exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale problems with correspondingly low computational cost.

Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images. Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a promising direction for image information leakage estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety interventions and interpretability research.

Abstract: One of the fastest-growing domains in AI is healthcare. Given its importance, it has been the interest of many researchers to deploy ML models into the ever-demanding healthcare domain to aid doctors and increase accessibility. Delivering reliable models, however, demands a sizable amount of data, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of the rampant and scary nature of healthcare that makes training models difficult. To alleviate such scarcity, many published works attempted to synthesize radiological cough data to train better COVID-19 detection models on the respective radiological data. To accommodate the time sensitivity expected during a pandemic, this work focuses on detecting COVID-19 through coughs using synthetic data to improve the accuracy of the classifier. The work begins by training a CNN on a balanced subset of the Coughvid dataset, establishing a baseline classification test accuracy of 72%. The paper demonstrates how an Auxiliary Classification GAN (ACGAN) may be trained to conditionally generate novel synthetic Mel Spectrograms of both healthy and COVID-19 coughs. These coughs are used to augment the training dataset of the CNN classifier, allowing it to reach a new test accuracy of 75%. The work highlights the expected messiness and inconsistency in training and offers insights into detecting and handling such shortcomings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture, segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity. Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0 guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to 7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-, voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core, contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively. Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification, and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging, scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence. Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11 minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to 32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression, offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget, achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design, showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at: https://github.com/hammoudhasan/curriculum_grpo.

Abstract: Evaluating audio generation systems, including text-to-music (TTM), text-to-speech (TTS), and text-to-audio (TTA), remains challenging due to the subjective and multi-dimensional nature of human perception. Existing methods treat mean opinion score (MOS) prediction as a regression problem, but standard regression losses overlook the relativity of perceptual judgments. To address this limitation, we introduce QAMRO, a novel Quality-aware Adaptive Margin Ranking Optimization framework that seamlessly integrates regression objectives from different perspectives, aiming to highlight perceptual differences and prioritize accurate ratings. Our framework leverages pre-trained audio-text models such as CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics, and is trained exclusively on the official AudioMOS Challenge 2025 dataset. It demonstrates superior alignment with human evaluations across all dimensions, significantly outperforming robust baseline models.

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering, expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration (SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

<title>Retrospective Sparse Attention for Efficient Long-Context Generation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache, RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by up to 21.9\%.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered, incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive environments, fingerprinting attacks pose significant privacy and security risks. We present a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives. Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation strategies against fingerprinting attacks.

<title>P/D-Device: Disaggregated Large Language Model between Cloud and Devices</title>

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time, essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase. Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT. Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device, and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud throughput increases by up to 15x.

<title>CVCM Track Circuits Pre-emptive Failure Diagnostics for Predictive Maintenance Using Deep Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation (CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset, it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes, struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures. Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving 99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems, enhancing operational reliability.

Abstract: Wireless communication systems can significantly benefit from the availability of spatially consistent representations of the wireless channel to efficiently perform a wide range of communication tasks. Towards this purpose, channel charting has been introduced as an effective unsupervised learning technique to achieve both locally and globally consistent radio maps. In this letter, we propose Chartwin, a case study on the integration of localization-oriented channel charting with dynamic Digital Network Twins (DNTs). Numerical results showcase the significant performance of semi-supervised channel charting in constructing a spatially consistent chart of the considered extended urban environment. The considered method results in $\approx$ 4.5 m localization error for the static DNT and $\approx$ 6 m in the dynamic DNT, fostering DNT-aided channel charting and localization.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected device. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection system that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a network. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown attacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms to maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA) algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across datasets and even with different backbones.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of detail.

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative, utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework, named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently, [Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total $x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code. Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical qubits.

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals, nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

Abstract: We study the properties of stochastic approximation applied to a tame nondifferentiable function subject to constraints defined by a Riemannian manifold. The objective landscape of tame functions, arising in o-minimal topology extended to a geometric category when generalized to manifolds, exhibits some structure that enables theoretical guarantees of expected function decrease and asymptotic convergence for generic stochastic sub-gradient descent. Recent work has shown that this class of functions faithfully model the loss landscape of deep neural network training objectives, and the autograd operation used in deep learning packages implements a variant of subgradient descent with the correct properties for convergence. Riemannian optimization uses geometric properties of a constraint set to perform a minimization procedure while enforcing adherence to the the optimization variable lying on a Riemannian manifold. This paper presents the first study of tame optimization on Riemannian manifolds, highlighting the rich geometric structure of the problem and confirming the appropriateness of the canonical "SGD" for such a problem with the analysis and numerical reports of a simple Retracted SGD algorithm.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of black-box models has become not just a legal requirement, but also an additional way to assess their performance. However, the state of the art post-hoc explanation approaches for regression models rely on synthetic data generation, which introduces uncertainty and can hurt the reliability of the explanations. Furthermore, they tend to produce explanations that apply to only very few data points. In this paper, we present BELLA, a deterministic model-agnostic post-hoc approach for explaining the individual predictions of regression black-box models. BELLA provides explanations in the form of a linear model trained in the feature space. BELLA maximizes the size of the neighborhood to which the linear model applies so that the explanations are accurate, simple, general, and robust.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) models offer a powerful nonparametric approach for Bayesian inference, but exact inference is typically intractable, motivating the use of various approximations. However, existing approaches, such as mean-field Gaussian assumptions, limit the expressiveness and efficacy of DGP models, while stochastic approximation can be computationally expensive. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Neural Operator Variational Inference (NOVI) for Deep Gaussian Processes. NOVI uses a neural generator to obtain a sampler and minimizes the Regularized Stein Discrepancy in L2 space between the generated distribution and true posterior. We solve the minimax problem using Monte Carlo estimation and subsampling stochastic optimization techniques. We demonstrate that the bias introduced by our method can be controlled by multiplying the Fisher divergence with a constant, which leads to robust error control and ensures the stability and precision of the algorithm. Our experiments on datasets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands demonstrate the effectiveness and the faster convergence rate of the proposed method. We achieve a classification accuracy of 93.56 on the CIFAR10 dataset, outperforming SOTA Gaussian process methods. Furthermore, our method guarantees theoretically controlled prediction error for DGP models and demonstrates remarkable performance on various datasets. We are optimistic that NOVI has the potential to enhance the performance of deep Bayesian nonparametric models and could have significant implications for various practical applications

Abstract: Over the years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular approach to develop signal control and vehicle platooning strategies either independently or in a hierarchical way. However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance and training stability across various tasks but lack two critical properties of simulation-based methods: freedom of dimensionality and adaptability to different inference trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.

Abstract: In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics. The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used. This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from both theoretical computing and experiments.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) describes a language model's ability to generate outputs based on a set of input demonstrations and a subsequent query. To understand this remarkable capability, researchers have studied simplified, stylized models. These studies have consistently observed long loss plateaus, during which models exhibit minimal improvement, followed by a sudden, rapid surge of learning. In this work, we reveal that training on multiple diverse ICL tasks simultaneously shortens the loss plateaus, making each task easier to learn. This finding is surprising as it contradicts the natural intuition that the combined complexity of multiple ICL tasks would lengthen the learning process, not shorten it. Our result suggests that the recent success in large-scale training of language models may be attributed not only to the richness of the data at scale but also to the easier optimization (training) induced by the diversity of natural language training data.

Abstract: Generalizing vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents to novel environments remains a difficult and open challenge. Current trends are to collect large-scale datasets or use data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve downstream generalization. However, the computational and data collection costs increase exponentially with the number of task variations and can destabilize the already difficult task of training RL agents. In this work, we take inspiration from recent advances in computational neuroscience and propose a model, Associative Latent DisentAnglement (ALDA), that builds on standard off-policy RL towards zero-shot generalization. Specifically, we revisit the role of latent disentanglement in RL and show how combining it with a model of associative memory achieves zero-shot generalization on difficult task variations without relying on data augmentation. Finally, we formally show that data augmentation techniques are a form of weak disentanglement and discuss the implications of this insight.

Abstract: Control in fluid environments is an important research area with numerous applications across various domains, including underwater robotics, aerospace engineering, and biomedical systems. However, in practice, control methods often face challenges due to sparse or missing observations, stemming from sensor limitations and faults. These issues result in observations that are not only sparse but also inconsistent in their number and modalities (e.g., velocity and pressure sensors). In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Representation (PIR) algorithm for multi-modal policies of control to leverage the sparse and random observations in complex fluid environments. PIR integrates sparse observational data with the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) information to distill a unified representation of fluid systems. The main idea is that PDE solutions are determined by three elements: the equation, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. Given the equation, we only need to learn the representation of the initial and boundary conditions, which define a trajectory of a specific fluid system. Specifically, it leverages PDE loss to fit the neural network and data loss calculated on the observations with random quantities and multi-modalities to propagate the information with initial and boundary conditions into the representations. The representations are the learnable parameters or the output of the encoder. In the experiments, the PIR illustrates the superior consistency with the features of the ground truth compared with baselines, even when there are missing modalities. Furthermore, PIR combined with Reinforcement Learning has been successfully applied in control tasks where the robot leverages the learned state by PIR faster and more accurately, passing through the complex vortex street from a random starting location to reach a random target.

<title>Understanding Aggregations of Proper Learners in Multiclass Classification</title>

Abstract: Multiclass learnability is known to exhibit a properness barrier: there are learnable classes which cannot be learned by any proper learner. Binary classification faces no such barrier for learnability, but a similar one for optimal learning, which can in general only be achieved by improper learners. Fortunately, recent advances in binary classification have demonstrated that this requirement can be satisfied using aggregations of proper learners, some of which are strikingly simple. This raises a natural question: to what extent can simple aggregations of proper learners overcome the properness barrier in multiclass classification?
  We give a positive answer to this question for classes which have finite Graph dimension, $d_G$. Namely, we demonstrate that the optimal binary learners of Hanneke, Larsen, and Aden-Ali et al. (appropriately generalized to the multiclass setting) achieve sample complexity $O\left(\frac{d_G + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$. This forms a strict improvement upon the sample complexity of ERM. We complement this with a lower bound demonstrating that for certain classes of Graph dimension $d_G$, majorities of ERM learners require $\Omega \left( \frac{d_G + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$ samples. Furthermore, we show that a single ERM requires $\Omega \left(\frac{d_G \ln(1 / \epsilon) + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$ samples on such classes, exceeding the lower bound of Daniely et al. (2015) by a factor of $\ln(1 / \epsilon)$. For multiclass learning in full generality -- i.e., for classes of finite DS dimension but possibly infinite Graph dimension -- we give a strong refutation to these learning strategies, by exhibiting a learnable class which cannot be learned to constant error by any aggregation of a finite number of proper learners.

Abstract: Chemical synthesis remains a critical bottleneck in the discovery and manufacture of functional small molecules. AI-based synthesis planning models could be a potential remedy to find effective syntheses, and have made progress in recent years. However, they still struggle with less frequent, yet critical reactions for synthetic strategy, as well as hallucinated, incorrect predictions. This hampers multi-step search algorithms that rely on models, and leads to misalignment with chemists' expectations. Here we propose RetroChimera: a frontier retrosynthesis model, built upon two newly developed components with complementary inductive biases, which we fuse together using a new framework for integrating predictions from multiple sources via a learning-based ensembling strategy. Through experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and splitting strategy, we show RetroChimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, demonstrating robustness outside the training data, as well as for the first time the ability to learn from even a very small number of examples per reaction class. Moreover, industrial organic chemists prefer predictions from RetroChimera over the reactions it was trained on in terms of quality, revealing high levels of alignment. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer to an internal dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our ensembling framework unlocks, we anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate models.

Abstract: Language models have recently been shown capable of performing regression wherein numeric predictions are represented as decoded strings. In this work, we provide theoretical grounds for this capability and furthermore investigate the utility of causal sequence decoding models as numeric regression heads given any feature representation. We find that, despite being trained in the usual way - for next-token prediction via cross-entropy loss - decoder-based heads are as performant as standard pointwise heads when benchmarked over standard regression tasks, while being flexible enough to capture smooth numeric distributions, such as in the task of density estimation.

<title>FBFL: A Field-Based Coordination Approach for Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: In the last years, Federated learning (FL) has become a popular solution to train machine learning models in domains with high privacy concerns. However, FL scalability and performance face significant challenges in real-world deployments where data across devices are non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID). The heterogeneity in data distribution frequently arises from spatial distribution of devices, leading to degraded model performance in the absence of proper handling. Additionally, FL typical reliance on centralized architectures introduces bottlenecks and single-point-of-failure risks, particularly problematic at scale or in dynamic environments. To close this gap, we propose Field-Based Federated Learning (FBFL), a novel approach leveraging macroprogramming and field coordination to address these limitations through: (i) distributed spatial-based leader election for personalization to mitigate non-IID data challenges; and (ii) construction of a self-organizing, hierarchical architecture using advanced macroprogramming patterns. Moreover, FBFL not only overcomes the aforementioned limitations, but also enables the development of more specialized models tailored to the specific data distribution in each subregion. This paper formalizes FBFL and evaluates it extensively using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Extended MNIST datasets. We demonstrate that, when operating under IID data conditions, FBFL performs comparably to the widely-used FedAvg algorithm. Furthermore, in challenging non-IID scenarios, FBFL not only outperforms FedAvg but also surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, namely FedProx and Scaffold, which have been specifically designed to address non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we showcase the resilience of FBFL's self-organizing hierarchical architecture against server failures.

<title>Forget the Data and Fine-Tuning! Just Fold the Network to Compress</title>

Abstract: We introduce model folding, a novel data-free model compression technique that merges structurally similar neurons across layers, significantly reducing the model size without the need for fine-tuning or access to training data. Unlike existing methods, model folding preserves data statistics during compression by leveraging k-means clustering, and using novel data-free techniques to prevent variance collapse or explosion. Our theoretical framework and experiments across standard benchmarks, including ResNet18 and LLaMA-7B, demonstrate that model folding achieves comparable performance to data-driven compression techniques and outperforms recently proposed data-free methods, especially at high sparsity levels. This approach is particularly effective for compressing large-scale models, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<title>LLM-Lasso: A Robust Framework for Domain-Informed Feature Selection and Regularization</title>

Abstract: We introduce LLM-Lasso, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to guide feature selection in Lasso $\ell_1$ regression. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on numerical data, LLM-Lasso incorporates domain-specific knowledge extracted from natural language, enhanced through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, to seamlessly integrate data-driven modeling with contextual insights. Specifically, the LLM generates penalty factors for each feature, which are converted into weights for the Lasso penalty using a simple, tunable model. Features identified as more relevant by the LLM receive lower penalties, increasing their likelihood of being retained in the final model, while less relevant features are assigned higher penalties, reducing their influence. Importantly, LLM-Lasso has an internal validation step that determines how much to trust the contextual knowledge in our prediction pipeline. Hence it addresses key challenges in robustness, making it suitable for mitigating potential inaccuracies or hallucinations from the LLM. In various biomedical case studies, LLM-Lasso outperforms standard Lasso and existing feature selection baselines, all while ensuring the LLM operates without prior access to the datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to effectively integrate conventional feature selection techniques directly with LLM-based domain-specific reasoning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can lead to erroneous predictions. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can leverage the generators and discriminators model to quickly produce high-quality adversarial examples. Since both modules train in a competitive and simultaneous manner, GAN-based algorithms like AdvGAN can generate adversarial examples with better transferability compared to traditional methods. However, the generation of perturbations is usually limited to a single iteration, preventing these examples from fully exploiting the potential of the methods. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach named Progressive Auto-Regression AdvGAN (PAR-AdvGAN). It incorporates an auto-regressive iteration mechanism within a progressive generation network to craft adversarial examples with enhanced attack capability. We thoroughly evaluate our PAR-AdvGAN method with a large-scale experiment, demonstrating its superior performance over various state-of-the-art black-box adversarial attacks, as well as the original AdvGAN.Moreover, PAR-AdvGAN significantly accelerates the adversarial example generation, i.e., achieving the speeds of up to 335.5 frames per second on Inception-v3 model, outperforming the gradient-based transferable attack algorithms.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating synthetic users for evaluating interactive agents designed to encourage positive behavior changes, such as in health and lifestyle coaching. The synthetic users are grounded in health and lifestyle conditions, specifically sleep and diabetes management in this study, to ensure realistic interactions with the health coaching agent. Synthetic users are created in two stages: first, structured data are generated grounded in real-world health and lifestyle factors in addition to basic demographics and behavioral attributes; second, full profiles of the synthetic users are developed conditioned on the structured data. Interactions between synthetic users and the coaching agent are simulated using generative agent-based models such as Concordia, or directly by prompting a language model. Using two independently-developed agents for sleep and diabetes coaching as case studies, the validity of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing the coaching agent's understanding of the synthetic users' needs and challenges. Finally, through multiple blinded evaluations of user-coach interactions by human experts, we demonstrate that our synthetic users with health and behavioral attributes more accurately portray real human users with the same attributes, compared to generic synthetic users not grounded in such attributes. The proposed framework lays the foundation for efficient development of conversational agents through extensive, realistic, and grounded simulated interactions.

Abstract: The recently proposed Forgetting Transformer (FoX) incorporates a forget gate into softmax attention and has shown consistently better or on-par performance compared to the standard RoPE-based Transformer. Notably, many attention heads in FoX tend to forget quickly, causing their output at each timestep to rely primarily on local context. Based on this observation, we propose Adaptive Computation Pruning (ACP) for FoX, a method that dynamically prunes computations involving input-output dependencies that are strongly decayed by the forget gate. In particular, our method performs provably safe pruning via a dynamically set pruning threshold that guarantees the pruned attention weights are negligible. We apply ACP to language model pretraining with FoX and show it consistently reduces the number of FLOPs and memory accesses in softmax attention by around 70% across different model sizes and context lengths, resulting in a roughly 50% to 70% reduction in attention runtime (or a 2-3$\times$ speedup) and a roughly 10% to 40% increase in end-to-end training throughput. Furthermore, longer context lengths yield greater computational savings. All these speed improvements are achieved without any performance degradation. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhixuan-lin/forgetting-transformer.

Abstract: Deep learning-based electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has shown impressive performance but clinical adoption has been slowed by the lack of transparent and faithful explanations. Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in financial markets requires integrating diverse data sources, from historical prices to macroeconomic indicators and financial news. However, existing models often fail to align these modalities effectively, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based deep learning framework, Cross-Modal Temporal Fusion (CMTF), that fuses structured and unstructured financial data for improved market prediction. The model incorporates a tensor interpretation module for feature selection and an auto-training pipeline for efficient hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results using FTSE 100 stock data demonstrate that CMTF achieves superior performance in price direction classification compared to classical and deep learning baselines. These findings suggest that our framework is an effective and scalable solution for real-world cross-modal financial forecasting tasks.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both (i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency, and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital economy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in the field of distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile devices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global model without the need to centralize sensitive data. This decentralized approach addresses growing concerns around data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance, making it particularly attractive in domains such as healthcare, finance, and smart IoT systems. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of Federated Learning, beginning with its core architecture and communication protocol. We discuss the standard FL lifecycle, including local training, model aggregation, and global updates. A particular emphasis is placed on key technical challenges such as handling non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, mitigating system and hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation. Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable, efficient, and trustworthy FL systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).

Abstract: Clustering algorithms play a pivotal role in unsupervised learning by identifying and grouping similar objects based on shared characteristics. Although traditional clustering techniques, such as hard and fuzzy center-based clustering, have been widely used, they struggle with complex, high-dimensional, and non-Euclidean datasets. In particular, the fuzzy $C$-Means (FCM) algorithm, despite its efficiency and popularity, exhibits notable limitations in non-Euclidean spaces. Euclidean spaces assume linear separability and uniform distance scaling, limiting their effectiveness in capturing complex, hierarchical, or non-Euclidean structures in fuzzy clustering. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Filtration-based Hyperbolic Fuzzy C-Means (HypeFCM), a novel clustering algorithm tailored for better representation of data relationships in non-Euclidean spaces. HypeFCM integrates the principles of fuzzy clustering with hyperbolic geometry and employs a weight-based filtering mechanism to improve performance. The algorithm initializes weights using a Dirichlet distribution and iteratively refines cluster centroids and membership assignments based on a hyperbolic metric in the Poincar\'e Disc model. Extensive experimental evaluations on $6$ synthetic and $12$ real-world datasets demonstrate that HypeFCM significantly outperforms conventional fuzzy clustering methods in non-Euclidean settings, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD), without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning (HFT), performed directly on open-source LLMs or through Fine-tuning-as-a-Service, breaks safety alignment and poses significant threats. Existing methods aim to mitigate HFT risks by learning robust representation on alignment data or making harmful data unlearnable, but they treat each data sample equally, leaving data vulnerability patterns understudied. In this work, we reveal that certain subsets of alignment data are consistently more prone to forgetting during HFT across different fine-tuning tasks. Inspired by these findings, we propose Vulnerability-Aware Alignment (VAA), which estimates data vulnerability, partitions data into "vulnerable" and "invulnerable" groups, and encourages balanced learning using a group distributionally robust optimization (Group DRO) framework. Specifically, VAA learns an adversarial sampler that samples examples from the currently underperforming group and then applies group-dependent adversarial perturbations to the data during training, aiming to encourage a balanced learning process across groups. Experiments across four fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that VAA significantly reduces harmful scores while preserving downstream task performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of the map.

This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.

Abstract: Citizens' assemblies are an increasingly influential form of deliberative democracy, where randomly selected people discuss policy questions. The legitimacy of these assemblies hinges on their representation of the broader population, but participant dropout often leads to an unbalanced composition. In practice, dropouts are replaced by preselected alternates, but existing methods do not address how to choose these alternates. To address this gap, we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected misrepresentation. Our theoretical bounds provide guarantees on sample complexity (with implications for computational efficiency) and on loss due to dropout probability mis-estimation. Empirical evaluation using real-world data demonstrates that, compared to the status quo, our method significantly improves representation while requiring fewer alternates.

<title>DynaSwarm: Dynamically Graph Structure Selection for LLM-based Multi-agent System</title>

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

<title>Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions</title>

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR improves interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks.

Abstract: This article presents an artificial intelligence (AI) architecture intended to simulate the iterative updating of the human working memory system. It features several interconnected neural networks designed to emulate the specialized modules of the cerebral cortex. These are structured hierarchically and integrated into a global workspace. They are capable of temporarily maintaining high-level representational patterns akin to the psychological items maintained in working memory. This maintenance is made possible by persistent neural activity in the form of two modalities: sustained neural firing (resulting in a focus of attention) and synaptic potentiation (resulting in a short-term store). Representations held in persistent activity are recursively replaced resulting in incremental changes to the content of the working memory system. As this content gradually evolves, successive processing states overlap and are continuous with one another. The present article will explore how this architecture can lead to iterative shift in the distribution of coactive representations, ultimately leading to mental continuity between processing states, and thus to human-like thought and cognition. Like the human brain, this AI working memory store will be linked to multiple imagery (topographic map) generation systems corresponding to various sensory modalities. As working memory is iteratively updated, the maps created in response will construct sequences of related mental imagery. Thus, neural networks emulating the prefrontal cortex and its reciprocal interactions with early sensory and motor cortex capture the imagery guidance functions of the human brain. This sensory and motor imagery creation, coupled with an iteratively updated working memory store may provide an AI system with the cognitive assets needed to achieve synthetic consciousness or artificial sentience.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction (TP) for climbing aircraft is hampered by the presence of epistemic uncertainties concerning aircraft operation, which can lead to significant misspecification between predicted and observed trajectories. This paper proposes a generative model for climbing aircraft in which the standard Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model is enriched by a functional correction to the thrust that is learned from data. The method offers three features: predictions of the arrival time with 26.7% less error when compared to BADA; generated trajectories that are realistic when compared to test data; and a means of computing confidence bounds for minimal computational cost.

Abstract: We study the problem of allocating scarce societal resources of different types (e.g., permanent housing, deceased donor kidneys for transplantation, ventilators) to heterogeneous allocatees on a waitlist (e.g., people experiencing homelessness, individuals suffering from end-stage renal disease, Covid-19 patients) based on their observed covariates. We leverage administrative data collected in deployment to design an online policy that maximizes expected outcomes while satisfying budget constraints, in the long run. Our proposed policy waitlists each individual for the resource maximizing the difference between their estimated mean treatment outcome and the estimated resource dual-price or, roughly, the opportunity cost of using the resource. Resources are then allocated as they arrive, in a first-come first-serve fashion. We demonstrate that our data-driven policy almost surely asymptotically achieves the expected outcome of the optimal out-of-sample policy under mild technical assumptions. We extend our framework to incorporate various fairness constraints. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problem of designing policies for allocating scarce housing resources to people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles based on data from the homeless management information system. In particular, we show that using our policies improves rates of exit from homelessness by 5.16% and that policies that are fair in either allocation or outcomes by race come at a very low price of fairness.

Abstract: This article adopts and evaluates an AI-enabled Smart Video Solution (SVS) designed to enhance safety in the real world. The system integrates with existing infrastructure camera networks, leveraging recent advancements in AI for easy adoption. Prioritizing privacy and ethical standards, pose based data is used for downstream AI tasks such as anomaly detection. Cloud-based infrastructure and mobile app are deployed, enabling real-time alerts within communities. The SVS employs innovative data representation and visualization techniques, such as the Occupancy Indicator, Statistical Anomaly Detection, Bird's Eye View, and Heatmaps, to understand pedestrian behaviors and enhance public safety. Evaluation of the SVS demonstrates its capacity to convert complex computer vision outputs into actionable insights for stakeholders, community partners, law enforcement, urban planners, and social scientists. This article presents a comprehensive real-world deployment and evaluation of the SVS, implemented in a community college environment across 16 cameras. The system integrates AI-driven visual processing, supported by statistical analysis, database management, cloud communication, and user notifications. Additionally, the article evaluates the end-to-end latency from the moment an AI algorithm detects anomalous behavior in real-time at the camera level to the time stakeholders receive a notification. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, effectively managing 16 CCTV cameras with a consistent throughput of 16.5 frames per second (FPS) over a 21-hour period and an average end-to-end latency of 26.76 seconds between anomaly detection and alert issuance.

Abstract: The interaction between users and applications is increasingly shifted toward natural language by deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core interface. The capabilities of these so-called agents become more capable the more tools and services they serve as an interface for, ultimately leading to agentic systems. Agentic systems use LLM-based agents as interfaces for most user interactions and various integrations with external tools and services. While these interfaces can significantly enhance the capabilities of the agentic system, they also introduce a new attack surface. Manipulated integrations, for example, can exploit the internal LLM and compromise sensitive data accessed through other interfaces. While previous work primarily focused on attacks targeting a model's alignment or the leakage of training data, the security of data that is only available during inference has escaped scrutiny so far. In this work, we demonstrate how the integration of LLMs into systems with external tool integration poses a risk similar to established prompt-based attacks, able to compromise the confidentiality of the entire system. Introducing a systematic approach to evaluate these confidentiality risks, we identify two specific attack scenarios unique to these agentic systems and formalize these into a tool-robustness framework designed to measure a model's ability to protect sensitive information. Our analysis reveals significant vulnerabilities across all tested models, highlighting an increased risk when models are combined with external tools.

We generated synthetic contracts using the real-world transaction dataset, thereby fine-tuning the large-language model and achieving significant metrics improvements and qualitative improvements in information retrieval and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Vehicular controller area networks (CANs) are susceptible to masquerade attacks by malicious adversaries. In masquerade attacks, adversaries silence a targeted ID and then send malicious frames with forged content at the expected timing of benign frames. As masquerade attacks could seriously harm vehicle functionality and are the stealthiest attacks to detect in CAN, recent work has devoted attention to compare frameworks for detecting masquerade attacks in CAN. However, most existing works report offline evaluations using CAN logs already collected using simulations that do not comply with the domain's real-time constraints. Here we contribute to advance the state of the art by presenting a comparative evaluation of four different non-deep learning (DL)-based unsupervised online intrusion detection systems (IDS) for masquerade attacks in CAN. Our approach differs from existing comparative evaluations in that we analyze the effect of controlling streaming data conditions in a sliding window setting. In doing so, we use realistic masquerade attacks being replayed from the ROAD dataset. We show that although evaluated IDS are not effective at detecting every attack type, the method that relies on detecting changes in the hierarchical structure of clusters of time series produces the best results at the expense of higher computational overhead. We discuss limitations, open challenges, and how the evaluated methods can be used for practical unsupervised online CAN IDS for masquerade attacks.

Abstract: Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.

Abstract: Quantile regression is a powerful tool for robust and heterogeneous learning that has seen applications in a diverse range of applied areas. However, its broader application is often hindered by the substantial computational demands arising from the non-smooth quantile loss function. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm named fastkqr, which significantly advances the computation of quantile regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The core of fastkqr is a finite smoothing algorithm that magically produces exact regression quantiles, rather than approximations. To further accelerate the algorithm, we equip fastkqr with a novel spectral technique that carefully reutilizes matrix computations. In addition, we extend fastkqr to accommodate a flexible kernel quantile regression with a data-driven crossing penalty, addressing the interpretability challenges of crossing quantile curves at multiple levels. We have implemented fastkqr in a publicly available R package. Extensive simulations and real applications show that fastkqr matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms but can operate up to an order of magnitude faster.

Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has achieved significant progress in both research and applications. While recent baselines struggle to generate natural and continuous facial movements due to their frame-by-frame vertex generation approach, we propose 3DFacePolicy, a pioneer work that introduces a novel definition of vertex trajectory changes across consecutive frames through the concept of "action". By predicting action sequences for each vertex that encode frame-to-frame movements, we reformulate vertex generation approach into an action-based control paradigm. Specifically, we leverage a robotic control mechanism, diffusion policy, to predict action sequences conditioned on both audio and vertex states. Extensive experiments on VOCASET and BIWI datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is particularly expert in dynamic, expressive and naturally smooth facial animations.

Abstract: The intricate nature of real-world driving environments, characterized by dynamic and diverse interactions among multiple vehicles and their possible future states, presents considerable challenges in accurately predicting the motion states of vehicles and handling the uncertainty inherent in the predictions. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive modeling and reasoning to capture the implicit relations among vehicles and the corresponding diverse behaviors. This research introduces an integrated framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) motion prediction to address these complexities, utilizing a novel Relational Hypergraph Interaction-informed Neural mOtion generator (RHINO). RHINO leverages hypergraph-based relational reasoning by integrating a multi-scale hypergraph neural network to model group-wise interactions among multiple vehicles and their multi-modal driving behaviors, thereby enhancing motion prediction accuracy and reliability. Experimental validation using real-world datasets demonstrates the superior performance of this framework in improving predictive accuracy and fostering socially aware automated driving in dynamic traffic scenarios. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/keshuw95/RHINO-Hypergraph-Motion-Generation.

Abstract: Human emotions are complex and can be conveyed through nuanced touch gestures. Previous research has primarily focused on how humans recognize emotions through touch or on identifying key features of emotional expression for robots. However, there is a gap in understanding how reliably these emotions and gestures can be communicated to robots via touch and interpreted using data driven methods. This study investigates the consistency and distinguishability of emotional and gestural expressions through touch and sound. To this end, we integrated a custom piezoresistive pressure sensor as well as a microphone on a social robot. Twenty-eight participants first conveyed ten different emotions to the robot using spontaneous touch gestures, then they performed six predefined social touch gestures. Our findings reveal statistically significant consistency in both emotion and gesture expression among participants. However, some emotions exhibited low intraclass correlation values, and certain emotions with similar levels of arousal or valence did not show significant differences in their conveyance. To investigate emotion and social gesture decoding within affective human-robot tactile interaction, we developed single-modality models and multimodal models integrating tactile and auditory features. A support vector machine (SVM) model trained on multimodal features achieved the highest accuracy for classifying ten emotions, reaching 40 %.For gesture classification, a Convolutional Neural Network- Long Short-Term Memory Network (CNN-LSTM) achieved 90.74 % accuracy. Our results demonstrate that even though the unimodal models have the potential to decode emotions and touch gestures, the multimodal integration of touch and sound significantly outperforms unimodal approaches, enhancing the decoding of both emotions and gestures.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of learning good representations from real-world continuous uncurated data streams. However, most existing works in visual self-supervised learning focus on static images or artificial data streams. Towards exploring a more realistic learning substrate, we investigate streaming self-supervised learning from long-form real-world egocentric video streams. Inspired by the event segmentation mechanism in human perception and memory, we propose "Memory Storyboard" that groups recent past frames into temporal segments for more effective summarization of the past visual streams for memory replay. To accommodate efficient temporal segmentation, we propose a two-tier memory hierarchy: the recent past is stored in a short-term memory, and the storyboard temporal segments are then transferred to a long-term memory. Experiments on real-world egocentric video datasets including SAYCam and KrishnaCam show that contrastive learning objectives on top of storyboard frames result in semantically meaningful representations that outperform those produced by state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning methods.

Abstract: We consider applying stochastic approximation (SA) methods to solve nonsmooth variational inclusion problems. Existing studies have shown that the averaged iterates of SA methods exhibit asymptotic normality, with an optimal limiting covariance matrix in the local minimax sense of H\'ajek and Le Cam. However, no methods have been proposed to estimate this covariance matrix in a nonsmooth and potentially non-monotone (nonconvex) setting. In this paper, we study an online batch-means covariance matrix estimator introduced in Zhu et al.(2023). The estimator groups the SA iterates appropriately and computes the sample covariance among batches as an estimate of the limiting covariance. Its construction does not require prior knowledge of the total sample size, and updates can be performed recursively as new data arrives. We establish that, as long as the batch size sequence is properly specified (depending on the stepsize sequence), the estimator achieves a convergence rate of order $O(\sqrt{d}n^{-1/8+\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, where $d$ and $n$ denote the problem dimensionality and the number of iterations (or samples) used. Although the problem is nonsmooth and potentially non-monotone (nonconvex), our convergence rate matches the best-known rate for covariance estimation methods using only first-order information in smooth and strongly-convex settings. The consistency of this covariance estimator enables asymptotically valid statistical inference, including constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis testing.

Abstract: We study tensor completion (TC) through the lens of low-rank tensor decomposition (TD). Many TD algorithms use fast alternating minimization methods to solve highly structured linear regression problems at each step (e.g., for CP, Tucker, and tensor-train decompositions). However, such algebraic structure is often lost in TC regression problems, making direct extensions unclear. This work proposes a novel lifting method for approximately solving TC regression problems using structured TD regression algorithms as blackbox subroutines, enabling sublinear-time methods. We analyze the convergence rate of our approximate Richardson iteration-based algorithm, and our empirical study shows that it can be 100x faster than direct methods for CP completion on real-world tensors.

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of using large multimodal models (LMMs) to automatically annotate human emotions in everyday scenarios. We conducted experiments on the DailyLife subset of the publicly available FERV39k dataset, employing the GPT-4o-mini model for rapid, zero-shot labeling of key frames extracted from video segments. Under a seven-class emotion taxonomy ("Angry," "Disgust," "Fear," "Happy," "Neutral," "Sad," "Surprise"), the LMM achieved an average precision of approximately 50%. In contrast, when limited to ternary emotion classification (negative/neutral/positive), the average precision increased to approximately 64%. Additionally, we explored a strategy that integrates multiple frames within 1-2 second video clips to enhance labeling performance and reduce costs. The results indicate that this approach can slightly improve annotation accuracy. Overall, our preliminary findings highlight the potential application of zero-shot LMMs in human facial emotion annotation tasks, offering new avenues for reducing labeling costs and broadening the applicability of LMMs in complex multimodal environments.

Abstract: Language model outputs are not always reliable, thus prompting research into how to adapt model responses based on uncertainty. Common approaches include: \emph{abstention}, where models refrain from generating responses when uncertain; and \emph{linguistic calibration}, where models hedge their statements using uncertainty quantifiers. However, abstention can withhold valuable information, while linguistically calibrated responses are often challenging to leverage in downstream tasks. We propose a unified view, Conformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), which reinterprets linguistic calibration as \emph{answer set prediction}. First we present a framework connecting abstention and linguistic calibration through the lens of linguistic pragmatics. We then describe an implementation of CLC that allows for controlling the level of imprecision in model responses. Results demonstrate our method produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual accuracy. Further, our approach enables fine-tuning models to perform uncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting, offering a controllable balance between factuality and specificity.

<title>Flexible Prefrontal Control over Hippocampal Episodic Memory for Goal-Directed Generalization</title>

Abstract: Many tasks require flexibly modifying perception and behavior based on current goals. Humans can retrieve episodic memories from days to years ago, using them to contextualize and generalize behaviors across novel but structurally related situations. The brain's ability to control episodic memories based on task demands is often attributed to interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). We propose a reinforcement learning model that incorporates a PFC-HPC interaction mechanism for goal-directed generalization. In our model, the PFC learns to generate query-key representations to encode and retrieve goal-relevant episodic memories, modulating HPC memories top-down based on current task demands. Moreover, the PFC adapts its encoding and retrieval strategies dynamically when faced with multiple goals presented in a blocked, rather than interleaved, manner. Our results show that: (1) combining working memory with selectively retrieved episodic memory allows transfer of decisions among similar environments or situations, (2) top-down control from PFC over HPC improves learning of arbitrary structural associations between events for generalization to novel environments compared to a bottom-up sensory-driven approach, and (3) the PFC encodes generalizable representations during both encoding and retrieval of goal-relevant memories, whereas the HPC exhibits event-specific representations. Together, these findings highlight the importance of goal-directed prefrontal control over hippocampal episodic memory for decision-making in novel situations and suggest a computational mechanism by which PFC-HPC interactions enable flexible behavior.

Abstract: On-robot Reinforcement Learning is a promising approach to train embodiment-aware policies for legged robots. However, the computational constraints of real-time learning on robots pose a significant challenge. We present a framework for efficiently learning quadruped locomotion in just 8 minutes of raw real-time training utilizing the sample efficiency and minimal computational overhead of the new off-policy algorithm CrossQ. We investigate two control architectures: Predicting joint target positions for agile, high-speed locomotion and Central Pattern Generators for stable, natural gaits. While prior work focused on learning simple forward gaits, our framework extends on-robot learning to omnidirectional locomotion. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in different indoor and outdoor environments.

Abstract: The Bayesian conjugate gradient method offers probabilistic solutions to linear systems but suffers from poor calibration, limiting its utility in uncertainty quantification tasks. Recent approaches leveraging postiterations to construct priors have improved computational properties but failed to correct calibration issues. In this work, we propose a novel randomised postiteration strategy that enhances the calibration of the BayesCG posterior while preserving its favourable convergence characteristics. We present theoretical guarantees for the improved calibration, supported by results on the distribution of posterior errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the method in both synthetic and inverse problem settings, showing enhanced uncertainty quantification and better propagation of uncertainties through computational pipelines.

arXiv:2504.12833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SPIE: a novel approach for semantic and structural post-training of instruction-based image editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in alignment with user prompts and consistency with input images. We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the alignment with instructions and realism in two ways. First, SPIE captures fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. Second, it achieves precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIE can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where targeted image edits enhance the visual realism of simulated environments, which improves their utility as proxy for real-world settings.

arXiv:2504.18273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning on large graphs presents significant challenges, with traditional Message Passing Neural Networks suffering from computational and memory costs scaling linearly with the number of edges. We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.

Abstract: Edge-cloud collaborative computing (ECCC) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing the computational demands of modern intelligent applications, integrating cloud resources with edge devices to enable efficient, low-latency processing. Recent advancements in AI, particularly deep learning and large language models (LLMs), have dramatically enhanced the capabilities of these distributed systems, yet introduce significant challenges in model deployment and resource management. In this survey, we comprehensive examine the intersection of distributed intelligence and model optimization within edge-cloud environments, providing a structured tutorial on fundamental architectures, enabling technologies, and emerging applications. Additionally, we systematically analyze model optimization approaches, including compression, adaptation, and neural architecture search, alongside AI-driven resource management strategies that balance performance, energy efficiency, and latency requirements. We further explore critical aspects of privacy protection and security enhancement within ECCC systems and examines practical deployments through diverse applications, spanning autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. Performance analysis and benchmarking techniques are also thoroughly explored to establish evaluation standards for these complex systems. Furthermore, the review identifies critical research directions including LLMs deployment, 6G integration, neuromorphic computing, and quantum computing, offering a roadmap for addressing persistent challenges in heterogeneity management, real-time processing, and scalability. By bridging theoretical advancements and practical deployments, this survey offers researchers and practitioners a holistic perspective on leveraging AI to optimize distributed computing environments, fostering innovation in next-generation intelligent systems.

<title>To Judge or not to Judge: Using LLM Judgements for Advertiser Keyphrase Relevance at eBay</title>

Abstract: E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.

arXiv:2505.06502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has revolutionised Super-Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure compared to conventional SR methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only 13% of training data is required to achieve performance similar to SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning by improving accuracy and efficiency, enhancing process understanding, and broadening applications to scientific research. We publicly release the complete source code of PC-SRGAN and all experiments at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/PC-SRGAN.

<title>Effort-aware Fairness: Incorporating a Philosophy-informed, Human-centered Notion of Effort into Algorithmic Fairness Metrics</title>

arXiv:2505.19317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although popularized AI fairness metrics, e.g., demographic parity, have uncovered bias in AI-assisted decision-making outcomes, they do not consider how much effort one has spent to get to where one is today in the input feature space. However, the notion of effort is important in how Philosophy and humans understand fairness. We propose a philosophy-informed approach to conceptualize and evaluate Effort-aware Fairness (EaF), grounded in the concept of Force, which represents the temporal trajectory of predictive features coupled with inertia. Besides theoretical formulation, our empirical contributions include: (1) a pre-registered human subjects experiment, which shows that for both stages of the (individual) fairness evaluation process, people consider the temporal trajectory of a predictive feature more than its aggregate value; (2) pipelines to compute Effort-aware Individual/Group Fairness in the criminal justice and personal finance contexts. Our work may enable AI model auditors to uncover and potentially correct unfair decisions against individuals who have spent significant efforts to improve but are still stuck with systemic disadvantages outside their control.

<title>Do LLMs Really Forget? Evaluating Unlearning with Knowledge Correlation and Confidence Awareness</title>

arXiv:2506.05735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

Abstract: Submodular functions, defined on continuous or discrete domains, arise in numerous applications. We study the minimization of the difference of two submodular (DS) functions, over both domains, extending prior work restricted to set functions. We show that all functions on discrete domains and all smooth functions on continuous domains are DS. For discrete domains, we observe that DS minimization is equivalent to minimizing the difference of two convex (DC) functions, as in the set function case. We propose a novel variant of the DC Algorithm (DCA) and apply it to the resulting DC Program, obtaining comparable theoretical guarantees as in the set function case. The algorithm can be applied to continuous domains via discretization. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and integer least squares.

<title>Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy</title>

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and organ-at-risk overdosing. Treatment replanning is often required to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning process as a reinforcement learning problem where agents learn control policies to adjust optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based approaches, our framework trains agents for each patient using their planning Computed Tomography (CT) and augmented anatomies simulating anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific approach leverages anatomical similarities along the treatment course, enabling effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments. Evaluation on eight HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed that both agents improved initial plan scores from $120.78 \pm 17.18$ to $139.59 \pm 5.50$ (DQN) and $141.50 \pm 4.69$ (PPO), surpassing the replans manually generated by a human planner ($136.32 \pm 4.79$). Clinical validation confirms that improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse anatomical changes. This work highlights DRL's potential in addressing geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton therapy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining their internal, parametric knowledge with external, non-parametric sources, with the goal of improving factual correctness and minimizing hallucinations. The LiveRAG 2025 challenge explores RAG solutions to maximize accuracy on DataMorgana's QA pairs, which are composed of single-hop and multi-hop questions. The challenge provides access to sparse OpenSearch and dense Pinecone indices of the Fineweb 10BT dataset. It restricts model use to LLMs with up to 10B parameters and final answer generation with Falcon-3-10B. A judge-LLM assesses the submitted answers along with human evaluators. By exploring distinct retriever combinations and RAG solutions under the challenge conditions, our final solution emerged using InstructRAG in combination with a Pinecone retriever and a BGE reranker. Our solution achieved a correctness score of 1.13 and a faithfulness score of 0.55 in the non-human evaluation, placing it overall in third place in the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However, challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function, enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46, highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

arXiv:2507.03789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern sequential recommender systems commonly use transformer-based models for next-item prediction. While these models demonstrate a strong balance between efficiency and quality, integrating interleaving features - such as the query context (e.g., browse category) under which next-item interactions occur - poses challenges. Effectively capturing query context is crucial for refining ranking relevance and enhancing user engagement, as it provides valuable signals about user intent within a session. Unlike item features, historical query context is typically not aligned with item sequences and may be unavailable at inference due to privacy constraints or feature store limitations - making its integration into transformers both challenging and error-prone. This paper analyzes different strategies for incorporating query context into transformers trained with a causal language modeling procedure as a case study. We propose a new method that effectively fuses the item sequence with query context within the attention mechanism. Through extensive offline and online experiments on a large-scale online platform and open datasets, we present evidence that our proposed method is an effective approach for integrating query context to improve model ranking quality in terms of relevance and diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

Abstract: Organic reaction, the foundation of modern chemical industry, is crucial for new material development and drug discovery. However, deciphering reaction mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core, Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes 3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a 3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10 datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions. This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism understanding.

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational complexity of important information while retaining complete information, achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings. Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods. Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability effectively.

HiTeC is a new framework for self-supervised learning on text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs), addressing limitations of existing methods. It introduces a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning approach with semantic-aware data augmentation to improve representation quality. The first stage pre-trains the text encoder with a structure-aware contrastive objective to capture correlations between text and hypergraph topology. The second stage introduces semantic-aware augmentation strategies to enhance informative view generation. A multi-scale contrastive loss is proposed to capture long-range dependencies by extending existing objectives. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph contrastive learning, HiTeC improves scalability without compromising representation quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. <div>

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels. However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology, resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap, we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of HiTeC.

<div> Thompson sampling, best arm identification, bandit framework, exponential models, computationally efficient<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
This article addresses the fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI) problem in bandit frameworks, focusing on single-parameter exponential models. Traditional BAI policies often involve significant computational overhead or exploration requirements, complicating real-world implementation. The proposed policy combines Thompson sampling with the best challenger rule, offering a novel approach that balances exploration and exploitation efficiently. It demonstrates asymptotic optimality for two-armed bandit problems and near optimality for general cases with three or more arms. Empirical evaluations showcase its competitive performance in terms of sample complexity and computational cost, underscoring its practical advantages. The concept of $\beta$-optimality is highlighted as a relaxed notion of asymptotic optimality, providing additional insights into policy comparisons and analysis. <div>

Abstract: This paper studies the fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI) problem in the bandit framework in the canonical single-parameter exponential models. For this problem, many policies have been proposed, but most of them require solving an optimization problem at every round and/or are forced to explore an arm at least a certain number of times except those restricted to the Gaussian model. To address these limitations, we propose a novel policy that combines Thompson sampling with a computationally efficient approach known as the best challenger rule. While Thompson sampling was originally considered for maximizing the cumulative reward, we demonstrate that it can be used to naturally explore arms in BAI without forcing it. We show that our policy is asymptotically optimal for any two-armed bandit problems and achieves near optimality for general $K$-armed bandit problems for $K\geq 3$. Nevertheless, in numerical experiments, our policy shows competitive performance compared to asymptotically optimal policies in terms of sample complexity while requiring less computation cost. In addition, we highlight the advantages of our policy by comparing it to the concept of $\beta$-optimality, a relaxed notion of asymptotic optimality commonly considered in the analysis of a class of policies including the proposed one.

Summary: SpectrumFM is proposed as a spectrum foundation model to improve spectrum cognition. It incorporates a spectrum encoder utilizing convolutional neural networks and multi-head self attention mechanisms to capture fine-grained local structures and global dependencies in spectrum data. Self-supervised learning tasks such as masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction are used for pre-training, enhancing the model's adaptability. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning allows SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to different spectrum cognition tasks like spectrum sensing, anomaly detection, and wireless technology classification. Experimental results show significant improvements over existing methods, with a 30% increase in detection probability for spectrum sensing, over 10% boost in area under the curve for anomaly detection, and a 9.6% enhancement in wireless technology classification accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.

The article discusses the discrete-time Schrödinger bridge problem on a finite state space and focuses on the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) algorithm's convergence. While previous knowledge confirmed the convergence of IMF to the ground truth solution, this study quantifies the speed of convergence for the first time.

Abstract: We consider the discrete-time Schr\"odinger bridge problem on a finite state space. Although it has been known that the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) algorithm converges in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the ground truth solution, the speed of that convergence remained unquantified. In this work, we establish for the first time that IMF exhibits exponential convergence with an explicit contraction factor.

Summary: 
This study focuses on the importance of providing sellers on eBay with relevant keyphrase recommendations to improve advertising campaign performance. To address biases in click data and enhance the accuracy of keyphrase suggestions, a two-step LLM distillation process is introduced. By training a bi-encoder model using a multi-task approach, knowledge is distilled from an LLM teacher through a cross-encoder assistant to improve the retrieval of relevant keyphrases. The study demonstrates that integrating LLM distillation in a multi-task training setup can enhance the performance of the bi-encoder model in recommending keyphrases for advertisers on eBay. By aligning seller and search judgments, this approach aims to mitigate the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintain a positive perception of sellers on eBay. <div>

Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions. Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

<div> Keywords: survival, self-organizing survival manifolds, geodesic flows, biological constraints, geometric phase transitions<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new approach to modeling survival that challenges traditional supervised learning methods. The authors propose that survival is not an externally annotated target but rather an emergent property of biological state space. They develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival Manifolds (SOSM), where survival dynamics arise from low-curvature geodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A survival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is introduced to induce structures aligning prognosis with geometric flow stability. The framework connects survival modeling to physical laws, including thermodynamics, entropy flow, Ricci curvature, and optimal transport. Health, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions within the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free foundation for survival modeling, bridging machine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Survival is traditionally modeled as a supervised learning task, reliant on curated outcome labels and fixed covariates. This work rejects that premise. It proposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric consequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in biological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival Manifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature geodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A survival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is introduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric flow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective and prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of survival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The framework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci curvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law. Health, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions in the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free foundation for modeling survival as a property of form, not annotation-bridging machine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself.

Abstract: Detecting fraud in modern supply chains is a growing challenge, driven by the complexity of global networks and the scarcity of labeled data. Traditional detection methods often struggle with class imbalance and limited supervision, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel two-phase learning framework to address these challenges. In the first phase, the Isolation Forest algorithm performs unsupervised anomaly detection to identify potential fraud cases and reduce the volume of data requiring further analysis. In the second phase, a self-training Support Vector Machine (SVM) refines the predictions using both labeled and high-confidence pseudo-labeled samples, enabling robust semi-supervised learning. The proposed method is evaluated on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset, a comprehensive real-world supply chain dataset with fraud indicators. It achieves an F1-score of 0.817 while maintaining a false positive rate below 3.0%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of combining unsupervised pre-filtering with semi-supervised refinement for supply chain fraud detection under real-world constraints, though we acknowledge limitations regarding concept drift and the need for comparison with deep learning approaches.

Summary: 
Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology due to class imbalance among interaction types. Existing predictive models struggle with rare but critical interaction types, leading to poor performance on infrequent cases. This study proposes a novel framework that combines Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE) to address this issue. By generating synthetic samples for rare classes, the model achieves better balance, improves predictive performance across interaction types, and ensures better clinical reliability. This approach enhances the effectiveness and novelty of DDI predictions by considering class-specific nuances, thereby reducing bias towards frequent interactions. Overall, the integration of GFlowNet and VGAE offers a promising solution to enhance DDI prediction accuracy and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology, with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness of predictive models. Common interactions dominate datasets, while rare but critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as a binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward frequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE) to generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.

Summary:
HGMN is introduced as a novel hypergraph neural network that integrates role-aware representations into graph neural networks and a state space model. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging hypergraph construction techniques, combining role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable transformer mechanism. By utilizing two hypergraph construction methods based on node degree and neighborhood levels, HGMN strengthens connections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing representational power. Incorporating hypergraph convolution layers allows the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph structures. To address over-smoothing, a residual network is included for improved stability and feature propagation across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate HGMN's superiority in node classification tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art GNN methods and highlighting its versatility and power for various graph-based learning applications.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes, often overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for learning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing role-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively integrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN utilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships and combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable mamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction methods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the connections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's representational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution layers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph structures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we incorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature propagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly introduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These results highlight HGMN's ability to provide enriched node representations by effectively embedding role-based features alongside adjacency information, making it a versatile and powerful tool for a variety of graph-based learning applications.

Summary: 
This paper addresses the issue of codebook collapse in Vector Quantization (VQ) applied to graph data. The study shows that codebook collapse is consistent in graph VQ due to early assignment imbalances and optimization loops. To tackle this, the authors propose RGVQ, a framework that incorporates graph topology and feature similarity to enhance codebook utilization. RGVQ introduces soft assignments using Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization and includes structure-aware contrastive regularization to penalize token co-assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that RGVQ significantly improves codebook utilization and enhances the performance of graph VQ backbones across various tasks, leading to more expressive and transferable graph token representations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to penalize the token co-assignments among similar node pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable graph token representations.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems play a crucial role in analyzing neuroimaging data for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, small-sample studies suffer from low reproducibility, while large-scale datasets introduce confounding heterogeneity due to multiple disease subtypes being labeled under a single category. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated learning framework tailored for neuroimaging CAD systems. Our approach includes a dynamic navigation module that routes samples to the most suitable local models based on latent subtype representations, and a meta-integration module that combines predictions from heterogeneous local models into a unified diagnostic output. We evaluated our framework using a comprehensive dataset comprising fMRI data from over 1300 MDD patients and 1100 healthy controls across multiple study cohorts. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods. Specifically, our framework achieved an average accuracy of 74.06\% across all tested sites, showcasing its effectiveness in handling subtype heterogeneity and enhancing model generalizability. Ablation studies further confirmed the importance of both the dynamic navigation and meta-integration modules in improving performance. By addressing data heterogeneity and subtype confounding, our framework advances reliable and reproducible neuroimaging CAD systems, offering significant potential for personalized medicine and clinical decision-making in neurology and psychiatry.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple 6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI systems.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new perspective on the phases of data distributions in generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by statistical physics. It emphasizes the importance of considering the spatial structure of real-life data, such as images, and proposes a method to construct local denoisers with reduced computational costs. By defining data distribution phases based on mutual connectivity via local operations, the study reveals an early trivial phase, a late data phase, and a rapid phase transition where local denoisers may fail. An information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers is derived, providing insights for designing more efficient architectures for diffusion models. The findings suggest using small local neural networks away from phase transition points and global networks only during phase transitions.

Abstract: As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions, which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers. Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions, the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new scaling law for large language models that can be applied to both dense and sparse architectures. With the exponential growth in model size and training costs, the need for efficient training techniques has become paramount. Existing scaling laws have primarily been specific to certain architectures, but this proposed generalized scaling law aims to provide a unified framework. By evaluating and comparing this new scaling law with existing ones, the authors showcase its effectiveness in optimizing the prediction of model size and resource allocation. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency of training large language models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Over the past few years, the size of language models has grown exponentially, as has the computational cost to train these large models. This rapid growth has motivated researchers to develop new techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the training process. Despite these advancements, optimally predicting the model size or allocating optimal resources remains a challenge. Several efforts have addressed the challenge by proposing different scaling laws, but almost all of them are architecture-specific (dense or sparse). In this work we revisit existing scaling laws and propose a generalized scaling law to provide a unified framework that is applicable to both dense and sparse large language models. We evaluate and compare our proposed scaling law with existing scaling laws to demonstrate its effectiveness.

<div> Keywords: ANTIDOTE, learning under noisy labels, adversarial training, label noise, time complexity 

Summary:
ANTIDOTE is a new approach for learning under noisy labels, using a relaxation over an information-divergence neighborhood. It is formulated as an adversarial training method with similar computational cost to standard cross-entropy loss. ANTIDOTE adaptively reduces the influence of samples with noisy labels, behaving like forgetting those samples during learning. Effective in practical environments with label noise or adversarial label alterations, ANTIDOTE outperforms leading losses in the field on various types of label noise. Empirical evaluations show its superiority and time complexity close to standard cross entropy loss. Overall, ANTIDOTE offers a promising solution for learning under challenging conditions of noisy labels, demonstrating improved performance and efficient training.

ANTIDOTE proves effective in practical scenarios with label noise or adversarial label modifications, showcasing superior performance and promising potential for improved learning outcomes. <div>
arXiv:2508.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ANTIDOTE, a new class of objectives for learning under noisy labels which are defined in terms of a relaxation over an information-divergence neighborhood. Using convex duality, we provide a reformulation as an adversarial training method that has similar computational cost to training with standard cross-entropy loss. We show that our approach adaptively reduces the influence of the samples with noisy labels during learning, exhibiting a behavior that is analogous to forgetting those samples. ANTIDOTE is effective in practical environments where label noise is inherent in the training data or where an adversary can alter the training labels. Extensive empirical evaluations on different levels of symmetric, asymmetric, human annotation, and real-world label noise show that ANTIDOTE outperforms leading comparable losses in the field and enjoys a time complexity that is very close to that of the standard cross entropy loss.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel multimodal approach for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using longitudinal diagnosis code histories and laboratory measurements from electronic health records. The proposed method combines neural controlled differential equations, pretrained language models, and recurrent networks to model irregular lab time series and learn diagnosis code trajectory representations. By incorporating cross-attention mechanisms, interactions between the two modalities are captured. The approach is evaluated on a dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and demonstrates significant improvements in AUC compared to state-of-the-art methods, ranging from 6.5% to 15.5%. Additionally, the model identifies specific diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including established and new biomarkers.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

This new study explores the use of large language models for generating synthetic data in computational social science research. By introducing a new estimator based on the generalized method of moments, the researchers provide a hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees. Surprisingly, they find that interactions between the moment residuals of synthetic and real data can improve estimates of the target parameter. Empirical validation across various regression tasks in computational social science applications shows significant gains in finite-sample performance. This innovative approach offers a promising way to combine synthetic and real data to draw statistically valid conclusions, opening new possibilities for research in limited data regimes. <div>
arXiv:2508.06635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being explored as an aid to computational social science and human subject research in limited data regimes. While previous technical work has explored the potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate entirely new synthetic samples (also termed as synthetic simulations), such as in responses to surveys. However, it is not immediately clear by what means practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this work, we introduce a new estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address the challenge at hand. Surprisingly, we find that interactions between the moment residuals of synthetic data and those of real data can improve estimates of the target parameter. We empirically validate the finite-sample performance of our estimator across different regression tasks in computational social science applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.

Summary: 
The article introduces two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks, Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments (MACS), to address the challenges of anomaly detection in nonstationary environments where statistical properties shift over time. Traditional static thresholds are not effective in such scenarios where regime shifts, concept drift, or multi-scale changes can occur. The new frameworks leverage statistical online learning and segmentation principles for contextually sensitive adaptation, ensuring false alarm rates are maintained even under evolving distributions. Experimental results on Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant improvement in F1-score compared to traditional approaches like percentiles and rolling quantiles. The study illustrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of various real-world anomalies.

Abstract: As time series data become increasingly prevalent in domains such as manufacturing, IT, and infrastructure monitoring, anomaly detection must adapt to nonstationary environments where statistical properties shift over time. Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts, concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks: Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.

<div> Keywords: Language Models, Transformers, Encoding, Universal Sequence Maps, Genomic Sequences

Summary:<br />
- The article discusses the encoding procedures that represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales using Language Models and Transformers, specifically focusing on Universal Sequence Maps (USM).
- USM is a bijective fractal encoding method that encodes symbolic sequences onto numerical spaces, allowing for the computation of Chebyshev distance metric and k-mer frequencies.
- The report addresses seeding biases in the USM process, leading to the reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity and revealing USM as an efficient numeric process converging towards a steady state sequence embedding solution.
- The study primarily examines genomic sequences due to the ease of representation with a 4-token alphabet (nucleotides), but the application to sequences with varying alphabets is also feasible.
- The results highlight the significance of USM in capturing contextual information in symbolic sequences and provide insights into its iterative nature and convergence properties.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers, popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and, paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process. The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity; and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless, the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be straightforward.

Summary:<br />
This work introduces the CORAL framework for improving agents' in-context RL abilities by decoupling latent representation learning from control. It formulates ICRL as a two-agent communication problem, with an Information Agent (IA) pre-trained on diverse tasks to build a world model and distill understanding into concise messages. A Causal Influence Loss shapes the communication protocol by measuring the message's effect on the next action. The IA then serves as a contextualizer for a Control Agent (CA) during deployment, enabling the CA to interpret the communicative context and achieve significant gains in sample efficiency. The CA can successfully perform zero-shot adaptation in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, demonstrating the efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.

Summary:
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have limitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on graph connectivity. A recent architecture, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), offers strong nonlinear expressiveness and efficient inference. This work integrates KANs into popular GNN architectures (such as GAT, SGC, and APPNP) to create new models (KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP). A multi-teacher knowledge amalgamation framework is also utilized, where knowledge from multiple KAN-based GNNs is distilled into a graph-independent KAN student model. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed models enhance node classification accuracy, and the knowledge amalgamation approach notably improves the student model's performance. These findings underscore the potential of KANs in enhancing GNN expressiveness and enabling efficient, graph-free inference.

Summary:
Discrete Cosine Transform-based Activation Watermarking (DCT-AW) is introduced as a novel watermarking method tailored for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), which have learnable activation functions. This method perturbs activation outputs using discrete cosine transform to embed watermarks, ensuring compatibility with various tasks and achieving task independence. Experimental results show that DCT-AW has minimal impact on model performance and provides superior robustness against watermark removal attacks, such as fine-tuning, pruning, and retraining after pruning. The increasing importance of protecting intellectual property in machine learning has led to significant attention on watermarking techniques. While existing methods are effective for traditional deep neural networks, they often struggle to adapt to the unique architecture of KAN. Therefore, DCT-AW fills this gap by offering a solution specifically designed for KAN, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in model protection.

Abstract: With the increasing importance of protecting intellectual property in machine learning, watermarking techniques have gained significant attention. As advanced models are increasingly deployed in domains such as social network analysis, the need for robust model protection becomes even more critical. While existing watermarking methods have demonstrated effectiveness for conventional deep neural networks, they often fail to adapt to the novel architecture, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), which feature learnable activation functions. KAN holds strong potential for modeling complex relationships in network-structured data. However, their unique design also introduces new challenges for watermarking. Therefore, we propose a novel watermarking method, Discrete Cosine Transform-based Activation Watermarking (DCT-AW), tailored for KAN. Leveraging the learnable activation functions of KAN, our method embeds watermarks by perturbing activation outputs using discrete cosine transform, ensuring compatibility with diverse tasks and achieving task independence. Experimental results demonstrate that DCT-AW has a small impact on model performance and provides superior robustness against various watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and retraining after pruning.

Summary: 
The article introduces the HeteRo-Select framework for improving training stability in Federated Learning (FL). By selecting a smart subset of clients based on factors like usefulness, fairness, update speed, and data variety, HeteRo-Select aims to maintain high performance throughout the training process. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that selecting a subset of clients can reduce communication more effectively in cases of high heterogeneity in client data. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset with significant label skew show that HeteRo-Select outperforms existing methods in terms of peak accuracy, final accuracy, and training stability. With a peak accuracy of 74.75%, final accuracy of 72.76%, and minimal stability drop of 1.99%, HeteRo-Select proves to be a reliable solution for real-world heterogeneous FL problems. <div>
arXiv:2508.06692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that often suffers from training instability due to the diverse nature of client data. Although utility-based client selection methods like Oort are used to converge by prioritizing high-loss clients, they frequently experience significant drops in accuracy during later stages of training. We propose a theoretical HeteRo-Select framework designed to maintain high performance and ensure long-term training stability. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that when client data is very different (high heterogeneity), choosing a smart subset of client participation can reduce communication more effectively compared to full participation. Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear, step-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update speed, and data variety. It also shows convergence guarantees under strong regularization. Our experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset under significant label skew ($\alpha=0.1$) support the theoretical findings. The HeteRo-Select method performs better than existing approaches in terms of peak accuracy, final accuracy, and training stability. Specifically, HeteRo-Select achieves a peak accuracy of $74.75\%$, a final accuracy of $72.76\%$, and a minimal stability drop of $1.99\%$. In contrast, Oort records a lower peak accuracy of $73.98\%$, a final accuracy of $71.25\%$, and a larger stability drop of $2.73\%$. The theoretical foundations and empirical performance in our study make HeteRo-Select a reliable solution for real-world heterogeneous FL problems.

Summary:
CISO is a deep learning-based method for species distribution modeling that addresses the challenge of incorporating incomplete biotic information. It allows for predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number of species observations alongside environmental variables. The method improves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets by including partial biotic information. CISO outperforms alternative methods when conditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset. Additionally, combining observations from multiple datasets can further enhance performance. This approach is a promising ecological tool that can identify potential interactions between species from different taxa, making it valuable for conservation planning and ecological research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict species' geographic distributions, serving as critical tools for ecological research and conservation planning. Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to environmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also strongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often overlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by incorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise relationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In practice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information about the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across locations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based method for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species Observations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number of species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the variability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our approach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen for plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for butterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information improves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When conditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms alternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species. Furthermore, we show that combining observations from multiple datasets can improve performance. CISO is a promising ecological tool, capable of incorporating incomplete biotic information and identifying potential interactions between species from disparate taxa.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Schedule-Free (SF) method for first-order methods in large-scale learning algorithms with hyperparameters that are independent of the total horizon $T$. A robust Lyapunov framework is presented for analyzing SF in nonconvex settings, providing horizon-agnostic bounds. The analysis yields rates of $O(1/\log T)$ for constant step + PR averaging, $O(\log T/T)$ for linearly growing step-size, and a continuum of $O(T^{-(1-\alpha)})$ rates for polynomial averaging. The authors validate these rates through Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) experiments. The study extends SF's horizon-free guarantees to smooth nonconvex optimization, suggesting a potential improvement in the $O(1/\log T)$ bound to $O(1/T). The work paves the way for optimal nonconvex rates in the future. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order methods underpin most large-scale learning algorithms, yet their classical convergence guarantees hinge on carefully scheduled step-sizes that depend on the total horizon $T$, which is rarely known in advance. The Schedule-Free (SF) method promises optimal performance with hyperparameters that are independent of $T$ by interpolating between Polyak--Ruppert averaging and momentum, but nonconvex analysis of SF has been limited or reliant on strong global assumptions. We introduce a robust Lyapunov framework that, under only $L$-smoothness and lower-boundedness, reduces SF analysis to a single-step descent inequality. This yields horizon-agnostic bounds in the nonconvex setting: $O(1/\log T)$ for constant step + PR averaging, $O(\log T/T)$ for a linearly growing step-size, and a continuum of $O(T^{-(1-\alpha)})$ rates for polynomial averaging. We complement these proofs with Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) experiments that numerically validate our rates and suggest that our $O(1/\log T)$ bound on the original nonconvex SF algorithm may tighten to $O(1/T)$. Our work extends SF's horizon-free guarantees to smooth nonconvex optimization and charts future directions for optimal nonconvex rates.

<div> Keywords: Collaborative fine-tuning, large language models, federated learning, mobile devices, model heterogeneity

Summary:
Fed MobiLLM introduces a novel approach for efficient federated fine-tuning of large language models on heterogeneous mobile devices. It utilizes a server-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm where mobile devices perform lightweight computations on local data using pre-scaled backbone models and upload selected activations for server training. This eliminates client-side backpropagation and allows for asynchronous updates. An adaptive layer-wise feature alignment method ensures consistent representations for collaboratively tuning a shared side network across different devices. Experimental results show that Fed MobiLLM achieves robust fine-tuning performance with significantly reduced computation overhead, communication costs, and faster convergence compared to existing methods, making it suitable for practical adaptation of large language models on mobile devices.

Abstract: Collaboratively fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) over heterogeneous mobile devices fosters immense potential applications of personalized intelligence. However, such a vision faces critical system challenges. Conventional federated LLM FT approaches place prohibitive computational and memory burdens on mobile hardware, and their synchronous model aggregation protocols stall for slower devices. In this paper, we propose Fed MobiLLM, a novel design to facilitate efficient federated LLM FT across mobile devices with diverse computing/communication speeds and local model architectures. In particular, Fed MobiLLM implements a pioneering server-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm. Briefly, mobile devices perform lightweight forward propagation computations on local data using their frozen pre-scaled backbone LLMs, and then upload selected intermediate activations. The server trains a shared side-network independently, eliminating client-side backpropagation and enabling asynchronous updates. To bridge model heterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise feature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for collaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while achieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in computation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster convergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical LLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices.

Summary: 
The Zero-Direction Probing (ZDP) framework introduces a novel approach for detecting model drift without the need for task labels or output evaluations. By examining the null directions of transformer activations, ZDP offers concrete guarantees on representational change. Key results include the Variance-Leak Theorem, Fisher Null-Conservation, and a Rank-Leak bound for low-rank updates. Additionally, ZDP provides a logarithmic-regret guarantee for online null-space trackers. The framework introduces a Spectral Null-Leakage (SNL) metric with non-asymptotic tail bounds and concentration inequalities, allowing for a-priori thresholds for drift detection under a Gaussian null model. By monitoring the right and left null spaces of layer activations and their Fisher geometry, ZDP offers a reliable method for assessing model drift and representational changes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Summary: <br />
Alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial to ensure adherence to human values, but the use of human feedback raises privacy concerns. This work introduces PROPS, a privacy-preserving alignment framework that focuses on preserving the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. PROPS progresses through multiple stages of alignment, where privately aligned models in previous stages serve as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages. The framework provides theoretical guarantees and is validated using various models and datasets, demonstrating higher utility compared to existing methods while maintaining high privacy levels. For the same privacy budget, PROPS achieves significantly higher win-rates in alignment compared to Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD) and Randomized Response (RR) based alignment methods. <div>

Abstract: Alignment is a key step in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) using human feedback to ensure adherence to human values and societal norms. Dependence on human feedback raises privacy concerns about how much a labeler's preferences may reveal about their personal values, beliefs, and personality traits. Existing approaches, such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD), provide rigorous privacy guarantees by privatizing gradients during fine-tuning and alignment but can provide more privacy than necessary as human preferences are tied only to labels of (prompt, response) pairs and can degrade model utility. This work focuses on LLM alignment with preference-level privacy, which preserves the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. We propose PROPS (PROgressively Private Self-alignment), a multi-stage privacy preserving alignment framework where privately aligned models in previous stages can serve as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages of alignment. We present theoretical guarantees for PROPS as well as comprehensive validation using multiple models (Pythia and GPT) and datasets (AlpacaEval, Anthropic HH-RLHF, truthy-dpo-v0.1) to demonstrate the utility of PROPS over existing methods while still providing high privacy. For the same privacy budget, alignment via PROPS can achieve up to 3x higher win-rates compared to DP-SGD, and 2.5x higher win-rates compared to Randomized Response (RR) based alignment.

<div> Keywords: high-dimensional data, self-supervised learning, tensor networks, Tucker decomposition, non-linear framework

Summary:
The article introduces the Mode-Aware Non-linear Tucker Autoencoder (MA-NTAE) to address challenges in self-supervised learning with high-dimensional data. Traditional autoencoders face issues with large model sizes and computational overhead, while existing tensor networks struggle with learning non-linear relationships. MA-NTAE extends Tucker decomposition to a non-linear framework and employs a Pick-and-Unfold strategy for encoding high-order tensors in a flexible manner. It integrates tensor structural priors effectively and exhibits computational complexity growth proportional to mode dimensions. Experimental results show MA-NTAE outperforms standard autoencoders and current tensor networks in compression and clustering tasks, especially for higher-order tensors. This innovation offers an efficient solution for deep structural feature capture in high-dimensional data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional data, particularly in the form of high-order tensors, presents a major challenge in self-supervised learning. While MLP-based autoencoders (AE) are commonly employed, their dependence on flattening operations exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, leading to excessively large model sizes, high computational overhead, and challenging optimization for deep structural feature capture. Although existing tensor networks alleviate computational burdens through tensor decomposition techniques, most exhibit limited capability in learning non-linear relationships. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Mode-Aware Non-linear Tucker Autoencoder (MA-NTAE). MA-NTAE generalized classical Tucker decomposition to a non-linear framework and employs a Pick-and-Unfold strategy, facilitating flexible per-mode encoding of high-order tensors via recursive unfold-encode-fold operations, effectively integrating tensor structural priors. Notably, MA-NTAE exhibits linear growth in computational complexity with tensor order and proportional growth with mode dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate MA-NTAE's performance advantages over standard AE and current tensor networks in compression and clustering tasks, which become increasingly pronounced for higher-order, higher-dimensional tensors.

<div> Keywords: missing modalities, multimodal emotion recognition, hardness-aware dynamic curriculum learning, reconstruction difficulty, benchmark datasets

Summary: 
The article introduces HARDY-MER, a novel framework for multimodal emotion recognition that addresses missing modalities by incorporating hardness-aware dynamic curriculum learning. This framework operates in two stages: estimating the hardness level of each sample and strategically emphasizing hard samples during training. The Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism quantifies difficulty using both Direct Hardness (modality reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information). The Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving similar samples and balancing focus between easy and hard instances. Extensive experiments show HARDY-MER outperforms existing methods in missing-modality scenarios, with code available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Missing modalities have recently emerged as a critical research direction in multimodal emotion recognition (MER). Conventional approaches typically address this issue through missing modality reconstruction. However, these methods fail to account for variations in reconstruction difficulty across different samples, consequently limiting the model's ability to handle hard samples effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hardness-Aware Dynamic Curriculum Learning framework, termed HARDY-MER. Our framework operates in two key stages: first, it estimates the hardness level of each sample, and second, it strategically emphasizes hard samples during training to enhance model performance on these challenging instances. Specifically, we first introduce a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies reconstruction difficulty by considering both Direct Hardness (modality reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information). Meanwhile, we introduce a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy that dynamically adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving samples with similar semantic information and balancing the learning focus between easy and hard instances. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HARDY-MER consistently outperforms existing methods in missing-modality scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HARDY-MER/HARDY-MER.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Data Augmentation, Offline-to-online, Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation, Performance Improvement <br />
Summary: 
Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) involves fine-tuning a pre-trained policy online while minimizing online interactions. Existing methods use offline datasets to augment data, but there is still a gap between generated and online data. To address this, a new approach called Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation (CFDG) is proposed. CFDG utilizes guidance diffusion without additional classifier training overhead to enhance data generation quality across different distributions. It employs reweighting to align more generated data with online data, improving performance and agent stability. Experimental results demonstrate CFDG outperforming other data generation methods. Integration of CFDG with popular RL algorithms results in a significant 15% average performance improvement on D4RL benchmarks like MuJoCo and AntMaze. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL, PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.

Summary:
This work addresses the challenge of adapting large language models (LLMs) to niche programming languages like Q, commonly used in quantitative finance but underrepresented online. The researchers introduce a new evaluation dataset for the Q language and train a suite of reasoning and non-reasoning models based on the Qwen-2.5 series with varying parameter sizes. Their best model achieves a pass@1 accuracy of 59%, outperforming existing models like Claude Opus-4 and GPT-4.1 on the Q benchmark task. The methodology, encompassing dataset construction, model pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, is released alongside the models, code, and data for reproducibility. The study demonstrates the potential of leveraging LLMs for specialized applications and provides insights on how these techniques can be extended to other tasks beyond programming languages with objective signals. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though large language models are becoming increasingly capable, it is still unreasonable to expect them to excel at tasks that are under-represented on the Internet. Leveraging LLMs for specialized applications, particularly in niche programming languages and private domains, remains challenging and largely unsolved. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a comprehensive, open-source approach for adapting LLMs to the Q programming language, a popular tool in quantitative finance that is much less present on the Internet compared to Python, C, Java, and other ``mainstream" languages and is therefore not a strong suit of general-purpose AI models. We introduce a new Leetcode style evaluation dataset for Q, benchmark major frontier models on the dataset, then do pretraining, supervised fine tuning, and reinforcement learning to train a suite of reasoning and non-reasoning models based on the Qwen-2.5 series, spanning five parameter sizes (1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B). Our best model achieves a pass@1 accuracy of 59 percent on our Q benchmark, surpassing the best-performing frontier model, Claude Opus-4 by 29.5 percent. Additionally, all models, even our 1.5B model, outperform GPT-4.1 on this task. In addition to releasing models, code, and data, we provide a detailed blueprint for dataset construction, model pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. Our methodology is broadly applicable, and we discuss how these techniques can be extended to other tasks, including those where evaluation may rely on soft or subjective signals.

Summary: 
The study investigates the challenge of detecting hidden harmful behavior in neural networks. It frames the problem as an adversarial game between two teams – the red team training models on benign and harmful data, and the blue team identifying the compromised model. Various strategies are explored, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated gradients, and adversarial attacks. Adversarial-attack-based methods show promising results in accurately identifying the compromised model with hints. Limited to no information makes effective auditing in Large Language Models (LLMs) challenging, requiring hints about the undesired distribution. LLM auditing methods rely on a combination of black-box and open-weight methods to probe models and reveal misalignments. The research findings, along with open-sourced auditing games, aim to contribute to the development of better auditing techniques for neural networks. <div>
arXiv:2508.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods (100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds, we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.

Plasticity loss poses a challenge in deep reinforcement learning, especially in multi-task settings where adaptability is crucial. This study investigates the use of sparsification methods such as GMP and SET to improve plasticity in MTRL agents. Various MTRL architectures are evaluated on standardized benchmarks, showing that sparsity can enhance performance by mitigating indicators of plasticity degradation like neuron dormancy. Sparse agents often outperform dense ones and achieve competitive results without explicit plasticity interventions.

arXiv:2508.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasticity loss, a diminishing capacity to adapt as training progresses, is a critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning. We examine this issue in multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational flexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task demands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance plasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents. We evaluate these approaches across distinct MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) on standardized MTRL benchmarks, comparing against dense baselines, and a comprehensive range of alternative plasticity-inducing or regularization methods. Our results demonstrate that both GMP and SET effectively mitigate key indicators of plasticity degradation, such as neuron dormancy and representational collapse. These plasticity improvements often correlate with enhanced multi-task performance, with sparse agents frequently outperforming dense counterparts and achieving competitive results against explicit plasticity interventions. Our findings offer insights into the interplay between plasticity, network sparsity, and MTRL designs, highlighting dynamic sparsification as a robust but context-sensitive tool for developing more adaptable MTRL systems.

Abstract: Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms developed in the 1990's by Gammerman, Vovk, and their research team, to provide set predictions with guaranteed confidence level. Over recent years, they have grown in popularity and have become a mainstream methodology for uncertainty quantification in the machine learning community. From its beginning, there was an understanding that they enable reliable machine learning with well-calibrated uncertainty quantification. This makes them extremely beneficial for developing trustworthy AI, a topic that has also risen in interest over the past few years, in both the AI community and society more widely. In this article, we review the potential for conformal prediction to contribute to trustworthy AI beyond its marginal validity property, addressing problems such as generalization risk and AI governance. Experiments and examples are also provided to demonstrate its use as a well-calibrated predictor and for bias identification and mitigation.

This innovative approach offers a lightweight and modular solution for zero-shot time series forecasting, demonstrating the potential of combining efficient retrieval with representation learning for improved accuracy and adaptability in diverse forecasting scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting has become increasingly important to empower diverse applications with streaming data. Zero-shot time-series forecasting (ZSF), particularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios, such as domain transfer or forecasting under extreme conditions, is difficult for traditional models to deal with. While time series pre-trained models (TSPMs) have demonstrated strong performance in ZSF, they often lack mechanisms to dynamically incorporate external knowledge. Fortunately, emerging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising path for injecting such knowledge on demand, yet they are rarely integrated with TSPMs. To leverage the strengths of both worlds, we introduce RAG into TSPMs to enhance zero-shot time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series Forecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient retrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB) for scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and coarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation Coherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM based and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM based and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and 87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and inference time.

<div> Bias, Medical diagnosis, Class-feature bias, Cls-unbias, Generalization

Summary: 
This work addresses the issue of bias in medical diagnosis models, specifically focusing on class-feature bias. The study identifies that models may rely on features that are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased performance and poor generalization on other classes. To combat this, the researchers propose a class-unbiased model called Cls-unbias, which aims to mitigate class imbalance and class-feature bias simultaneously. They introduce a class-wise inequality loss to promote equal contributions of classification loss from positive and negative class samples. Moreover, they optimize a class-wise group distributionally robust optimization objective to enhance the effectiveness of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, the study demonstrates the negative impact of class-feature bias on model performance and shows that their proposed method effectively mitigates both class-feature bias and class imbalance, leading to improved generalization ability.

In this work, we identified class-feature bias, which refers to models' potential reliance on features that are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased performance and poor generalization on other classes. We aim to train a class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) that mitigates both class imbalance and class-feature bias simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a class-wise inequality loss which promotes equal contributions of classification loss from positive-class and negative-class samples. We propose to optimize a class-wise group distributionally robust optimization objective-a class-weighted training objective that upweights underperforming classes-to enhance the effectiveness of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through synthetic and real-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate that class-feature bias can negatively impact model performance. Our proposed method effectively mitigates both class-feature bias and class imbalance, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.

Summary: 
Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT) is a novel single-stage algorithm that optimally balances Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) through a learnable parameter. By treating SFT and RL as complementary reward signals, AMFT dynamically adjusts the balance to maximize long-term task performance. Regularized by policy entropy for stability, AMFT autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum, leading to state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning, and vision-language navigation. The meta-learning controller in AMFT plays a critical role in stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for Large Language Model alignment. The open-sourced codes for AMFT are available at https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

Summary: <br />
Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a technique used in large language models to fine-tune pretrained weight matrices efficiently. The Block Diversified Low-Rank Adaptation (BoRA) method proposed in this paper enhances the rank of LoRA weights with minimal additional parameters. By treating the weight product as a block matrix multiplication and introducing unique diagonal matrices for each block, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of the number of blocks used, while only requiring a small number of additional parameters. Experimental results across various datasets and models showcase the effectiveness of BoRA, and ablation studies confirm its scalability. <div>
arXiv:2508.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method widely used in large language models (LLMs). It approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix $W\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ by the product of two low-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \in\mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$ and $B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r} (r\ll\min\{m,n\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$ can raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves fine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank Adaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number of additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block matrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along the columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\dots,A_b]$ and $B=[B_1,\dots,B_b]^\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the concatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\in[b]$. To enhance the diversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix $\Sigma_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times r}$ for each block multiplication, resulting in $B_i \Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal matrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only requiring $b^2r$ additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models demonstrate the superiority of BoRA, and ablation studies further validate its scalability.

<div> Keywords: remote sensing, multimodal learning networks, multitask learning, interpretability, satellite data

Summary:
Multimodal learning networks leverage the diversity of satellite data for improved performance but lack interpretability. This study explores using multitask learning to explain model behavior by predicting certain modalities as additional targets along with the main task. The approach benefits from the information richness of satellite data, requiring no additional data collection at deployment and maintaining performance comparable to multimodal baselines. In some cases, it even outperforms them. Additionally, errors in the main task can be explained through the model's behavior in the auxiliary tasks. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated across three datasets involving segmentation, classification, and regression tasks. The code for this approach is available at git.opendfki.de/hiba.najjar/mtl_explainability/.

Abstract: Remote sensing provides satellite data in diverse types and formats. The usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior. In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation, classification, and regression tasks. Code available at git.opendfki.de/hiba.najjar/mtl_explainability/.

Abstract: We present a framework for constructing real-time digital twins based on structure-preserving reduced finite element models conditioned on a latent variable Z. The approach uses conditional attention mechanisms to learn both a reduced finite element basis and a nonlinear conservation law within the framework of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). This guarantees numerical well-posedness and exact preservation of conserved quantities, regardless of data sparsity or optimization error. The conditioning mechanism supports real-time calibration to parametric variables, allowing the construction of digital twins which support closed loop inference and calibration to sensor data. The framework interfaces with conventional finite element machinery in a non-invasive manner, allowing treatment of complex geometries and integration of learned models with conventional finite element techniques.
  Benchmarks include advection diffusion, shock hydrodynamics, electrostatics, and a complex battery thermal runaway problem. The method achieves accurate predictions on complex geometries with sparse data (25 LES simulations), including capturing the transition to turbulence and achieving real-time inference ~0.1s with a speedup of 3.1x10^8 relative to LES.

Summary: <br />
A new scientific machine-learning paradigm called Discovery Learning (DL) is introduced to accelerate battery design evaluation. DL integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning to reduce prototyping needs and improve efficiency in predicting battery lifetime. Testing DL on industrial lithium-ion pouch cells shows a 7.2% test error in predicting cycle life without additional data labeling. This approach saves 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to traditional practices. By learning from historical designs, DL enables rapid evaluation of novel material-design combinations, aiding in the development of next-generation battery technologies. This work demonstrates the potential of leveraging machine learning for efficient data-driven modeling in scientific discovery and engineering innovation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services. However, the inherent randomness, non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniMove/.

Summary: 
Feature Selection (FS) plays a crucial role in enhancing model interpretability, reducing complexity, and improving accuracy. This paper focuses on adapting and evaluating various FS techniques for the Tsetlin machine (TM), a model offering interpretable clause-based learning. The study includes classical filter and embedded methods, as well as post-hoc explanation methods like SHAP and LIME. Novel TM-specific scorers derived from TM clause weights and Tsetlin automaton (TA) states are also introduced. Benchmarking on 12 datasets using the ROAR and ROAD strategies shows that TM-internal scorers perform competitively, revealing interacting feature patterns through the interpretability of clauses. Additionally, simpler TM-specific scorers demonstrate similar accuracy retention at lower computational costs. This study establishes a comprehensive baseline for FS in TM and lays the groundwork for developing specialized TM-specific interpretability techniques.

Abstract: Feature Selection (FS) is crucial for improving model interpretability, reducing complexity, and sometimes for enhancing accuracy. The recently introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) offers interpretable clause-based learning, but lacks established tools for estimating feature importance. In this paper, we adapt and evaluate a range of FS techniques for TMs, including classical filter and embedded methods as well as post-hoc explanation methods originally developed for neural networks (e.g., SHAP and LIME) and a novel family of embedded scorers derived from TM clause weights and Tsetlin automaton (TA) states. We benchmark all methods across 12 datasets, using evaluation protocols, like Remove and Retrain (ROAR) strategy and Remove and Debias (ROAD), to assess causal impact. Our results show that TM-internal scorers not only perform competitively but also exploit the interpretability of clauses to reveal interacting feature patterns. Simpler TM-specific scorers achieve similar accuracy retention at a fraction of the computational cost. This study establishes the first comprehensive baseline for FS in TM and paves the way for developing specialized TM-specific interpretability techniques.

Abstract: Decision support systems are designed to assist human experts in classification tasks by providing conformal prediction sets derived from a pre-trained model. This human-AI collaboration has demonstrated enhanced classification performance compared to using either the model or the expert independently. In this study, we focus on the selection of instance-specific experts from a pool of multiple human experts, contrasting it with existing research that typically focuses on single-expert scenarios. We characterize the conditions under which multiple experts can benefit from the conformal sets. With the insight that only certain experts may be relevant for each instance, we explore the problem of subset selection and introduce a greedy algorithm that utilizes conformal sets to identify the subset of expert predictions that will be used in classifying an instance. This approach is shown to yield better performance compared to naive methods for human subset selection. Based on real expert predictions from the CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H datasets, our simulation study indicates that our proposed greedy algorithm achieves near-optimal subsets, resulting in improved classification performance among multiple experts.

Additionally, the contrastive learning approach reduces computational time by 99%, ensuring scalability and real-time applicability in various time series forecasting tasks. This framework presents a promising approach for enhancing forecasting accuracy by effectively incorporating time-lagged cross-correlated sequences.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical across various domains, such as weather, finance and real estate forecasting, as accurate forecasts support informed decision-making and risk mitigation. While recent deep learning models have improved predictive capabilities, they often overlook time-lagged cross-correlations between related sequences, which are crucial for capturing complex temporal relationships. To address this, we propose the Time-Lagged Cross-Correlations-based Sequence Prediction framework (TLCCSP), which enhances forecasting accuracy by effectively integrating time-lagged cross-correlated sequences. TLCCSP employs the Sequence Shifted Dynamic Time Warping (SSDTW) algorithm to capture lagged correlations and a contrastive learning-based encoder to efficiently approximate SSDTW distances.
  Experimental results on weather, finance and real estate time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. On the weather dataset, SSDTW reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 16.01% compared with single-sequence methods, while the contrastive learning encoder (CLE) further decreases MSE by 17.88%. On the stock dataset, SSDTW achieves a 9.95% MSE reduction, and CLE reduces it by 6.13%. For the real estate dataset, SSDTW and CLE reduce MSE by 21.29% and 8.62%, respectively. Additionally, the contrastive learning approach decreases SSDTW computational time by approximately 99%, ensuring scalability and real-time applicability across multiple time series forecasting tasks.

Summary:
The study addresses the challenge of learning robust driving policies in autonomous vehicles using large-scale, real-world datasets. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) provides a simple imitation learning approach, policies trained with BC are prone to errors. The researchers developed a series of BC baselines, including a Transformer-based model, which still struggled in long-horizon simulations. By applying the Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and architecture, a more robust policy was learned. The CQL agent, with a carefully engineered reward function, achieved significantly higher success and lower collision rates than the BC baseline in a large-scale evaluation on unseen scenarios. This demonstrates the importance of an offline RL approach in learning robust driving policies from static expert data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a 3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust, long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to model the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. It addresses challenges in longitudinal data scarcity and the complex interplay of pathological mechanisms by incorporating time-dependent expert weighting. The framework utilizes an iterative dual optimization method to estimate the temporal position of observations and constructs a cohort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots. It enhances the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural diffusion model (IGND) that varies diffusivity based on node states and time. Additionally, a localized neural reaction module captures complex dynamics beyond standard processes. The resulting model dynamically integrates components across temporal states, providing insights into stage-specific pathological mechanisms. The study suggests that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages, while other physical processes dominate later on. <div>
arXiv:2508.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term progression of neurodegenerative diseases is commonly conceptualized as a spatiotemporal diffusion process that consists of a graph diffusion process across the structural brain connectome and a localized reaction process within brain regions. However, modeling this progression remains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained through irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of pathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where traditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms dominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert weighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to properly estimate the temporal position of individual observations, constructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots. Model-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural diffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and time, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also introduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond standard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these components across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how stage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The stage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature, suggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages, while other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.

<div> Keywords: Learning-based filtering, noise-statistics drift, adaptive Kalman filtering, optimal transport, online adaptation

Summary:
OTAKNet proposes an online solution for handling noise-statistics drift in learning-based adaptive Kalman filtering. Unlike existing methods, OTAKNet utilizes optimal transport to address drift in noise statistics, allowing for online adaptation without the need for ground truth labels or retraining. The approach leverages optimal transport's geometry-aware cost and stable gradients to maintain performance in dynamic environments. Compared to classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline learning-based methods, OTAKNet demonstrates superior performance on synthetic and real-world datasets from the NCLT dataset, especially in situations with limited training data. This innovative approach shows promise for applications in non-linear dynamical systems where noise statistics can change due to environmental factors, ensuring robust and reliable performance over time.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based filtering has demonstrated strong performance in non-linear dynamical systems, particularly when the statistics of noise are unknown. However, in real-world deployments, environmental factors, such as changing wind conditions or electromagnetic interference, can induce unobserved noise-statistics drift, leading to substantial degradation of learning-based methods. To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online solution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman filtering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline fine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet establishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step predictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport. This leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully online adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet against classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline learning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Distillation, Large Language Models, Privacy Risks, NLP Tasks, Teacher-Student Model Relationship

Summary: 
This study explores the privacy risks associated with transferring knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to smaller student models using Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques. By analyzing the impact of different KD components and model configurations, the researchers demonstrate that all existing LLM KD approaches pose membership and memorization privacy risks from the teacher to the student models. The extent of these risks varies across different KD techniques, highlighting the need for careful consideration when implementing LLM KD. The study also reveals significant disparities between memorization and membership privacy risks in LLM KD techniques. Furthermore, the researchers find that privacy risks can differ significantly across different model blocks. This research provides valuable insights into the privacy implications of using KD to train LLMs and emphasizes the importance of enhancing privacy protections in the development and deployment of such models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Distillation (KD) aim to mitigate the high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by transferring knowledge from a large ''teacher'' to a smaller ''student'' model. However, students may inherit the teacher's privacy when the teacher is trained on private data. In this work, we systematically characterize and investigate membership and memorization privacy risks inherent in six LLM KD techniques. Using instruction-tuning settings that span seven NLP tasks, together with three teacher model families (GPT-2, LLAMA-2, and OPT), and various size student models, we demonstrate that all existing LLM KD approaches carry membership and memorization privacy risks from the teacher to its students. However, the extent of privacy risks varies across different KD techniques. We systematically analyse how key LLM KD components (KD objective functions, student training data and NLP tasks) impact such privacy risks. We also demonstrate a significant disagreement between memorization and membership privacy risks of LLM KD techniques. Finally, we characterize per-block privacy risk and demonstrate that the privacy risk varies across different blocks by a large margin.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel "unlearn-then-learn" strategy for precise knowledge editing in Large Language Models (LLMs). The strategy leverages the parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting and Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3). It involves a two-stage approach with an initial circuit localization phase to target specific internal components responsible for conflicting facts. Experimental results on microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct demonstrate near-perfect accuracy for new facts while effectively suppressing conflicting ones. The strategy shows unprecedented localization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches. Qualitative analysis reveals a mechanism of "soft forgetting" where original knowledge is suppressed from default retrieval but remains conditionally accessible, enhancing model safety. This advancement offers precise, localized, and safe knowledge management in compact LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with dynamic knowledge updates, especially when new information conflicts with deeply embedded facts. Such conflicting factual edits often lead to two critical issues: resistance to adopting the new fact and severe catastrophic forgetting of unrelated knowledge. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel "unlearn-then-learn" strategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting and Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach is powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets the specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact. Through a rigorous experimental methodology on microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically informed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the new, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original conflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits unprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating catastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed as low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted interpretability-guided intervention. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals a nuanced mechanism of "soft forgetting," where original knowledge is suppressed from default retrieval but remains latent and conditionally accessible, enhancing model safety and control. These findings represent a significant advancement towards precise, localized, and safe knowledge management in compact LLMs.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces a hybrid framework using Transformers and Autoencoders for detecting concept drift in applied machine learning. The proposed framework combines statistical and reconstruction-based drift metrics, prediction uncertainty, rules violations, and trend of classifier error to calculate a Trust Score for better drift detection. Using a time-sequenced airline passenger dataset with synthetic drift, the model showed early and sensitive detection compared to baseline methods. The Transformer-Autoencoder model outperformed traditional autoencoders in detecting drift, providing improved modeling with lower error rates and logical violations. Overall, the framework offers a robust solution for monitoring concept drift in real-time applications. <div>

Abstract: In applied machine learning, concept drift, which is either gradual or abrupt changes in data distribution, can significantly reduce model performance. Typical detection methods,such as statistical tests or reconstruction-based models,are generally reactive and not very sensitive to early detection. Our study proposes a hybrid framework consisting of Transformers and Autoencoders to model complex temporal dynamics and provide online drift detection. We create a distinct Trust Score methodology, which includes signals on (1) statistical and reconstruction-based drift metrics, more specifically, PSI, JSD, Transformer-AE error, (2) prediction uncertainty, (3) rules violations, and (4) trend of classifier error aligned with the combined metrics defined by the Trust Score. Using a time sequenced airline passenger data set with synthetic drift, our proposed model allows for a better detection of drift using as a whole and at different detection thresholds for both sensitivity and interpretability compared to baseline methods and provides a strong pipeline for drift detection in real time for applied machine learning. We evaluated performance using a time-sequenced airline passenger dataset having the gradually injected stimulus of drift in expectations,e.g. permuted ticket prices in later batches, broken into 10 time segments [1].In the data, our results support that the Transformation-Autoencoder detected drift earlier and with more sensitivity than the autoencoders commonly used in the literature, and provided improved modeling over more error rates and logical violations. Therefore, a robust framework was developed to reliably monitor concept drift.

<title>Towards High-Order Mean Flow Generative Models: Feasibility, Expressivity, and Provably Efficient Criteria</title>

Abstract: Generative modelling has seen significant advances through simulation-free paradigms such as Flow Matching, and in particular, the MeanFlow framework, which replaces instantaneous velocity fields with average velocities to enable efficient single-step sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretical study on Second-Order MeanFlow, a novel extension that incorporates average acceleration fields into the MeanFlow objective. We first establish the feasibility of our approach by proving that the average acceleration satisfies a generalized consistency condition analogous to first-order MeanFlow, thereby supporting stable, one-step sampling and tractable loss functions. We then characterize its expressivity via circuit complexity analysis, showing that under mild assumptions, the Second-Order MeanFlow sampling process can be implemented by uniform threshold circuits within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class. Finally, we derive provably efficient criteria for scalable implementation by leveraging fast approximate attention computations: we prove that attention operations within the Second-Order MeanFlow architecture can be approximated to within $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. Together, these results lay the theoretical foundation for high-order flow matching models that combine rich dynamics with practical sampling efficiency.

<title>BrainATCL: Adaptive Temporal Brain Connectivity Learning for Functional Link Prediction and Age Estimation</title>

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique widely used to study human brain activity. fMRI signals in areas across the brain transiently synchronise and desynchronise their activity in a highly structured manner, even when an individual is at rest. These functional connectivity dynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model these dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as they reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight into transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However, conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we propose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive temporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and age estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each snapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are subsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal representations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data of 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve spatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge attributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership of brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful topological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link prediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new machine learning (ML) methodology to obtain more precise predictions for some parameters of interest in a given hypotheses testing problem. Our proposed method also allows ML models to have more discriminative power in cases where it is extremely challenging for state-of-the-art classifiers to have any level of accurate predictions. This method can also allow us to systematically decrease the error from ML models in their predictions. In this paper, we provide a mathematical motivation why Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) would have more predictive power over their single-instance counterparts. We support our theoretical claims by analyzing the behavior of the MIL models through their scaling behaviors with respect to the number of instances on which the model makes predictions. As a concrete application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that under certain circumstances, it might be possible to extract the theoretical maximum Fisher Information latent in a dataset.

<title>From Nodes to Narratives: Explaining Graph Neural Networks with LLMs and Graph Context</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over structured data, including text-attributed graphs, which are common in domains such as citation networks, social platforms, and knowledge graphs. GNNs are not inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed. However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable, fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric metrics such as insightfulness. LOGIC sets a new direction for LLM-based explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human reasoning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph neural network-based performance prediction algorithm to address the challenge of forecasting performance fluctuations in distributed backend systems with multi-level service call structures. The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a sequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service nodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified spatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph convolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the service topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic evolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also introduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal sequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the multi-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future service performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of multi-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time windows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate the model's predictive performance and stability. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods across key metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. It maintains strong robustness under varying load intensities and structural complexities. These results demonstrate the model's practical potential for backend service performance management tasks.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction remains a tremendous challenge due to its multifactorial etiology and global burden of morbidity and mortality. Despite the growing availability of genomic and electrophysiological data, extracting biologically meaningful insights from such high-dimensional, noisy, and sparsely annotated datasets remains a non-trivial task. Recently, LLMs has been applied effectively to predict structural variations in biological sequences. In this work, we explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to predict cardiac diseases and SNPs potentially leading to CVD risk using genetic markers derived from high-throughput genomic profiling. We investigate the effect of genetic patterns associated with cardiac conditions and evaluate how LLMs can learn latent biological relationships from structured and semi-structured genomic data obtained by mapping genetic aspects that are inherited from the family tree. By framing the problem as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning task, the models are prompted to generate disease labels and articulate informed clinical deductions across diverse patient profiles and phenotypes. The findings highlight the promise of LLMs in contributing to early detection, risk assessment, and ultimately, the advancement of personalized medicine in cardiac care.

<title>A Globally Optimal Analytic Solution for Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Nonnegative or Mixed Inputs</title>

Abstract: Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (semi-NMF) extends classical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by allowing the basis matrix to contain both positive and negative entries, making it suitable for decomposing data with mixed signs. However, most existing semi-NMF algorithms are iterative, non-convex, and prone to local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel method that yields a globally optimal solution to the semi-NMF problem under the Frobenius norm, through an orthogonal decomposition derived from the scatter matrix of the input data. We rigorously prove that our solution attains the global minimum of the reconstruction error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the input matrix is nonnegative, our method often achieves lower reconstruction error than standard NMF algorithms, although unfortunately the basis matrix may not satisfy nonnegativity. In particular, in low-rank cases such as rank 1 or 2, our solution reduces exactly to a nonnegative factorization, recovering the NMF structure. We validate our approach through experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Wine dataset, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing NMF and semi-NMF methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy. These results confirm that our globally optimal, non-iterative formulation offers both theoretical guarantees and empirical advantages, providing a new perspective on matrix factorization in optimization and data analysis.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like Llama-3.1-8B.

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients jointly train a machine learning model by sharing gradient information, instead of raw data, with a server over multiple rounds. To address the possibility of information leakage in spite of sharing only the gradients, Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is often used. In LDP, clients add a selective amount of noise to the gradients before sending the same to the server. Although such noise addition protects the privacy of clients, it leads to a degradation in global model accuracy. In this paper, we model this privacy-accuracy trade-off as a game, where the sever incentivizes the clients to add a lower degree of noise for achieving higher accuracy, while the clients attempt to preserve their privacy at the cost of a potential loss in accuracy. A token based incentivization mechanism is introduced in which the quantum of tokens credited to a client in an FL round is a function of the degree of perturbation of its gradients. The client can later access a newly updated global model only after acquiring enough tokens, which are to be deducted from its balance. We identify the players, their actions and payoff, and perform a strategic analysis of the game. Extensive experiments were carried out to study the impact of different parameters.

Abstract: Low-precision training has become essential for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantization of gradients introduces both magnitude shrinkage and additive noise, which can alter the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this work, we study the convergence of SGD under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor $q_k \in (0,1]$ and perturbed by zero-mean quantization noise. We show that this shrinkage is equivalent to replacing the nominal stepsize $\mu_k$ with an effective stepsize $\mu_k q_k$, which slows convergence when $q_{\min} < 1$. Under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a reduced rate determined by $q_{\min}$, and with an increased asymptotic error floor due to quantization noise. We theoretically analyze how reduced numerical precision slows down training by modeling it as gradient shrinkage in the standard SGD convergence framework.

<title>What One Cannot, Two Can: Two-Layer Transformers Provably Represent Induction Heads on Any-Order Markov Chains</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a hallmark capability of transformers, through which trained models learn to adapt to new tasks by leveraging information from the input context. Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to the presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence between induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling sequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of model depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can efficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart cannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher order Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three layers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a two-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In this paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer transformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional k-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the interplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this, we further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction, focusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating how effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together, these results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and illustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL capabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks.

Abstract: Learning stochastic functions from partially observed context-target pairs is a fundamental problem in probabilistic modeling. Traditional models like Gaussian Processes (GPs) face scalability issues with large datasets and assume Gaussianity, limiting their applicability. While Neural Processes (NPs) offer more flexibility, they struggle with capturing complex, multi-modal target distributions. Neural Diffusion Processes (NDPs) enhance expressivity through a learned diffusion process but rely solely on conditional signals in the denoising network, resulting in weak input coupling from an unconditional forward process and semantic mismatch at the diffusion endpoint. In this work, we propose Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs), a novel method for modeling stochastic functions where inputs x act as dynamic anchors for the entire diffusion trajectory. By reformulating the forward kernel to explicitly depend on x, NBP enforces a constrained path that strictly terminates at the supervised target. This approach not only provides stronger gradient signals but also guarantees endpoint coherence. We validate NBPs on synthetic data, EEG signal regression and image regression tasks, achieving substantial improvements over baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of DDPM-style bridge sampling in enhancing both performance and theoretical consistency for structured prediction tasks.

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias. Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware causal inference.

EDGE unifies psychometrics (IRT/Bayesian state space models), cog-nitive diagnostics (misconception discovery from distractor patterns and response latencies), contrastive item generation (minimal perturbations that invalidate learner shortcuts while pre-serving psychometric validity), and principled scheduling (a restless bandit approximation to spaced retrieval). We formalize a composite readiness metric, EdgeScore, prove its monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity, and derive an index policy that is near-optimal under mild assumptions on forgetting and learning gains. We further establish conditions under which counterfactual items provably reduce the posterior probability of a targeted misconception faster than standard practice. The paper focuses on theory and implementable pseudocode; empirical study is left to future work.

<title>Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion Model for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting negative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to guide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process, CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.

Abstract: We consider the problem of risk-sensitive control in a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. In particular, we aim to find a risk-optimal policy by maximizing the distortion riskmetric (DRM) of the discounted reward in a finite horizon Markov decision process (MDP). DRMs are a rich class of risk measures that include several well-known risk measures as special cases. We derive a policy Hessian theorem for the DRM objective using the likelihood ratio method. Using this result, we propose a natural DRM Hessian estimator from sample trajectories of the underlying MDP. Next, we present a cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm for solving this problem in an on-policy RL setting using estimates of the DRM gradient and Hessian. Our proposed algorithm is shown to converge to an $\epsilon$-second-order stationary point ($\epsilon$-SOSP) of the DRM objective, and this guarantee ensures the escaping of saddle points. The sample complexity of our algorithms to find an $ \epsilon$-SOSP is $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$. Our experiments validate the theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, our is the first work to present convergence to an $\epsilon$-SOSP of a risk-sensitive objective, while existing works in the literature have either shown convergence to a first-order stationary point of a risk-sensitive objective, or a SOSP of a risk-neutral one.

Abstract: Reliable seizure detection is critical for diagnosing and managing epilepsy, yet clinical workflows remain dependent on time-consuming manual EEG interpretation. While machine learning has shown promise, existing approaches often rely on dataset-specific optimisations, limiting their real-world applicability and reproducibility. Here, we introduce an innovative, open-source machine-learning framework that enables robust and generalisable seizure detection across varied clinical datasets. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available EEG datasets that differ in patient populations and electrode configurations. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates an automated pre-processing pipeline to standardise data and a majority voting mechanism, in which multiple models independently assess each second of EEG before reaching a final decision. We train, tune, and evaluate models within each dataset, assessing their cross-dataset transferability. Our models achieve high within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904+/-0.059 for CHB-MIT and 0.864+/-0.060 for TUSZ) and demonstrate strong generalisation across datasets despite differences in EEG setups and populations (AUC 0.615+/-0.039 for models trained on CHB-MIT and tested on TUSZ and 0.762+/-0.175 in the reverse case) without any post-processing. Furthermore, a mild post-processing improved the within-dataset results to 0.913+/-0.064 and 0.867+/-0.058 and cross-dataset results to 0.619+/-0.036 and 0.768+/-0.172. These results underscore the potential of, and essential considerations for, deploying our framework in diverse clinical settings. By making our methodology fully reproducible, we provide a foundation for advancing clinically viable, dataset-agnostic seizure detection systems. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption, complementing rather than replacing expert interpretation, and accelerating clinical integration.

Abstract: The goal of data attribution is to trace the model's predictions through the learning algorithm and back to its training data. thereby identifying the most influential training samples and understanding how the model's behavior leads to particular predictions. Understanding how individual training examples influence a model's predictions is fundamental for machine learning interpretability, data debugging, and model accountability. Influence functions, originating from robust statistics, offer an efficient, first-order approximation to estimate the impact of marginally upweighting or removing a data point on a model's learned parameters and its subsequent predictions, without the need for expensive retraining. This paper comprehensively reviews the data attribution capability of influence functions in deep learning. We discuss their theoretical foundations, recent algorithmic advances for efficient inverse-Hessian-vector product estimation, and evaluate their effectiveness for data attribution and mislabel detection. Finally, highlighting current challenges and promising directions for unleashing the huge potential of influence functions in large-scale, real-world deep learning scenarios.

<title>When Is Prior Knowledge Helpful? Exploring the Evaluation and Selection of Unsupervised Pretext Tasks from a Neuro-Symbolic Perspective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (Nesy) learning improves the target task performance of models by enabling them to satisfy knowledge, while semi/self-supervised learning (SSL) improves the target task performance by designing unsupervised pretext tasks for unlabeled data to make models satisfy corresponding assumptions. We extend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of unreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical frameworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance hinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model, knowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with respect to the target. We further propose schemes to operationalize these theoretical metrics, and thereby develop a method that can predict the effectiveness of pretext tasks in advance. This will change the current status quo in practical applications, where the selections of unsupervised tasks are heuristic-based rather than theory-based, and it is difficult to evaluate the rationality of unsupervised pretext task selection before testing the model on the target task. In experiments, we verify a high correlation between the predicted performance-estimated using minimal data-and the actual performance achieved after large-scale semi-supervised or self-supervised learning, thus confirming the validity of the theory and the effectiveness of the evaluation method.

<title>Efficient Edge LLMs Deployment via HessianAware Quantization and CPU GPU Collaborative</title>

Abstract: With the breakthrough progress of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing and multimodal tasks, efficiently deploying them on resource-constrained edge devices has become a critical challenge. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse activation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The presence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe degradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights, significantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory, efficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to balance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ) and CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian matrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and weights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers while ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we design an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which, combined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment and scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory footprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series and Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of the low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while GPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is significantly improved.

Abstract: Stochastic interpolants offer a robust framework for continuously transforming samples between arbitrary data distributions, holding significant promise for generative modeling. Despite their potential, rigorous finite-time convergence guarantees for practical numerical schemes remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address the finite-time convergence analysis of numerical implementations for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived from stochastic interpolants. Specifically, we establish novel finite-time error bounds in total variation distance for two widely used numerical integrators: the first-order forward Euler method and the second-order Heun's method. Furthermore, our analysis on the iteration complexity of specific stochastic interpolant constructions provides optimized schedules to enhance computational efficiency. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by numerical experiments, which validate the derived error bounds and complexity analyses.

Abstract: \textbf{Introduction:} Accurate prediction of Phage Virion Proteins (PVP) is essential for genomic studies due to their crucial role as structural elements in bacteriophages. Computational tools, particularly machine learning, have emerged for annotating phage protein sequences from high-throughput sequencing. However, effective annotation requires specialized sequence encodings. Our paper introduces ProteoKnight, a new image-based encoding method that addresses spatial constraints in existing techniques, yielding competitive performance in PVP classification using pre-trained convolutional neural networks. Additionally, our study evaluates prediction uncertainty in binary PVP classification through Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD). \textbf{Methods:} ProteoKnight adapts the classical DNA-Walk algorithm for protein sequences, incorporating pixel colors and adjusting walk distances to capture intricate protein features. Encoded sequences were classified using multiple pre-trained CNNs. Variance and entropy measures assessed prediction uncertainty across proteins of various classes and lengths. \textbf{Results:} Our experiments achieved 90.8% accuracy in binary classification, comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Multi-class classification accuracy remains suboptimal. Our uncertainty analysis unveils variability in prediction confidence influenced by protein class and sequence length. \textbf{Conclusions:} Our study surpasses frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) by introducing novel image encoding that mitigates spatial information loss limitations. Our classification technique yields accurate and robust PVP predictions while identifying low-confidence predictions.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the theory of deep learning is to understand whether gradient-based training in high-dimensional parameter spaces can be captured by simpler, lower-dimensional structures, leading to so-called implicit bias. As a stepping stone, we study when a gradient flow on a high-dimensional variable $\theta$ implies an intrinsic gradient flow on a lower-dimensional variable $z = \phi(\theta)$, for an architecture-related function $\phi$. We express a so-called intrinsic dynamic property and show how it is related to the study of conservation laws associated with the factorization $\phi$. This leads to a simple criterion based on the inclusion of kernels of linear maps which yields a necessary condition for this property to hold. We then apply our theory to general ReLU networks of arbitrary depth and show that, for any initialization, it is possible to rewrite the flow as an intrinsic dynamic in a lower dimension that depends only on $z$ and the initialization, when $\phi$ is the so-called path-lifting. In the case of linear networks with $\phi$ the product of weight matrices, so-called balanced initializations are also known to enable such a dimensionality reduction; we generalize this result to a broader class of {\em relaxed balanced} initializations, showing that, in certain configurations, these are the \emph{only} initializations that ensure the intrinsic dynamic property. Finally, for the linear neural ODE associated with the limit of infinitely deep linear networks, with relaxed balanced initialization, we explicitly express the corresponding intrinsic dynamics.

Abstract: Modern methods of generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image translation based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control theory aim to transform an initial density to a target one in an optimal way. In the present paper, we assume that we only have access to i.i.d. samples from initial and final distributions. This makes our setup suitable for both generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image translation. Relying on the stochastic optimal control approach, we choose an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as the reference one and estimate the corresponding Schr\"odinger potential. Introducing a risk function as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between couplings, we derive tight bounds on generalization ability of an empirical risk minimizer in a class of Schr\"odinger potentials including Gaussian mixtures. Thanks to the mixing properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we almost achieve fast rates of convergence up to some logarithmic factors in favourable scenarios. We also illustrate performance of the suggested approach with numerical experiments.

<title>Parity Requires Unified Input Dependence and Negative Eigenvalues in SSMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that LRNN models such as S4D, Mamba, and DeltaNet lack state-tracking capability due to either time-invariant transition matrices or restricted eigenvalue ranges. To address this, input-dependent transition matrices, particularly those that are complex or non-triangular, have been proposed to enhance SSM performance on such tasks. While existing theorems demonstrate that both input-independent and non-negative SSMs are incapable of solving simple state-tracking tasks, such as parity, regardless of depth, they do not explore whether combining these two types in a multilayer SSM could help. We investigate this question for efficient SSMs with diagonal transition matrices and show that such combinations still fail to solve parity. This implies that a recurrence layer must both be input-dependent and include negative eigenvalues. Our experiments support this conclusion by analyzing an SSM model that combines S4D and Mamba layers.

<title>Efficient Reward Identification In Max Entropy Reinforcement Learning with Sparsity and Rank Priors</title>

arXiv:2508.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering time-varying reward functions from either optimal policies or demonstrations coming from a max entropy reinforcement learning problem. This problem is highly ill-posed without additional assumptions on the underlying rewards. However, in many applications, the rewards are indeed parsimonious, and some prior information is available. We consider two such priors on the rewards: 1) rewards are mostly constant and they change infrequently, 2) rewards can be represented by a linear combination of a small number of feature functions. We first show that the reward identification problem with the former prior can be recast as a sparsification problem subject to linear constraints. Moreover, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that solves this sparsification problem exactly. Then, we show that identifying rewards representable with the minimum number of features can be recast as a rank minimization problem subject to linear constraints, for which convex relaxations of rank can be invoked. In both cases, these observations lead to efficient optimization-based reward identification algorithms. Several examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the recovered rewards as well as their generalizability.

Abstract: Lightning, a common feature of severe meteorological conditions, poses significant risks, from direct human injuries to substantial economic losses. These risks are further exacerbated by climate change. Early and accurate prediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people, protect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present DeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning occurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they often struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty of lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar reflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly sensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight leverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud properties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder architecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically captures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel Hazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of lightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling the model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments show that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning prediction.

arXiv:2508.07440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing operator learning methods rely on supervised training with high-fidelity simulation data, introducing significant computational cost. In this work, we propose the deep Onsager operator learning (DOOL) method, a novel unsupervised framework for solving dissipative equations. Rooted in the Onsager variational principle (OVP), DOOL trains a deep operator network by directly minimizing the OVP-defined Rayleighian functional, requiring no labeled data, and then proceeds in time explicitly through conservation/change laws for the solution. Another key innovation here lies in the spatiotemporal decoupling strategy: the operator's trunk network processes spatial coordinates exclusively, thereby enhancing training efficiency, while integrated external time stepping enables temporal extrapolation. Numerical experiments on typical dissipative equations validate the effectiveness of the DOOL method, and systematic comparisons with supervised DeepONet and MIONet demonstrate its enhanced performance. Extensions are made to cover the second-order wave models with dissipation that do not directly follow OVP.

Abstract: Integrated, end-to-end learning of representations and policies remains a cornerstone of deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, to address the challenge of learning effective features from a sparse reward signal, recent trends have shifted towards adding complex auxiliary objectives or fully decoupling the two processes, often at the cost of increased design complexity. This work proposes an alternative to both decoupling and naive end-to-end learning, arguing that performance can be significantly improved by structuring the interaction between distinct perception and control networks with a principled, game-theoretic dynamic. We formalize this dynamic by introducing the Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER) framework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a Stackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features to benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize its Bellman error. We approximate the game's equilibrium with a practical two-timescale algorithm. Applied to standard DQN variants on benchmark tasks, SCORER improves sample efficiency and final performance. Our results show that performance gains can be achieved through principled algorithmic design of the perception-control dynamic, without requiring complex auxiliary objectives or architectures.

<title>Towards Unveiling Predictive Uncertainty Vulnerabilities in the Context of the Right to Be Forgotten</title>

arXiv:2508.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, various uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to provide certainty and probability estimates for deep learning models' label predictions. Meanwhile, with the growing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning has been extensively studied as a means to remove the impact of requested sensitive data from a pre-trained model without retraining the model from scratch. However, the vulnerabilities of such generated predictive uncertainties with regard to dedicated malicious unlearning attacks remain unexplored. To bridge this gap, for the first time, we propose a new class of malicious unlearning attacks against predictive uncertainties, where the adversary aims to cause the desired manipulations of specific predictive uncertainty results. We also design novel optimization frameworks for our attacks and conduct extensive experiments, including black-box scenarios. Notably, our extensive experiments show that our attacks are more effective in manipulating predictive uncertainties than traditional attacks that focus on label misclassifications, and existing defenses against conventional attacks are ineffective against our attacks.

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality and complex interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance (e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.

arXiv:2508.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Online Convex Optimization (OCO), when the stochastic gradient has a finite variance, many algorithms provably work and guarantee a sublinear regret. However, limited results are known if the gradient estimate has a heavy tail, i.e., the stochastic gradient only admits a finite $\mathsf{p}$-th central moment for some $\mathsf{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$. Motivated by it, this work examines different old algorithms for OCO (e.g., Online Gradient Descent) in the more challenging heavy-tailed setting. Under the standard bounded domain assumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any algorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in all parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\mathsf{p}$), suggesting that OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation (e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A particularly interesting one is the first provable convergence result for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient clipping. Furthermore, we explore broader settings (e.g., smooth OCO) and extend our ideas to optimistic algorithms to handle different cases simultaneously.

<title>N-BEATS-MOE: N-BEATS with a Mixture-of-Experts Layer for Heterogeneous Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Deep learning approaches are increasingly relevant for time series forecasting tasks. Methods such as N-BEATS, which is built on stacks of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) blocks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and competitions. N-BEATS is also more interpretable relative to other deep learning approaches, as it decomposes forecasts into different time series components, such as trend and seasonality. In this work, we present N-BEATS-MOE, an extension of N-BEATS based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer. N-BEATS-MOE employs a dynamic block weighting strategy based on a gating network which allows the model to better adapt to the characteristics of each time series. We also hypothesize that the gating mechanism provides additional interpretability by identifying which expert is most relevant for each series. We evaluate our method across 12 benchmark datasets against several approaches, achieving consistent improvements on several datasets, especially those composed of heterogeneous time series.

<title>Enhancing Privacy in Decentralized Min-Max Optimization: A Differentially Private Approach</title>

Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm, one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>FairDRL-ST: Disentangled Representation Learning for Fair Spatio-Temporal Mobility Prediction</title>

Abstract: As deep spatio-temporal neural networks are increasingly utilised in urban computing contexts, the deployment of such methods can have a direct impact on users of critical urban infrastructure, such as public transport, emergency services, and traffic management systems. While many spatio-temporal methods focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups, thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.

<title>Physics-Informed Multimodal Bearing Fault Classification under Variable Operating Conditions using Transfer Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07536</link>

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable bearing fault classification is critical for ensuring the reliability of rotating machinery, particularly under variable operating conditions where domain shifts can significantly degrade model performance. This study proposes a physics-informed multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN) with a late fusion architecture, integrating vibration and motor current signals alongside a dedicated physics-based feature extraction branch. The model incorporates a novel physics-informed loss function that penalizes physically implausible predictions based on characteristic bearing fault frequencies - Ball Pass Frequency Outer (BPFO) and Ball Pass Frequency Inner (BPFI) - derived from bearing geometry and shaft speed. Comprehensive experiments on the Paderborn University dataset demonstrate that the proposed physics-informed approach consistently outperforms a non-physics-informed baseline, achieving higher accuracy, reduced false classifications, and improved robustness across multiple data splits. To address performance degradation under unseen operating conditions, three transfer learning (TL) strategies - Target-Specific Fine-Tuning (TSFT), Layer-Wise Adaptation Strategy (LAS), and Hybrid Feature Reuse (HFR) - are evaluated. Results show that LAS yields the best generalization, with additional performance gains when combined with physics-informed modeling. Validation on the KAIST bearing dataset confirms the framework's cross-dataset applicability, achieving up to 98 percent accuracy. Statistical hypothesis testing further verifies significant improvements (p < 0.01) in classification performance. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven learning to achieve robust, interpretable, and generalizable fault diagnosis for real-world industrial applications.

Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using features collected from remote sensors. As sensor observations may change dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks. However, timely delivering features from all modalities is often infeasible due to limited network resources. To this end, we study a two-modality scheduling problem to minimize the ML model's inference error, which is expressed as a penalty function of AoI for both modalities. We develop an index-based threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches modalities when the current modality's index function exceeds a threshold. We show that the two modalities share the same threshold, and both the index functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. The optimality of our policy holds for (i) general AoI functions that are \emph{non-monotonic} and \emph{non-additive} and (ii) \emph{heterogeneous} transmission times. Numerical results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared to round-robin and uniform random policies, which are oblivious to the AoI-based inference error function. Our results shed light on how to improve remote inference accuracy by optimizing task-oriented AoI functions.

<title>Uncertainty-Driven Reliability: Selective Prediction and Trustworthy Deployment in Modern Machine Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07556</link>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where reliability is paramount. This thesis investigates how uncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML, focusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is low.
  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty signals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By ensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight, post-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep ensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance. Crucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP), allowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find that while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains robust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty trade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective classification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve -- identifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions can close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking errors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show that uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or deny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining calibration audits with verifiable inference.
  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating, and safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make accurate predictions -- but also know when to say "I do not know".

Abstract: Using more test-time computation during language model inference, such as generating more intermediate thoughts or sampling multiple candidate answers, has proven effective in significantly improving model performance. This paper takes an initial step toward bridging the gap between practical language model inference and theoretical transformer analysis by incorporating randomness and sampling. We focus on in-context linear regression with continuous/binary coefficients, where our framework simulates language model decoding through noise injection and binary coefficient sampling. Through this framework, we provide detailed analyses of widely adopted inference techniques. Supported by empirical results, our theoretical framework and analysis demonstrate the potential for offering new insights into understanding inference behaviors in real-world language models.

<title>When and how can inexact generative models still sample from the data manifold?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the following: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector field, the generated samples appear to shift \emph{along} the support of the data distribution but not \emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon of \emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical systems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our perturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal learning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target density only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models. Further, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the support? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive infinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the boundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient condition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment. Moreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for robust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the tangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation analysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements and extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative models from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty quantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical generative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative models, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the manifold hypothesis.

<title>Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5\% on AIME 2024, 83.2\% on AIME 2025, 66.0\% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1\% on LiveCodeBench V6.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior $p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case) under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior sampling in polynomial time.

<title>Attribution Explanations for Deep Neural Networks: A Theoretical Perspective</title>

Abstract: Attribution explanation is a typical approach for explaining deep neural networks (DNNs), inferring an importance or contribution score for each input variable to the final output. In recent years, numerous attribution methods have been developed to explain DNNs. However, a persistent concern remains unresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the actual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The faithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of attribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core challenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to their unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and implementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack solid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent, ambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is challenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a promising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We summarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i) Theoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among methods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale, clarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation, rigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles. Beyond a comprehensive review, we provide insights into how these studies help deepen theoretical understanding, inform method selection, and inspire new attribution methods. We conclude with a discussion of promising open problems for further work.

Abstract: Implicit continuous models, such as functional models and implicit neural networks, are an increasingly popular method for replacing discrete data representations with continuous, high-order, and differentiable surrogates. These models offer new perspectives on the storage, transfer, and analysis of scientific data. In this paper, we introduce the first framework to directly extract complex topological features -- contours, Jacobi sets, and ridge-valley graphs -- from a type of continuous implicit model known as multivariate functional approximation (MFA). MFA replaces discrete data with continuous piecewise smooth functions. Given an MFA model as the input, our approach enables direct extraction of complex topological features from the model, without reverting to a discrete representation of the model. Our work is easily generalizable to any continuous implicit model that supports the queries of function values and high-order derivatives. Our work establishes the building blocks for performing topological data analysis and visualization on implicit continuous models.

<title>Beyond Single: A Data Selection Principle for LLM Alignment via Fine-Grained Preference Signals</title>

arXiv:2508.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human values requires moving beyond a single holistic "better-than" preference criterion. While collecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and scalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In this paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first derive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a key Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference conflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it to formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our principle advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by the most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality of this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the selection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical methods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our PD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying conflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10% relative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a stronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting training efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference annotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained preference signals.

Abstract: While defenses against single-turn jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved significantly, multi-turn jailbreaks remain a persistent vulnerability, often achieving success rates exceeding 70% against models optimized for single-turn protection. This work presents an empirical analysis of automated multi-turn jailbreak attacks across state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini variants, using the StrongREJECT benchmark. Our findings challenge the perceived sophistication of multi-turn attacks: when accounting for the attacker's ability to learn from how models refuse harmful requests, multi-turn jailbreaking approaches are approximately equivalent to simply resampling single-turn attacks multiple times. Moreover, attack success is correlated among similar models, making it easier to jailbreak newly released ones. Additionally, for reasoning models, we find surprisingly that higher reasoning effort often leads to higher attack success rates. Our results have important implications for AI safety evaluation and the design of jailbreak-resistant systems. We release the source code at https://github.com/diogo-cruz/multi_turn_simpler

<title>Discovering Spatial Correlations between Earth Observations in Global Atmospheric State Estimation by using Adaptive Graph Structure Learning</title>

Abstract: This study aims to discover spatial correlations between Earth observations and atmospheric states to improve the forecasting accuracy of global atmospheric state estimation, which are usually conducted using conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems and is the beginning of weather forecasting. NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations, which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However, structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing STGNN models with and without structure learning.

Abstract: Classification is one of the most widespread tasks in AI applications, serving often as the first step in filtering, sorting, and categorizing data. Since modern AI systems must handle large volumes of input data and early pipeline stages can propagate errors downstream, achieving high efficiency and accuracy is critical. Moreover, classification requirements can change dynamically based on user needs, necessitating models with strong zero-shot capabilities. While generative LLMs have become mainstream for zero-shot classification due to their versatility, they suffer from inconsistent instruction following and computational inefficiency. Cross-encoders, commonly used as rerankers in RAG pipelines, face a different bottleneck: they must process text-label pairs sequentially, significantly reducing efficiency with large label sets. Embedding-based approaches offer good efficiency but struggle with complex scenarios involving logical and semantic constraints. We propose GLiClass, a novel method that adapts the GLiNER architecture for sequence classification tasks. Our approach achieves strong accuracy and efficiency comparable to embedding-based methods, while maintaining the flexibility needed for zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we adapted proximal policy optimization (PPO) for multi-label text classification, enabling training classifiers in data-sparse conditions or from human feedback.

Abstract: With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However, existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent and efficient maritime traffic management.

<title>Semantic Caching for Low-Cost LLM Serving: From Offline Learning to Online Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.

<title>Multi-Hop Privacy Propagation for Differentially Private Federated Learning in Social Networks</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and facilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks. However, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's privacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on the privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop interactions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL mechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a multi-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes incentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their privacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling the magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked privacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the average external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and convergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being designed from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves approximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA) analysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while maintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA) baselines and methods that account for social externalities.

Abstract: Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection, causes organ dysfunction, making early detection and optimal management critical. Previous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient conditions.

<title>Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: The increasing demand for computational resources of training neural networks leads to a concerning growth in energy consumption. While parallelization has enabled upscaling model and dataset sizes and accelerated training, its impact on energy consumption is often overlooked. To close this research gap, we conducted scaling experiments for data-parallel training of two models, ResNet50 and FourCastNet, and evaluated the impact of parallelization parameters, i.e., GPU count, global batch size, and local batch size, on predictive performance, training time, and energy consumption. We show that energy consumption scales approximately linearly with the consumed resources, i.e., GPU hours; however, the respective scaling factor differs substantially between distinct model trainings and hardware, and is systematically influenced by the number of samples and gradient updates per GPU hour. Our results shed light on the complex interplay of scaling up neural network training and can inform future developments towards more sustainable AI research.

Abstract: Leveraging the event-driven paradigm, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising approach for constructing energy-efficient Transformer architectures. Compared to directly trained Spiking Transformers, ANN-to-SNN conversion methods bypass the high training costs. However, existing methods still suffer from notable limitations, failing to effectively handle nonlinear operations in Transformer architectures and requiring additional fine-tuning processes for pre-trained ANNs. To address these issues, we propose a high-performance and training-free ANN-to-SNN conversion framework tailored for Transformer architectures. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-basis Exponential Decay (MBE) neuron, which employs an exponential decay strategy and multi-basis encoding method to efficiently approximate various nonlinear operations. It removes the requirement for weight modifications in pre-trained ANNs. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (CV, NLU, NLG) and mainstream Transformer architectures (ViT, RoBERTa, GPT-2) demonstrate that our method achieves near-lossless conversion accuracy with significantly lower latency. This provides a promising pathway for the efficient and scalable deployment of Spiking Transformers in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks can memorize corrupted labels, making data quality critical for model performance, yet real-world datasets are frequently compromised by both label noise and input noise. This paper proposes a mutual information-based framework for data selection under hybrid noise scenarios that quantifies statistical dependencies between inputs and labels. We compute each sample's pointwise contribution to the overall mutual information and find that lower contributions indicate noisy or mislabeled instances. Empirical validation on MNIST with different synthetic noise settings demonstrates that the method effectively filters low-quality samples. Under label corruption, training on high-MI samples improves classification accuracy by up to 15\% compared to random sampling. Furthermore, the method exhibits robustness to benign input modifications, preserving semantically valid data while filtering truly corrupted samples.

<title>Robust Reinforcement Learning over Wireless Networks with Homomorphic State Representations</title>

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different communication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and capacity limitations.

<title>Separation and Collaboration: Two-Level Routing Grouped Mixture-of-Experts for Multi-Domain Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Multi-Domain Continual Learning (MDCL) acquires knowledge from sequential tasks with shifting class sets and distribution. Despite the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods can adapt for this dual heterogeneity, they still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and forward forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped Mixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method. Firstly, TRGE dynamically expands the pre-trained CLIP model, assigning specific expert group for each task to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. With the number of experts continually grows in this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and introduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by the increasing routing complexity. Meanwhile, we design an inter-group routing policy based on task identifiers and task prototype distance, which dynamically selects relevant expert groups and combines their outputs to enhance inter-task collaboration. Secondly, to get the correct task identifiers, we leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which own powerful multimodal comprehension capabilities to generate semantic task descriptions and recognize the correct task identifier. Finally, to mitigate forward forgetting, we dynamically fuse outputs for unseen samples from the frozen CLIP model and TRGE adapter based on training progress, leveraging both pre-trained and learned knowledge. Through extensive experiments across various settings, our method outperforms other advanced methods with fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize the return given a fixed dataset of agent trajectories without additional interactions with the environment. While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for offline RL algorithms.
  We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs, but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.

<title>Learning to Align, Aligning to Learn: A Unified Approach for Self-Optimized Alignment</title>

Abstract: Alignment methodologies have emerged as a critical pathway for enhancing language model alignment capabilities. While SFT (supervised fine-tuning) accelerates convergence through direct token-level loss intervention, its efficacy is constrained by offline policy trajectory. In contrast, RL(reinforcement learning) facilitates exploratory policy optimization, but suffers from low sample efficiency and stringent dependency on high-quality base models. To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative Alignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective strengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample generation strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward feedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging intra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates guided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes GRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over conventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human alignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving 57.70\%,17.65\% 7.95\% and 5.18\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and GRPO baselines respectively. This work provides both a theoretically grounded alignment framework and empirical evidence for efficient capability evolution in language models.

Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) for graphs achieve impressively high expressive power thanks to very efficient and scalable neural networks. However, these networks contain non-linearities that prevent analytical computation of many standard probabilistic inference queries, i.e., these DGMs are considered \emph{intractable}. While recently proposed Probabilistic Graph Circuits (PGCs) address this issue by enabling \emph{tractable} probabilistic inference, they operate on dense graph representations with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity for graphs with $n$ nodes and \emph{$m$ edges}. To address this scalability issue, we introduce Sparse PGCs, a new class of tractable generative models that operate directly on sparse graph representation, reducing the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n + m)$, which is particularly beneficial for $m \ll n^2$. In the context of de novo drug design, we empirically demonstrate that SPGCs retain exact inference capabilities, improve memory efficiency and inference speed, and match the performance of intractable DGMs in key metrics.

<title>Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment for Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting, objectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus creativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF, optimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that fails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This limitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making multi-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge this gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and computationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In contrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a closed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO approaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the number of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering direct optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is the number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within milliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto stationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least one other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning with its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to the MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a practical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse human values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI deployments.

However, extracting general chemical insight while balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that combines compressed higher-order topological signals with standard molecular features. Our approach captures global geometric information while preserving computational tractability and human-interpretable structure. We evaluate our model across a range of benchmarks, from small-molecule datasets to complex material datasets, and demonstrate superior performance using a parameter-efficient architecture. We achieve the best performing results in both accuracy and robustness across almost all benchmarks. We open source all code \footnote{All code and results can be found on Github https://github.com/rahulkhorana/TFC-PACT-Net}.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.
  We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then gradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek, and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release the source code to support future research.

Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks, relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete, difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data. However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased robustness-to-noise.

Abstract: Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena, they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences, a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for "in silico prototyping of experimental studies", e.g., to advance automated cognitive science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an accurate model of cognition.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. However, this study confirms the existence of overfitting in diffusion model training, particularly in data-limited regimes. To address this challenge, we propose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework specifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation approaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to noisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion. Crucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation of the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning objective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising spaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also theoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under general transformations. In experiments, we extensively validate ScoreAug on multiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, and ImageNet, with results demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines. Notably, ScoreAug effectively mitigates overfitting across diverse scenarios, such as varying data scales and model capacities, while exhibiting stable convergence properties. Another advantage of ScoreAug over standard data augmentation lies in its ability to circumvent data leakage issues under certain conditions. Furthermore, we show that ScoreAug can be synergistically combined with traditional data augmentation techniques to achieve additional performance gains.

Abstract: Time series forecasting poses significant challenges in non-stationary environments where underlying patterns evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances deep neural network (DNN) performance by leveraging specialized model adaptation and selection. Initially, a base DNN is trained offline on historical time series data. A reserved validation subset is then segmented to extract and cluster the most dominant patterns within the series, thereby identifying distinct regimes. For each identified cluster, the base DNN is fine-tuned to produce a specialized version that captures unique pattern characteristics. At inference, the most recent input is matched against the cluster centroids, and the corresponding fine-tuned version is deployed based on the closest similarity measure. Additionally, our approach integrates a concept drift detection mechanism to identify and adapt to emerging patterns caused by non-stationary behavior. The proposed framework is generalizable across various DNN architectures and has demonstrated significant performance gains on both traditional DNNs and recent advanced architectures implemented in the GluonTS library.

arXiv:2508.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms often assume all features contribute equally to the data structure, an assumption that usually fails in high-dimensional or noisy settings. Feature weighting methods can address this, but most require additional parameter tuning. We propose SHARK (Shapley Reweighted $k$-means), a feature-weighted clustering algorithm motivated by the use of Shapley values from cooperative game theory to quantify feature relevance, which requires no additional parameters beyond those in $k$-means. We prove that the $k$-means objective can be decomposed into a sum of per-feature Shapley values, providing an axiomatic foundation for unsupervised feature relevance and reducing Shapley computation from exponential to polynomial time. SHARK iteratively re-weights features by the inverse of their Shapley contribution, emphasising informative dimensions and down-weighting irrelevant ones. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that SHARK consistently matches or outperforms existing methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy, particularly in scenarios where noise may be present.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant challenges remain in scaling to complex multimodal workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows, effectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across a range of experimental scenarios, demonstrating that it achieves substantial improvements in throughput compared to state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been successfully deployed to train models supporting WeChat product features for a large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications.

<title>A Physics-informed Deep Operator for Real-Time Freeway Traffic State Estimation</title>

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories: model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision estimation results of flow and mean speed.

<title>Learning to Select MCP Algorithms: From Traditional ML to Dual-Channel GAT-MLP</title>

Abstract: Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.

<title>Communication-Efficient Zero-Order and First-Order Federated Learning Methods over Wireless Networks</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging learning framework that enables edge devices to collaboratively train ML models without sharing their local data. FL faces, however, a significant challenge due to the high amount of information that must be exchanged between the devices and the aggregator in the training phase, which can exceed the limited capacity of wireless systems. In this paper, two communication-efficient FL methods are considered where communication overhead is reduced by communicating scalar values instead of long vectors and by allowing high number of users to send information simultaneously. The first approach employs a zero-order optimization technique with two-point gradient estimator, while the second involves a first-order gradient computation strategy. The novelty lies in leveraging channel information in the learning algorithms, eliminating hence the need for additional resources to acquire channel state information (CSI) and to remove its impact, as well as in considering asynchronous devices. We provide a rigorous analytical framework for the two methods, deriving convergence guarantees and establishing appropriate performance bounds.

Abstract: Accurate power consumption prediction is crucial for improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact, yet traditional methods relying on specialized instruments or rigid physical models are impractical for large-scale, real-world deployment. This study introduces a scalable data-driven method using powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and deep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption in internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and cumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models performed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%, respectively. Results confirm the approach's effectiveness across vehicles and models. Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV datasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for robust models for advanced powertrains.

<title>BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning in Multimodal Models</title>

Abstract: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

Abstract: The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN) capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity (CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension, the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.

<title>From Source to Target: Leveraging Transfer Learning for Predictive Process Monitoring in Organizations</title>

Abstract: Event logs reflect the behavior of business processes that are mapped in organizational information systems. Predictive process monitoring (PPM) transforms these data into value by creating process-related predictions that provide the insights required for proactive interventions at process runtime. Existing PPM techniques require sufficient amounts of event data or other relevant resources that might not be readily available, preventing some organizations from utilizing PPM. The transfer learning-based PPM technique presented in this paper allows organizations without suitable event data or other relevant resources to implement PPM for effective decision support. The technique is instantiated in two real-life use cases, based on which numerical experiments are performed using event logs for IT service management processes in an intra- and inter-organizational setting. The results of the experiments suggest that knowledge of one business process can be transferred to a similar business process in the same or a different organization to enable effective PPM in the target context. With the proposed technique, organizations can benefit from transfer learning in an intra- and inter-organizational setting, where resources like pre-trained models are transferred within and across organizational boundaries.

Abstract: Connecting an ever-expanding catalogue of products with suitable manufacturers and suppliers is critical for resilient, efficient global supply chains, yet traditional methods struggle to capture complex capabilities, certifications, geographic constraints, and rich multimodal data of real-world manufacturer profiles. To address these gaps, we introduce PMGraph, a public benchmark of bipartite and heterogeneous multimodal supply-chain graphs linking 8,888 manufacturers, over 70k products, more than 110k manufacturer-product edges, and over 29k product images. Building on this benchmark, we propose the Cascade Multimodal Attributed Graph C-MAG, a two-stage architecture that first aligns and aggregates textual and visual attributes into intermediate group embeddings, then propagates them through a manufacturer-product hetero-graph via multiscale message passing to enhance link prediction accuracy. C-MAG also provides practical guidelines for modality-aware fusion, preserving predictive performance in noisy, real-world settings.

<title>ELF: Efficient Logic Synthesis by Pruning Redundancy in Refactoring</title>

arXiv:2508.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In electronic design automation, logic optimization operators play a crucial role in minimizing the gate count of logic circuits. However, their computation demands are high. Operators such as refactor conventionally form iterative cuts for each node, striving for a more compact representation - a task which often fails 98% on average. Prior research has sought to mitigate computational cost through parallelization. In contrast, our approach leverages a classifier to prune unsuccessful cuts preemptively, thus eliminating unnecessary resynthesis operations. Experiments on the refactor operator using the EPFL benchmark suite and 10 large industrial designs demonstrate that this technique can speedup logic optimization by 3.9x on average compared with the state-of-the-art ABC implementation.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a well-established framework for generating interpretable or white-box predictive models. Although SR has been successfully applied to create interpretable estimates of the average of the outcome, it is currently not well understood how it can be used to estimate the relationship between variables at other points in the distribution of the target variable. Such estimates of e.g. the median or an extreme value provide a fuller picture of how predictive variables affect the outcome and are necessary in high-stakes, safety-critical application domains. This study introduces Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR), an approach to predict conditional quantiles with SR. In an extensive evaluation, we find that SQR outperforms transparent models and performs comparably to a strong black-box baseline without compromising transparency. We also show how SQR can be used to explain differences in the target distribution by comparing models that predict extreme and central outcomes in an airline fuel usage case study. We conclude that SQR is suitable for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding interesting feature influences at varying quantiles.

Abstract: Reliable digital twins of lithium-ion batteries must achieve high physical fidelity with sub-millisecond speed. In this work, we benchmark three operator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed parameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each spectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are trained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant, triangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of State-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates constant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO maintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with voltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing parameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to varying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster than a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse tasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation, recovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute percentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in comparison with classical methods. These results pave the way for neural operators to meet the accuracy, speed and parametric flexibility demands of real-time battery management, design-of-experiments and large-scale inference. PE-FNO outperforms conventional neural surrogates, offering a practical path towards high-speed and high-fidelity electrochemical digital twins.

Abstract: Reliable indoor navigation remains a significant challenge in complex environments, particularly where external positioning signals and dedicated infrastructures are unavailable. This research presents Grid2Guide, a hybrid navigation framework that combines the A* search algorithm with a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate clear, human-readable route instructions. The framework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map. Using this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin and destination, producing concise textual navigation steps. These steps are then transformed into natural language instructions by the SLM, enhancing interpretability for end users. Experimental evaluations across various indoor scenarios demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing accurate and timely navigation guidance. The results validate the proposed approach as a lightweight, infrastructure-free solution for real-time indoor navigation support.

Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments. This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions. Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is committed to capturing students' knowledge mastery from their historical interactions. Simulating students' memory states is a promising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of knowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests during the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single, undifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as well as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes memoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational autoencoder. The model simulates memory dynamics through a three-stage process: (i) Learning the distribution of students' knowledge memory features, (ii) Reconstructing their exercise feedback, while (iii) Embedding a personalized forgetting module within the temporal workflow to dynamically modulate memory storage strength. This jointly models the complete encoding-storage-retrieval cycle, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for individual differences. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large-scale models pre-trained on Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown promise in clinical applications such as neurological disorder detection. However, the practical deployment of EEG-based large-scale models faces critical challenges such as limited labeled EEG data and suboptimal performance in clinical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDx-LM, a novel large-scale model specifically designed for detecting EEG-based neurological disorders. Our key contributions include (i) a Selective Temporal-Frequency Embedding mechanism that adaptively captures complex temporal and spectral patterns in EEG signals; and (ii) a Progressive Feature-Aware Training strategy that refines feature representation in a two-stage process. In the first stage, our model learns the fundamental discriminative features of EEG activities; in the second stage, the model further extracts more specialized fine-grained features for accurate diagnostic performance. We evaluated NeuroDx-LM on the CHB-MIT and Schizophrenia datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in EEG-based seizure and schizophrenia detection, respectively. These results demonstrate the great potential of EEG-based large-scale models to advance clinical applicability. Our code is available at https://github.com/LetItBe12345/NeuroDx-LM.

Abstract: In the active learning paradigm, using an oracle to label data has always been a complex and expensive task, and with the emersion of large unlabeled data pools, it would be highly beneficial If we could achieve better results without relying on an oracle. This research introduces OFAL, an oracle-free active learning scheme that utilizes neural network uncertainty. OFAL uses the model's own uncertainty to transform highly confident unlabeled samples into informative uncertain samples. First, we start with separating and quantifying different parts of uncertainty and introduce Monte Carlo Dropouts as an approximation of the Bayesian Neural Network model. Secondly, by adding a variational autoencoder, we go on to generate new uncertain samples by stepping toward the uncertain part of latent space starting from a confidence seed sample. By generating these new informative samples, we can perform active learning and enhance the model's accuracy. Lastly, we try to compare and integrate our method with other widely used active learning sampling methods.

Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research, inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason + Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant, capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools, automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates. Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation, overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8% accuracy on Reas-100.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being utilized in various aspects of our daily lives, including high-stakes decision-making applications that impact individuals. However, these systems reflect and amplify bias from the data used during training and testing, potentially resulting in biased behavior and inaccurate decisions. For instance, having different misclassification rates between white and black sub-populations. However, effectively and efficiently identifying and correcting biased behavior in DNNs is a challenge. This paper introduces FairFLRep, an automated fairness-aware fault localization and repair technique that identifies and corrects potentially bias-inducing neurons in DNN classifiers. FairFLRep focuses on adjusting neuron weights associated with sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, that contribute to unfair decisions. By analyzing the input-output relationships within the network, FairFLRep corrects neurons responsible for disparities in predictive quality parity. We evaluate FairFLRep on four image classification datasets using two DNN classifiers, and four tabular datasets with a DNN model. The results show that FairFLRep consistently outperforms existing methods in improving fairness while preserving accuracy. An ablation study confirms the importance of considering fairness during both fault localization and repair stages. Our findings also show that FairFLRep is more efficient than the baseline approaches in repairing the network.

Abstract: Developing accurate and generalizable epileptic seizure prediction models from electroencephalography (EEG) data across multiple clinical sites is hindered by patient privacy regulations and significant data heterogeneity (non-IID characteristics). Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving framework for collaborative training, but standard aggregation methods like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) can be biased by dominant datasets in heterogeneous settings. This paper investigates FL for seizure prediction using a single EEG channel across four diverse public datasets (Siena, CHB-MIT, Helsinki, NCH), representing distinct patient populations (adult, pediatric, neonate) and recording conditions. We implement privacy-preserving global normalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each client trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring equal contribution during aggregation. Our results show that locally trained models fail to generalize across sites, and standard weighted FedAvg yields highly skewed performance (e.g., 89.0% accuracy on CHB-MIT but only 50.8% on Helsinki and 50.6% on NCH). In contrast, Random Subset Aggregation significantly improves performance on under-represented clients (accuracy increases to 81.7% on Helsinki and 68.7% on NCH) and achieves a superior macro-average accuracy of 77.1% and pooled accuracy of 80.0% across all sites, demonstrating a more robust and fair global model. This work highlights the potential of balanced FL approaches for building effective and generalizable seizure prediction systems in realistic, heterogeneous multi-hospital environments while respecting data privacy.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance, but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use. We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules in tabular classification, notably on an example from the medical field where interpretability has tangible value.

Abstract: Personalised music-based interventions offer a powerful means of supporting motor rehabilitation by dynamically tailoring auditory stimuli to provide external timekeeping cues, modulate affective states, and stabilise gait patterns. Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for adapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject variability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts and motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and results in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space Alignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to enhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and sequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the geometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation. Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant performance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion approach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with robust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode configurations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

<title>Multi-head Transformers Provably Learn Symbolic Multi-step Reasoning via Gradient Descent</title>

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks: a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise require deeper architectures.

<title>AuthPrint: Fingerprinting Generative Models Against Malicious Model Providers</title>

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains, yet current deployments offer no mechanisms to verify the origin of model outputs. We address this gap by extending model fingerprinting techniques beyond the traditional collaborative setting to one where the model provider may act adversarially. To our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate fingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. The methods rely on a trusted verifier that extracts secret fingerprints from the model's output space, unknown to the provider, and trains a model to predict and verify them. Our empirical evaluation shows that our methods achieve near-zero FPR@95%TPR for instances of GAN and diffusion models, even when tested on small modifications to the original architecture and training data. Moreover, the methods remain robust against adversarial attacks that actively modify the outputs to bypass detection. Source codes are available at https://github.com/PSMLab/authprint.

<title>Forecasting Commodity Price Shocks Using Temporal and Semantic Fusion of Prices Signals and Agentic Generative AI Extracted Economic News</title>

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of commodity price spikes is vital for countries with limited economic buffers, where sudden increases can strain national budgets, disrupt import-reliant sectors, and undermine food and energy security. This paper introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that combines historical commodity price data with semantic signals derived from global economic news, using an agentic generative AI pipeline. The architecture integrates dual-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to fuse structured time-series inputs with semantically embedded, fact-checked news summaries collected from 1960 to 2023. The model is evaluated on a 64-year dataset comprising normalized commodity price series and temporally aligned news embeddings. Results show that the proposed approach achieves a mean AUC of 0.94 and an overall accuracy of 0.91 substantially outperforming traditional baselines such as logistic regression (AUC = 0.34), random forest (AUC = 0.57), and support vector machines (AUC = 0.47). Additional ablation studies reveal that the removal of attention or dimensionality reduction leads to moderate declines in performance, while eliminating the news component causes a steep drop in AUC to 0.46, underscoring the critical value of incorporating real-world context through unstructured text. These findings demonstrate that integrating agentic generative AI with deep learning can meaningfully improve early detection of commodity price shocks, offering a practical tool for economic planning and risk mitigation in volatile market environments while saving the very high costs of operating a full generative AI agents pipeline.

Abstract: This study examines how indoor and outdoor aesthetics, streetscapes, and neighborhood features shape customer satisfaction at eating and dining establishments (EDEs) across different urban contexts, varying in car dependency, in Washington, DC. Using review photos and street view images, computer vision models quantified perceived safety and visual appeal. Ordinal logistic regression analyzed their effects on Yelp ratings. Findings reveal that both indoor and outdoor environments significantly impact EDE ratings, while streetscape quality's influence diminishes in car-dependent areas. The study highlights the need for context-sensitive planning that integrates indoor and outdoor factors to enhance customer experiences in diverse settings.

<title>CarbonScaling: Extending Neural Scaling Laws for Carbon Footprint in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents \textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6 FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.

<title>What Makes "Good" Distractors for Object Hallucination Evaluation in Large Vision-Language Models?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06530</link>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains. Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs, significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

Abstract: Accurate classification of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) from peripheral blood smear images is essential for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. This study investigates the use of transfer learning with pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve diagnostic performance. To address the class imbalance in the dataset of 3,631 Hematologic and 7,644 ALL images, we applied extensive data augmentation techniques to create a balanced training set of 10,000 images per class. We evaluated several models, including ResNet50, ResNet101, and EfficientNet variants B0, B1, and B3. EfficientNet-B3 achieved the best results, with an F1-score of 94.30%, accuracy of 92.02%, andAUCof94.79%,outperformingpreviouslyreported methods in the C-NMCChallenge. Thesefindings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining data augmentation with advanced transfer learning models, particularly EfficientNet-B3, in developing accurate and robust diagnostic tools for hematologic malignancy detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate text embeddings from text data, producing vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and contextual relationships of words. However, the high dimensionality of these embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors. By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.

<title>Generative Bid Shading in Real-Time Bidding Advertising</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06550</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Bid shading plays a crucial role in Real-Time Bidding~(RTB) by adaptively adjusting the bid to avoid advertisers overspending. Existing mainstream two-stage methods, which first model bid landscapes and then optimize surplus using operations research techniques, are constrained by unimodal assumptions that fail to adapt for non-convex surplus curves and are vulnerable to cascading errors in sequential workflows. Additionally, existing discretization models of continuous values ignore the dependence between discrete intervals, reducing the model's error correction ability, while sample selection bias in bidding scenarios presents further challenges for prediction. To address these issues, this paper introduces Generative Bid Shading~(GBS), which comprises two primary components: (1) an end-to-end generative model that utilizes an autoregressive approach to generate shading ratios by stepwise residuals, capturing complex value dependencies without relying on predefined priors; and (2) a reward preference alignment system, which incorporates a channel-aware hierarchical dynamic network~(CHNet) as the reward model to extract fine-grained features, along with modules for surplus optimization and exploration utility reward alignment, ultimately optimizing both short-term and long-term surplus using group relative policy optimization~(GRPO). Extensive experiments on both offline and online A/B tests validate GBS's effectiveness. Moreover, GBS has been deployed on the Meituan DSP platform, serving billions of bid requests daily.

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the deepfake dataset by introducing an age-diverse deepfake dataset that will improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF, FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet, EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible, fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete dataset and implementation code are available at https://github.com/unishajoshi/age-diverse-deepfake-detection.

<title>From Label Error Detection to Correction: A Modular Framework and Benchmark for Object Detection Datasets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06556</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels, incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released benchmark.

Abstract: The ever-growing learning model size nowadays challenges the communication efficiency and privacy preservation of the traditional federated learning (FL). In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private (DP) over-the-air federated distillation (FD) framework, where wireless devices (WDs) periodically share noise-perturbed model outputs with the parameter server by harnessing the superposition property of multi-access channels. Accordingly, over-the-air FD enables the shared responsibility of the DP preservation on the low-dimensional disclosed signals among WDs. We study the communication-learning co-design problem in differentially private over-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the transmit power and DP requirements of WDs. The main challenge is rooted in the intractable learning and privacy analysis in over-the-air FD, together with the strong coupling among the decision variables spanning two timescales. To tackle this problem, we first derive the analytical learning convergence rate and privacy losses of WDs, based on which the optimal transceiver design per FD round and long-term training rounds decision are obtained in the closed forms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed differentially private over-the-air FD approach achieves a better learning-privacy trade-off with largely-reduced communication overhead than the conventional FL benchmarks.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model. Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs (MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography (CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

<title>Solving Pasur Using GPU-Accelerated Counterfactual Regret Minimization</title>

Abstract: Pasur is a fishing card game played over six rounds and is played similarly to games such as Cassino and Scopa, and Bastra. This paper introduces a CUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing efficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash equilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm for solving large imperfect-information games.
  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the large size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA tensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose the game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2) inherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by pairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This design reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and node connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a round-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and recursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach constructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$ nodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.
  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model to predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair value of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies by simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel using GPU acceleration.
  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms where the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as turn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains: how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising 509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos, making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations. Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets, ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline, requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity, which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention.

Abstract: A key goal of modern materials science is accelerating the pace of materials discovery. Self-driving labs, or systems that select experiments using machine learning and then execute them using automation, are designed to fulfil this promise by performing experiments faster, more intelligently, more reliably, and with richer metadata than conventional means. This review summarizes progress in understanding the degree to which SDLs accelerate learning by quantifying how much they reduce the number of experiments required for a given goal. The review begins by summarizing the theory underlying two key metrics, namely acceleration factor AF and enhancement factor EF, which quantify how much faster and better an algorithm is relative to a reference strategy. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, which reveals a wide range of AFs with a median of 6, and that tends to increase with the dimensionality of the space, reflecting an interesting blessing of dimensionality. In contrast, reported EF values vary by over two orders of magnitude, although they consistently peak at 10-20 experiments per dimension. To understand these results, we perform a series of simulated Bayesian optimization campaigns that reveal how EF depends upon the statistical properties of the parameter space while AF depends on its complexity. Collectively, these results reinforce the motivation for using SDLs by revealing their value across a wide range of material parameter spaces and provide a common language for quantifying and understanding this acceleration.

<title>Federated Online Learning for Heterogeneous Multisource Streaming Data</title>

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as an essential paradigm for distributed multi-source data analysis under privacy concerns. Most existing federated learning methods focus on the ``static" datasets. However, in many real-world applications, data arrive continuously over time, forming streaming datasets. This introduces additional challenges for data storage and algorithm design, particularly under high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a federated online learning (FOL) method for distributed multi-source streaming data analysis. To account for heterogeneity, a personalized model is constructed for each data source, and a novel ``subgroup" assumption is employed to capture potential similarities, thereby enhancing model performance. We adopt the penalized renewable estimation method and the efficient proximal gradient descent for model training. The proposed method aligns with both federated and online learning frameworks: raw data are not exchanged among sources, ensuring data privacy, and only summary statistics of previous data batches are required for model updates, significantly reducing storage demands. Theoretically, we establish the consistency properties for model estimation, variable selection, and subgroup structure recovery, demonstrating optimal statistical efficiency. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, when applied to the financial lending data and the web log data, the proposed method also exhibits advantageous prediction performance. Results of the analysis also provide some practical insights.

Abstract: By applying interpretable machine learning methods such as decision trees, we study how simple models can classify the Galois groups of Galois extensions over $\mathbb{Q}$ of degrees 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10, using Dedekind zeta coefficients. Our interpretation of the machine learning results allows us to understand how the distribution of zeta coefficients depends on the Galois group, and to prove new criteria for classifying the Galois groups of these extensions. Combined with previous results, this work provides another example of a new paradigm in mathematical research driven by machine learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for knowledge-intensive tasks across domains. In materials science, to find novel materials for various energy efficient devices for various real-world applications, requires several time and cost expensive simulations and experiments. In order to tune down the uncharted material search space, minimizing the experimental cost, LLMs can play a bigger role to first provide an accelerated search of promising known material candidates. Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with domain-specific information via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is poised to revolutionize how researchers predict materials structures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge from literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG in accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic review to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key materials science problems. We survey state-of-the-art developments in crystal structure prediction, defect analysis, materials discovery, literature mining, database integration, and multi-modal retrieval, highlighting how combining LLMs with external knowledge sources enables new capabilities. We discuss the performance, limitations, and implications of these approaches, and outline future directions for leveraging LLMs to accelerate materials research and discovery for advancement in technologies in the area of electronics, optics, biomedical, and energy storage.

<title>A Tight Lower Bound for the Approximation Guarantee of Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition</title>

Abstract: We prove that the classic approximation guarantee for the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is tight by constructing a tensor for which HOSVD achieves an approximation ratio of $N/(1+\varepsilon)$, for any $\varepsilon > 0$. This matches the upper bound of De Lathauwer et al. (2000a) and shows that the approximation ratio of HOSVD cannot be improved. Using a more advanced construction, we also prove that the approximation guarantees for the ST-HOSVD algorithm of Vannieuwenhoven et al. (2012) and higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) of De Lathauwer et al. (2000b) are tight by showing that they can achieve their worst-case approximation ratio of $N / (1 + \varepsilon)$, for any $\varepsilon > 0$.

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence, the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks, has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset.

Abstract: Differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have proven effective at finding approximate rule-based solutions to link prediction and node classification problems on knowledge graphs; however, the common assumption of chain-like rule structure can hamper the performance and interpretability of existing approaches. We introduce GLIDR, a differentiable rule learning method that models the inference of logic rules with more expressive syntax than previous methods. GLIDR uses a differentiable message passing inference algorithm that generalizes previous chain-like rule learning methods to allow rules with features like branches and cycles. GLIDR has a simple and expressive rule search space which is parameterized by a limit on the maximum number of free variables that may be included in a rule. Explicit logic rules can be extracted from the weights of a GLIDR model for use with symbolic solvers. We demonstrate that GLIDR can significantly outperform existing rule learning methods on knowledge graph completion tasks and even compete with embedding methods despite the inherent disadvantage of being a structure-only prediction method. We show that rules extracted from GLIDR retain significant predictive performance, and that GLIDR is highly robust to training data noise. Finally, we demonstrate that GLIDR can be chained with deep neural networks and optimized end-to-end for rule learning on arbitrary data modalities.

Abstract: Ensemble datasets are ever more prevalent in various scientific domains. In climate science, ensemble datasets are used to capture variability in projections under plausible future conditions including greenhouse and aerosol emissions. Each ensemble model run produces projections that are fundamentally similar yet meaningfully distinct. Understanding this variability among ensemble model runs and analyzing its magnitude and patterns is a vital task for climate scientists. In this paper, we present ClimateSOM, a visual analysis workflow that leverages a self-organizing map (SOM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support interactive exploration and interpretation of climate ensemble datasets. The workflow abstracts climate ensemble model runs - spatiotemporal time series - into a distribution over a 2D space that captures the variability among the ensemble model runs using a SOM. LLMs are integrated to assist in sensemaking of this SOM-defined 2D space, the basis for the visual analysis tasks. In all, ClimateSOM enables users to explore the variability among ensemble model runs, identify patterns, compare and cluster the ensemble model runs. To demonstrate the utility of ClimateSOM, we apply the workflow to an ensemble dataset of precipitation projections over California and the Northwestern United States. Furthermore, we conduct a short evaluation of our LLM integration, and conduct an expert review of the visual workflow and the insights from the case studies with six domain experts to evaluate our approach and its utility.

<title>Mitigating Distribution Shift in Graph-Based Android Malware Classification via Function Metadata and LLM Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Graph-based malware classifiers can achieve over 94% accuracy on standard Android datasets, yet we find they suffer accuracy drops of up to 45% when evaluated on previously unseen malware variants from the same family - a scenario where strong generalization would typically be expected. This highlights a key limitation in existing approaches: both the model architectures and their structure-only representations often fail to capture deeper semantic patterns. In this work, we propose a robust semantic enrichment framework that enhances function call graphs with contextual features, including function-level metadata and, when available, code embeddings derived from large language models. The framework is designed to operate under real-world constraints where feature availability is inconsistent, and supports flexible integration of semantic signals. To evaluate generalization under realistic domain and temporal shifts, we introduce two new benchmarks: MalNet-Tiny-Common and MalNet-Tiny-Distinct, constructed using malware family partitioning to simulate cross-family generalization and evolving threat behavior. Experiments across multiple graph neural network backbones show that our method improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution shift and consistently enhances robustness when integrated with adaptation-based methods. These results offer a practical path toward building resilient malware detection systems in evolving threat environments.

Abstract: Solving Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems often requires substantial computational resources due to their combinatorial nature. Parallelization has emerged as a critical strategy to accelerate solution times and enhance scalability to tackle large, complex instances. This paper investigates the parallelization capabilities of Balans, a recently proposed multi-armed bandits-based adaptive large neighborhood search for MIPs. While Balans's modular architecture inherently supports parallel exploration of diverse parameter configurations, this potential has not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, we introduce ParBalans, an extension that leverages both solver-level and algorithmic-level parallelism to improve performance on challenging MIP instances. Our experimental results demonstrate that ParBalans exhibits competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art commercial solver Gurobi, particularly on hard optimization benchmarks.

<title>Learning Causal Structure Distributions for Robust Planning</title>

Abstract: Structural causal models describe how the components of a robotic system interact. They provide both structural and functional information about the relationships that are present in the system. The structural information outlines the variables among which there is interaction. The functional information describes how such interactions work, via equations or learned models. In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while accounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more robust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using significantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common model-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage the sparsity of interactions in robotic systems. We achieve this by estimating a causal structure distribution that is used to sample causal graphs that inform the latent-space representations in an encoder-multidecoder probabilistic model. We show that our model can be used to learn the dynamics of a robot, which together with a sampling-based planner can be used to perform new tasks in novel environments, provided an objective function for the new requirement is available. We validate our method using manipulators and mobile robots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the learned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and changes in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world robotics scenarios.

Abstract: The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp) used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model inference. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs and edge devices, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM models.

Abstract: Analyzing literature involves tracking interactions between characters, locations, and themes. Visualization has the potential to facilitate the mapping and analysis of these complex relationships, but capturing structured information from unstructured story data remains a challenge. As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, we see an opportunity to use their text processing and analysis capabilities to augment and reimagine existing storyline visualization techniques. Toward this goal, we introduce an LLM-driven data parsing pipeline that automatically extracts relevant narrative information from novels and scripts. We then apply this pipeline to create Story Ribbons, an interactive visualization system that helps novice and expert literary analysts explore detailed character and theme trajectories at multiple narrative levels. Through pipeline evaluations and user studies with Story Ribbons on 36 literary works, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to streamline narrative visualization creation and reveal new insights about familiar stories. We also describe current limitations of AI-based systems, and interaction motifs designed to address these issues.

<title>BiXSE: Improving Dense Retrieval via Probabilistic Graded Relevance Distillation</title>

Abstract: Neural sentence embedding models for dense retrieval typically rely on binary relevance labels, treating query-document pairs as either relevant or irrelevant. However, real-world relevance often exists on a continuum, and recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it feasible to scale the generation of fine-grained graded relevance labels. In this work, we propose BiXSE, a simple and effective pointwise training method that optimizes binary cross-entropy (BCE) over LLM-generated graded relevance scores. BiXSE interprets these scores as probabilistic targets, enabling granular supervision from a single labeled query-document pair per query. Unlike pairwise or listwise losses that require multiple annotated comparisons per query, BiXSE achieves strong performance with reduced annotation and compute costs by leveraging in-batch negatives. Extensive experiments across sentence embedding (MMTEB) and retrieval benchmarks (BEIR, TREC-DL) show that BiXSE consistently outperforms softmax-based contrastive learning (InfoNCE), and matches or exceeds strong pairwise ranking baselines when trained on LLM-supervised data. BiXSE offers a robust, scalable alternative for training dense retrieval models as graded relevance supervision becomes increasingly accessible.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in modeling graph-structured data, while Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer high energy efficiency through sparse, event-driven computation. However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.

Abstract: Many have observed that the development and deployment of generative machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models follow a distinctive pattern in which pre-trained models are adapted and fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. However, there is limited empirical work that examines the structure of these interactions. This paper analyzes 1.86 million models on Hugging Face, a leading peer production platform for model development. Our study of model family trees -- networks that connect fine-tuned models to their base or parent -- reveals sprawling fine-tuning lineages that vary widely in size and structure. Using an evolutionary biology lens to study ML models, we use model metadata and model cards to measure the genetic similarity and mutation of traits over model families. We find that models tend to exhibit a family resemblance, meaning their genetic markers and traits exhibit more overlap when they belong to the same model family. However, these similarities depart in certain ways from standard models of asexual reproduction, because mutations are fast and directed, such that two `sibling' models tend to exhibit more similarity than parent/child pairs. Further analysis of the directional drifts of these mutations reveals qualitative insights about the open machine learning ecosystem: Licenses counter-intuitively drift from restrictive, commercial licenses towards permissive or copyleft licenses, often in violation of upstream license's terms; models evolve from multi-lingual compatibility towards english-only compatibility; and model cards reduce in length and standardize by turning, more often, to templates and automatically generated text. Overall, this work takes a step toward an empirically grounded understanding of model fine-tuning and suggests that ecological models and methods can yield novel scientific insights.

<title>A Score-based Diffusion Model Approach for Adaptive Learning of Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Solutions</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the time-evolving solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) using score-based diffusion models within a recursive Bayesian inference setting. SPDEs play a central role in modeling complex physical systems under uncertainty, but their numerical solutions often suffer from model errors and reduced accuracy due to incomplete physical knowledge and environmental variability. To address these challenges, we encode the governing physics into the score function of a diffusion model using simulation data and incorporate observational information via a likelihood-based correction in a reverse-time stochastic differential equation. This enables adaptive learning through iterative refinement of the solution as new data becomes available. To improve computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we introduce the ensemble score filter, a training-free approximation of the score function designed for real-time inference. Numerical experiments on benchmark SPDEs demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under sparse and noisy observations.

Abstract: High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) has attracted significant attention in recent research. However, existing methods have mainly focused on optimizing in continuous domains, while combinatorial (ordinal and categorical) and mixed domains still remain challenging. In this paper, we first propose MOCA-HESP, a novel high-dimensional BO method for combinatorial and mixed variables. The key idea is to leverage the hyper-ellipsoid space partitioning (HESP) technique with different categorical encoders to work with high-dimensional, combinatorial and mixed spaces, while adaptively selecting the optimal encoders for HESP using a multi-armed bandit technique. Our method, MOCA-HESP, is designed as a \textit{meta-algorithm} such that it can incorporate other combinatorial and mixed BO optimizers to further enhance the optimizers' performance. Finally, we develop three practical BO methods by integrating MOCA-HESP with state-of-the-art BO optimizers for combinatorial and mixed variables: standard BO, CASMOPOLITAN, and Bounce. Our experimental results on various synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that our methods outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recently utilized in multi-access edge computing (MEC) as edge servers. It is desirable to design UAVs' trajectories and user to UAV assignments to ensure satisfactory service to the users and energy efficient operation simultaneously. The posed optimization problem is challenging to solve because: (i) The formulated problem is non-convex, (ii) Due to the mobility of ground users, their future positions and channel gains are not known in advance, (iii) Local UAVs' observations should be communicated to a central entity that solves the optimization problem. The (semi-) centralized processing leads to communication overhead, communication/processing bottlenecks, lack of flexibility and scalability, and loss of robustness to system failures. To simultaneously address all these limitations, we advocate a fully decentralized setup with no centralized entity. Each UAV obtains its local observation and then communicates with its immediate neighbors only. After sharing information with neighbors, each UAV determines its next position via a locally run deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. None of the UAVs need to know the global communication graph. Two main components of our proposed solution are (i) Graph attention layers (GAT), and (ii) Experience and parameter sharing proximal policy optimization (EPS-PPO). Our proposed approach eliminates all the limitations of semi-centralized MADRL methods such as MAPPO and MA deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), while guaranteeing a better performance than independent local DRLs such as in IPPO. Numerical results reveal notable performance gains in several different criteria compared to the existing MADDPG algorithm, demonstrating the potential for offering a better performance, while utilizing local communications only.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for the Manipuri language
  using the Meitei Mayek script. Leveraging Tacotron 2 and HiFi-GAN, we introduce a neural TTS
  architecture adapted to support tonal phonology and under-resourced linguistic environments. We
  develop a phoneme mapping for Meitei Mayek to ARPAbet, curate a single-speaker dataset, and
  demonstrate intelligible and natural speech synthesis, validated through subjective and objective
  metrics. This system lays the groundwork for linguistic preservation and technological inclusion of

<title>Near-Optimal Convergence of Accelerated Gradient Methods under Generalized and $(L_0, L_1)$-Smoothness</title>

Abstract: We study first-order methods for convex optimization problems with functions $f$ satisfying the recently proposed $\ell$-smoothness condition $||\nabla^{2}f(x)|| \le \ell\left(||\nabla f(x)||\right),$ which generalizes the $L$-smoothness and $(L_{0},L_{1})$-smoothness. While accelerated gradient descent AGD is known to reach the optimal complexity $O(\sqrt{L} R / \sqrt{\varepsilon})$ under $L$-smoothness, where $\varepsilon$ is an error tolerance and $R$ is the distance between a starting and an optimal point, existing extensions to $\ell$-smoothness either incur extra dependence on the initial gradient, suffer exponential factors in $L_{1} R$, or require costly auxiliary sub-routines, leaving open whether an AGD-type $O(\sqrt{\ell(0)} R / \sqrt{\varepsilon})$ rate is possible for small-$\varepsilon$, even in the $(L_{0},L_{1})$-smoothness case.
  We resolve this open question. Leveraging a new Lyapunov function and designing new algorithms, we achieve $O(\sqrt{\ell(0)} R / \sqrt{\varepsilon})$ oracle complexity for small-$\varepsilon$ and virtually any $\ell$. For instance, for $(L_{0},L_{1})$-smoothness, our bound $O(\sqrt{L_0} R / \sqrt{\varepsilon})$ is provably optimal in the small-$\varepsilon$ regime and removes all non-constant multiplicative factors present in prior accelerated algorithms.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian) reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines (pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward. We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs, and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

Abstract: Integer and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (INLP, MINLP) are central to logistics, energy, and scheduling, but remain computationally challenging. This survey examines how machine learning and reinforcement learning can enhance exact optimization methods - particularly branch-and-bound (BB), without compromising global optimality. We cover discrete, continuous, and mixed-integer formulations, and highlight applications such as crew scheduling, vehicle routing, and hydropower planning. We introduce a unified BB framework that embeds learning-based strategies into branching, cut selection, node ordering, and parameter control. Classical algorithms are augmented using supervised, imitation, and reinforcement learning models to accelerate convergence while maintaining correctness. We conclude with a taxonomy of learning methods by solver class and learning paradigm, and outline open challenges in generalization, hybridization, and scaling intelligent solvers.

<title>Model-Agnostic Sentiment Distribution Stability Analysis for Robust LLM-Generated Texts Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has resulted in increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content, posing significant challenges in distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written language. Existing detection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned classifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to paraphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work, we propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated text by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our method is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to exhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display greater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two complementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment distribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering and semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five diverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3, GPT-4-0613, and LLaMa-3.3. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 16% and 11% F1 score improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively. Moreover, SentiDetect also shows greater robustness to paraphrasing, adversarial attacks, and text length variations, outperforming existing detectors in challenging scenarios.

<title>Automated Formalization via Conceptual Retrieval-Augmented LLMs</title>

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) require manual formalization, which is labor-intensive and demands expert knowledge. While automated formalization offers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination (e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and the semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language descriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven Retrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core mathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation. However, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is non-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic nature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal retrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a concept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical library for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions and 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we propose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level signals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with reranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval. Experiments on miniF2F, ProofNet, and our newly proposed AdvancedMath benchmark show that CRAMF can be seamlessly integrated into LLM-based autoformalizers, yielding consistent improvements in translation accuracy, achieving up to 62.1% and an average of 29.9% relative improvement.

Abstract: Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops, regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties. Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations, Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks, achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation, compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying patterns across the two methods compared.[...]

Abstract: Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is essential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This paper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for efficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our approach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile (MCPP), which bridges site-specific multipath propagation with antenna/beam configurations via closed-form analytical modeling. We adopt a decoupled ``blackbox-whitebox" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) learns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a physics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve convergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC) strategy that leverages ray-tracing priors and on-site calibration using RSRP data. Extensive simulations results demonstrate that NBF significantly outperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure blackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization, while maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a scalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in next-generation dense wireless networks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight, training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.

Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives. This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value. We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies suited to diverse deployment needs.

Abstract: We explore machine learning techniques for predicting Curie temperatures of magnetic materials using the NEMAD database. By augmenting the dataset with composition-based and domain-aware descriptors, we evaluate the performance of several machine learning models. We find that the Extra Trees Regressor delivers the best performance reaching an R^2 score of up to 0.85 $\pm$ 0.01 (cross-validated) for a balanced dataset. We employ the k-means clustering algorithm to gain insights into the performance of chemically distinct material groups. Furthermore, we perform the SHAP analysis to identify key physicochemical drivers of Curie behavior, such as average atomic number and magnetic moment. By employing explainable AI techniques, this analysis offers insights into the model's predictive behavior, thereby advancing scientific interpretability.

Abstract: With wireless devices increasingly forming a unified smart network for seamless, user-friendly operations, random access (RA) medium access control (MAC) design is considered a key solution for handling unpredictable data traffic from multiple terminals. However, it remains challenging to design an effective RA-based MAC protocol to minimize collisions and ensure transmission fairness across the devices. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) have been proposed to optimize RA performance, their reliance on centralized training and the significant overhead required for information collection can make real-world applications unrealistic. In this work, we adopt a fully decentralized MARL architecture, where policy learning does not rely on centralized tasks but leverages consensus-based information exchanges across devices. We design our MARL algorithm over an actor-critic (AC) network and propose exchanging only local rewards to minimize communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof of global convergence for our approach. Numerical experiments show that our proposed MARL algorithm can significantly improve RA network performance compared to other baselines.

<title>Neural Channel Knowledge Map Assisted Scheduling Optimization of Active IRSs in Multi-User Systems</title>

arXiv:2508.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) have potential for significant performance gains in next-generation wireless networks but face key challenges, notably severe double-pathloss and complex multi-user scheduling due to hardware constraints. Active IRSs partially address pathloss but still require efficient scheduling in cell-level multi-IRS multi-user systems, whereby the overhead/delay of channel state acquisition and the scheduling complexity both rise dramatically as the user density and channel dimensions increase. Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a novel scheduling framework based on neural Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), designing Transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) from historical channel/throughput measurements tagged with user positions. Specifically, two cascaded networks, LPS-Net and SE-Net, are designed to predict link power statistics (LPS) and ergodic SE accurately. We further propose a low-complexity Stable Matching-Iterative Balancing (SM-IB) scheduling algorithm. Numerical evaluations verify that the proposed neural CKM significantly enhances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, while the SM-IB algorithm effectively achieves near-optimal max-min throughput with greatly reduced complexity.

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) provides a scalable approach for updating factual knowledge in large language models without full retraining. While previous studies have demonstrated effectiveness in general domains and medical QA tasks, little attention has been paid to KE in multimodal medical scenarios. Unlike text-only settings, medical KE demands integrating updated knowledge with visual reasoning to support safe and interpretable clinical decisions. To address this gap, we propose MultiMedEdit, the first benchmark tailored to evaluating KE in clinical multimodal tasks. Our framework spans both understanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric suite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm comparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive experiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest that current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning, particularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency analysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs in real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only reveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid foundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the future.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is critical for latency-sensitive applications such as real-time captioning and meeting transcription. However, truly parallel ASR decoding remains challenging due to the sequential nature of autoregressive (AR) decoders and the context limitations of non-autoregressive (NAR) methods. While modern ASR encoders can process up to 30 seconds of audio at once, AR decoders still generate tokens sequentially, creating a latency bottleneck. We propose Whisfusion, the first framework to fuse a pre-trained Whisper encoder with a text diffusion decoder. This NAR architecture resolves the AR latency bottleneck by processing the entire acoustic context in parallel at every decoding step. A lightweight cross-attention adapter trained via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges the two modalities. We also introduce a batch-parallel, multi-step decoding strategy that improves accuracy by increasing the number of candidates with minimal impact on speed. Fine-tuned solely on LibriSpeech (960h), Whisfusion achieves a lower WER than Whisper-tiny (8.3% vs. 9.7%), and offers comparable latency on short audio. For longer utterances (>20s), it is up to 2.6x faster than the AR baseline, establishing a new, efficient operating point for long-form ASR. The implementation and training scripts are available at https://github.com/taeyoun811/Whisfusion.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of domains, but its performance might deteriorate when applied to target domains with limited data. Domain Adaptation (DA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a related source domain with abundant data. However, this adaptation process can introduce additional uncertainty, making it difficult to draw statistically valid conclusions from AD results. In this paper, we propose STAND-DA -- a novel framework for statistically rigorous Autoencoder-based AD after Representation Learning-based DA. Built on the Selective Inference (SI) framework, STAND-DA computes valid $p$-values for detected anomalies and rigorously controls the false positive rate below a pre-specified level $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). To address the computational challenges of applying SI to deep learning models, we develop the GPU-accelerated SI implementation, significantly enhancing both scalability and runtime performance. This advancement makes SI practically feasible for modern, large-scale deep architectures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the theoretical results and computational efficiency of the proposed STAND-DA method.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement. During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are available at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.

<title>Taking the Garbage Out of Data-Driven Prediction Across Climate Timescales</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) -- and specifically machine learning (ML) -- applications for climate prediction across timescales are proliferating quickly. The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data preprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional statistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill and confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly influenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model development, thus yielding the colloquialism "garbage in, garbage out." As such, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input data for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to decadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers, developers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate predictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such applications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are using are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in this article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with non-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data, and handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex distributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing techniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can create confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process. Ultimately, implementing the recommended practices set forth in this article will enhance the robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction studies.

Abstract: Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance plays a crucial role in heating the Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, affecting atmospheric dynamics over varying time scales. Although significant effort has been spent studying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little work to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar cycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995, leaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian deep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach by applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period between 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric Telescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar EUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides reliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the feasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of solar influences on Earth's climate over extended periods.

<title>Membership Inference Attacks with False Discovery Rate Control</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record was used to train a target model or not. To analyze and study these vulnerabilities, various MIA methods have been proposed. Despite the significance and popularity of MIAs, existing works on MIAs are limited in providing guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR), which refers to the expected proportion of false discoveries among the identified positive discoveries. However, it is very challenging to ensure the false discovery rate guarantees, because the underlying distribution is usually unknown, and the estimated non-member probabilities often exhibit interdependence. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we design a novel membership inference attack method, which can provide the guarantees on the false discovery rate. Additionally, we show that our method can also provide the marginal probability guarantee on labeling true non-member data as member data. Notably, our method can work as a wrapper that can be seamlessly integrated with existing MIA methods in a post-hoc manner, while also providing the FDR control. We perform the theoretical analysis for our method. Extensive experiments in various settings (e.g., the black-box setting and the lifelong learning setting) are also conducted to verify the desirable performance of our method.

<title>SEF-MK: Speaker-Embedding-Free Voice Anonymization through Multi-k-means Quantization</title>

Abstract: Voice anonymization protects speaker privacy by concealing identity while preserving linguistic and paralinguistic content. Self-supervised learning (SSL) representations encode linguistic features but preserve speaker traits. We propose a novel speaker-embedding-free framework called SEF-MK. Instead of using a single k-means model trained on the entire dataset, SEF-MK anonymizes SSL representations for each utterance by randomly selecting one of multiple k-means models, each trained on a different subset of speakers. We explore this approach from both attacker and user perspectives. Extensive experiments show that, compared to a single k-means model, SEF-MK with multiple k-means models better preserves linguistic and emotional content from the user's viewpoint. However, from the attacker's perspective, utilizing multiple k-means models boosts the effectiveness of privacy attacks. These insights can aid users in designing voice anonymization systems to mitigate attacker threats.

Abstract: The quest for effective quantum feature maps for data encoding presents significant challenges, particularly due to the flat training landscapes and lengthy training processes associated with parameterised quantum circuits. To address these issues, we propose an evolutionary training-free quantum architecture search (QAS) framework that employs circuit-based heuristics focused on trainability, hardware robustness, generalisation ability, expressivity, complexity, and kernel-target alignment. By ranking circuit architectures with various proxies, we reduce evaluation costs and incorporate hardware-aware circuits to enhance robustness against noise. We evaluate our approach on classification tasks (using quantum support vector machine) across diverse datasets using both artificial and quantum-generated datasets. Our approach demonstrates competitive accuracy on both simulators and real quantum hardware, surpassing state-of-the-art QAS methods in terms of sampling efficiency and achieving up to a 2x speedup in architecture search runtime.

<title>AugLift: Boosting Generalization in Lifting-based 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07112</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07112</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly improves generalization performance without requiring additional data collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models (e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$, while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code will be made publicly available.

<title>Sensory robustness through top-down feedback and neural stochasticity in recurrent vision models</title>

Abstract: Biological systems leverage top-down feedback for visual processing, yet most artificial vision models succeed in image classification using purely feedforward or recurrent architectures, calling into question the functional significance of descending cortical pathways. Here, we trained convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNN) on image classification in the presence or absence of top-down feedback projections to elucidate the specific computational contributions of those feedback pathways. We found that ConvRNNs with top-down feedback exhibited remarkable speed-accuracy trade-off and robustness to noise perturbations and adversarial attacks, but only when they were trained with stochastic neural variability, simulated by randomly silencing single units via dropout. By performing detailed analyses to identify the reasons for such benefits, we observed that feedback information substantially shaped the representational geometry of the post-integration layer, combining the bottom-up and top-down streams, and this effect was amplified by dropout. Moreover, feedback signals coupled with dropout optimally constrained network activity onto a low-dimensional manifold and encoded object information more efficiently in out-of-distribution regimes, with top-down information stabilizing the representational dynamics at the population level. Together, these findings uncover a dual mechanism for resilient sensory coding. On the one hand, neural stochasticity prevents unit-level co-adaptation albeit at the cost of more chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, top-down feedback harnesses high-level information to stabilize network activity on compact low-dimensional manifolds.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) in creative contexts can go beyond transparency to support artistic engagement, modifiability, and sustained practice. While curated datasets and training human-scale models can offer artists greater agency and control, large-scale generative models like text-to-image diffusion systems often obscure these possibilities. We suggest that even large models can be treated as creative materials if their internal structure is exposed and manipulable. We propose a craft-based approach to explainability rooted in long-term, hands-on engagement akin to Sch\"on's "reflection-in-action" and demonstrate its application through a model-bending and inspection plugin integrated into the node-based interface of ComfyUI. We demonstrate that by interactively manipulating different parts of a generative model, artists can develop an intuition about how each component influences the output.

<title>DySK-Attn: A Framework for Efficient, Real-Time Knowledge Updating in Large Language Models via Dynamic Sparse Knowledge Attention</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search, efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the ever-changing world.

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs (PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at https://haiv-lab.github.io/openhaiv .

Abstract: This paper introduces the use of static electromagnetic skins (EMSs) to enable robust device localization via channel charting (CC) in realistic urban environments. We develop a rigorous optimization framework that leverages EMS to enhance channel dissimilarity and spatial fingerprinting, formulating EMS phase profile design as a codebook-based problem targeting the upper quantiles of key embedding metric, localization error, trustworthiness, and continuity. Through 3D ray-traced simulations of a representative city scenario, we demonstrate that optimized EMS configurations, in addition to significant improvement of the average positioning error, reduce the 90th-percentile localization error from over 60 m (no EMS) to less than 25 m, while drastically improving trustworthiness and continuity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit Smart Radio Environment (SRE) with static EMS for enhancing CC, achieving substantial gains in localization performance under challenging None-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions.

Abstract: While beam search improves speech recognition quality over greedy decoding, standard implementations are slow, often sequential, and CPU-bound. To fully leverage modern hardware capabilities, we present a novel open-source FlexCTC toolkit for fully GPU-based beam decoding, designed for Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) models. Developed entirely in Python and PyTorch, it offers a fast, user-friendly, and extensible alternative to traditional C++, CUDA, or WFST-based decoders. The toolkit features a high-performance, fully batched GPU implementation with eliminated CPU-GPU synchronization and minimized kernel launch overhead via CUDA Graphs. It also supports advanced contextualization techniques, including GPU-powered N-gram language model fusion and phrase-level boosting. These features enable accurate and efficient decoding, making them suitable for both research and production use.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly contributed to the development of equitable AI systems capable of factual question-answering (QA). However, no known study tests the LLMs' robustness when presented with obfuscated versions of questions. To systematically evaluate these limitations, we propose a novel technique, ObfusQAte and, leveraging the same, introduce ObfusQA, a comprehensive, first of its kind, framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels designed to examine LLM capabilities across three distinct dimensions: (i) Named-Entity Indirection, (ii) Distractor Indirection, and (iii) Contextual Overload. By capturing these fine-grained distinctions in language, ObfusQA provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness and adaptability. Our study observes that LLMs exhibit a tendency to fail or generate hallucinated responses when confronted with these increasingly nuanced variations. To foster research in this direction, we make ObfusQAte publicly available.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding, chemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate phenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics. Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general, flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and longitudinal datasets.

Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across various domains.

Abstract: Automating penetration testing is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity, yet current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations in this domain, including poor error handling, inefficient reasoning, and an inability to perform complex end-to-end tasks autonomously. To address these challenges, we introduce Pentest-R1, a novel framework designed to optimize LLM reasoning capabilities for this task through a two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline. We first construct a dataset of over 500 real-world, multi-step walkthroughs, which Pentest-R1 leverages for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to instill foundational attack logic. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via online RL in an interactive Capture The Flag (CTF) environment, where it learns directly from environmental feedback to develop robust error self-correction and adaptive strategies. Our extensive experiments on the Cybench and AutoPenBench benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. On AutoPenBench, Pentest-R1 achieves a 24.2\% success rate, surpassing most state-of-the-art models and ranking second only to Gemini 2.5 Flash. On Cybench, it attains a 15.0\% success rate in unguided tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for open-source LLMs and matching the performance of top proprietary models. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy of both training stages is critical to its success.

Abstract: This work presents a statistical mechanics characterization of neural networks, motivated by the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in spin glasses. A Hopfield-type spin glass model is constructed from a given feedforward neural network (FNN). Overlaps between simulated replica samples serve as a characteristic descriptor of the FNN. The connection between the spin-glass description and commonly studied properties of the FNN -- such as data fitting, capacity, generalization, and robustness -- has been investigated and empirically demonstrated. Unlike prior analytical studies that focus on model ensembles, this method provides a computable descriptor for individual network instances, which reveals nontrivial structural properties that are not captured by conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy. Preliminary results suggests its potential for practical applications such as model inspection, safety verification, and detection of hidden vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.

Abstract: In this study, we wish to showcase the unique utility of large language models (LLMs) in financial semantic annotation and alpha signal discovery. Leveraging a corpus of company-related tweets, we use an LLM to automatically assign multi-label event categories to high-sentiment-intensity tweets. We align these labeled sentiment signals with forward returns over 1-to-7-day horizons to evaluate their statistical efficacy and market tradability. Our experiments reveal that certain event labels consistently yield negative alpha, with Sharpe ratios as low as -0.38 and information coefficients exceeding 0.05, all statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level. This study establishes the feasibility of transforming unstructured social media text into structured, multi-label event variables. A key contribution of this work is its commitment to transparency and reproducibility; all code and methodologies are made publicly available. Our results provide compelling evidence that social media sentiment is a valuable, albeit noisy, signal in financial forecasting and underscore the potential of open-source frameworks to democratize algorithmic trading research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in high-resource settings, but often misinterpret long-tail cultural entities and underperform in low-resource languages. To address this gap, we propose a data-centric approach that directly grounds MLLMs in cultural knowledge. Leveraging a large scale knowledge graph from Wikidata, we collect images that represent culturally significant entities, and generate synthetic multilingual visual question answering data. The resulting dataset, CulturalGround, comprises 22 million high-quality, culturally-rich VQA pairs spanning 42 countries and 39 languages. We train an open-source MLLM CulturalPangea on CulturalGround, interleaving standard multilingual instruction-tuning data to preserve general abilities. CulturalPangea achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on various culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks, outperforming prior models by an average of 5.0 without degrading results on mainstream vision-language tasks. Our findings show that our targeted, culturally grounded approach could substantially narrow the cultural gap in MLLMs and offer a practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems.

Abstract: We focus on the critical challenge of handling non-stationary data streams in online continual learning environments, where constrained storage capacity prevents complete retention of historical data, leading to catastrophic forgetting during sequential task training. To more effectively analyze and address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, we propose a novel continual learning framework from a statistical perspective. Our approach incorporates random effects across all model parameters and allows the dimension of parameters to diverge to infinity, offering a general formulation for continual learning problems. To efficiently process streaming data, we develop a Multi-step Newton Iteration algorithm that significantly reduces computational costs in certain scenarios by alleviating the burden of matrix inversion. Theoretically, we derive the asymptotic normality of the estimator, enabling subsequent statistical inference. Comprehensive validation through synthetic data experiments and two real datasets analyses demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: As the particle physics community needs higher and higher precisions in order to test our current model of the subatomic world, larger and larger datasets are necessary. With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.

Abstract: We present the first evaluation harness that enables any out-of-the-box, local, Large Language Models (LLMs) to play full-press Diplomacy without fine-tuning or specialized training. Previous work required frontier LLMs, or fine-tuning, due to the high complexity and information density of Diplomacy's game state. Combined with the high variance of matches, these factors made Diplomacy prohibitive for study. In this work, we used data-driven iteration to optimize a textual game state representation such that a 24B model can reliably complete matches without any fine tuning. We develop tooling to facilitate hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, and we present case studies on persuasion, aggressive playstyles, and performance across a range of models. We conduct a variety of experiments across many popular LLMs, finding the larger models perform the best, but the smaller models still play adequately. We also introduce Critical State Analysis: an experimental protocol for rapidly iterating and analyzing key moments in a game at depth. Our harness democratizes the evaluation of strategic reasoning in LLMs by eliminating the need for fine-tuning, and it provides insights into how these capabilities emerge naturally from widely used LLMs. Our code is available in the supplement and will be open sourced.

Abstract: Unequal error protection (UEP) coding that enables differentiated reliability levels within a transmitted message is essential for modern communication systems. Autoencoder (AE)-based code designs have shown promise in the context of learned equal error protection (EEP) coding schemes. However, their application to UEP remains largely unexplored, particularly at intermediate blocklengths, due to the increasing complexity of AE-based models. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of superposition coding and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding in conventional UEP schemes, we propose a structured AE-based architecture that extends AE-based UEP codes to substantially larger blocklengths while maintaining efficient training. By structuring encoding and decoding into smaller AE subblocks, our method provides a flexible framework for fine-tuning UEP reliability levels while adapting to diverse system parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed approach improves over established achievability bounds of randomized superposition coding-based UEP schemes with SIC decoding, making the proposed structured AE-based UEP codes a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation networks.

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further enhance performance.

Abstract: We study the approximation complexity of high-dimensional second-order elliptic PDEs with homogeneous boundary conditions on the unit hypercube, within the framework of Barron spaces. Under the assumption that the coefficients belong to suitably defined Barron spaces, we prove that the solution can be efficiently approximated by two-layer neural networks, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the expressive power of shallow networks in capturing high-dimensional PDE solutions under appropriate structural assumptions.

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts) are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher $\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025) shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements over the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

Abstract: For transradial amputees, robotic prosthetic hands promise to regain the capability to perform daily living activities. To advance next-generation prosthetic hand control design, it is crucial to address current shortcomings in robustness to out of lab artifacts, and generalizability to new environments. Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing datasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered in the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects, negatively affecting users' independence and quality of life.
  To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to generalize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO, despite 80% training accuracy, drop to 15% on unseen objects. (ii) we propose Grasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to infer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object's physical characteristics resulting in a significant 50.2% accuracy over unseen object types compared to 36.7% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.
  Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp Network (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp estimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively expanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC) enables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic projection accuracy by 5.6% (to 42.3%) with 3.5x speedup over the unseen object types. Over a real-world sample mix, it reaches 86% average accuracy (12.2% gain over edge-only), and 2.2x faster inference than Grasp-LLaVA alone.

<title>Disentangling Multiplex Spatial-Temporal Transition Graph Representation Learning for Socially Enhanced POI Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable) values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh) incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach, which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains (ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making (or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be extended to automatic control settings.

Abstract: While transformers excel in many settings, their application in the field of automated planning is limited. Prior work like PlanGPT, a state-of-the-art decoder-only transformer, struggles with extrapolation from easy to hard planning problems. This in turn stems from problem symmetries: planning tasks can be represented with arbitrary variable names that carry no meaning beyond being identifiers. This causes a combinatorial explosion of equivalent representations that pure transformers cannot efficiently learn from. We propose a novel contrastive learning objective to make transformers symmetry-aware and thereby compensate for their lack of inductive bias. Combining this with architectural improvements, we show that transformers can be efficiently trained for either plan-generation or heuristic-prediction. Our results across multiple planning domains demonstrate that our symmetry-aware training effectively and efficiently addresses the limitations of PlanGPT.

Abstract: Active Infrared thermography (AIRT) is a widely adopted non-destructive testing (NDT) technique for detecting subsurface anomalies in industrial components. Due to the high dimensionality of AIRT data, current approaches employ non-linear autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. However, the latent space learned by AIRT AEs lacks structure, limiting their effectiveness in downstream defect characterization tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a principal component analysis guided (PCA-guided) autoencoding framework for structured dimensionality reduction to capture intricate, non-linear features in thermographic signals while enforcing a structured latent space. A novel loss function, PCA distillation loss, is introduced to guide AIRT AEs to align the latent representation with structured PCA components while capturing the intricate, non-linear patterns in thermographic signals. To evaluate the utility of the learned, structured latent space, we propose a neural network-based evaluation metric that assesses its suitability for defect characterization. Experimental results show that the proposed PCA-guided AE outperforms state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods on PVC, CFRP, and PLA samples in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and neural network-based metrics.

Abstract: The design of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with high transformation temperatures and large mechanical work output remains a longstanding challenge in functional materials engineering. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs. Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal hysteresis of 29 {\deg}C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.

Abstract: The core role of medical images in disease diagnosis makes their quality directly affect the accuracy of clinical judgment. However, due to factors such as low-dose scanning, equipment limitations and imaging artifacts, medical images are often accompanied by non-uniform noise interference, which seriously affects structure recognition and lesion detection. This paper proposes a medical image adaptive denoising model (MI-ND) that integrates multi-scale convolutional and Transformer architecture, introduces a noise level estimator (NLE) and a noise adaptive attention module (NAAB), and realizes channel-spatial attention regulation and cross-modal feature fusion driven by noise perception. Systematic testing is carried out on multimodal public datasets. Experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the comparative methods in image quality indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, and improves the F1 score and ROC-AUC in downstream diagnostic tasks, showing strong prac-tical value and promotional potential. The model has outstanding benefits in structural recovery, diagnostic sensitivity, and cross-modal robustness, and provides an effective solution for medical image enhancement and AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

Abstract: Speaker Verification (SV) systems trained on adults speech often underperform on children's SV due to the acoustic mismatch, and limited children speech data makes fine-tuning not very effective. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework, a Gated Linear Unit adapter with Iterative Fine-Tuning (G-IFT), to enhance knowledge transfer efficiency between the high-resource adults speech domain and the low-resource children's speech domain. In this framework, a Gated Linear Unit adapter is first inserted between the pre-trained speaker embedding model and the classifier. Then the classifier, adapter, and pre-trained speaker embedding model are optimized sequentially in an iterative way. This framework is agnostic to the type of the underlying architecture of the SV system. Our experiments on ECAPA-TDNN, ResNet, and X-vector architectures using the OGI and MyST datasets demonstrate that the G-IFT framework yields consistent reductions in Equal Error Rates compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: In modern recommender systems, experimental settings typically include filtering out cold users and items based on a minimum interaction threshold. However, these thresholds are often chosen arbitrarily and vary widely across studies, leading to inconsistencies that can significantly affect the comparability and reliability of evaluation results. In this paper, we systematically explore the cold-start boundary by examining the criteria used to determine whether a user or an item should be considered cold. Our experiments incrementally vary the number of interactions for different items during training, and gradually update the length of user interaction histories during inference. We investigate the thresholds across several widely used datasets, commonly represented in recent papers from top-tier conferences, and on multiple established recommender baselines. Our findings show that inconsistent selection of cold-start thresholds can either result in the unnecessary removal of valuable data or lead to the misclassification of cold instances as warm, introducing more noise into the system.

However, existing vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck, manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands, limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of motion generation technologies in real-world applications.

<title>Unequal Uncertainty: Rethinking Algorithmic Interventions for Mitigating Discrimination from AI</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (AI) predictions poses urgent legal and ethical challenges for AI-assisted decision-making. We examine two algorithmic interventions that act as guardrails for human-AI collaboration: selective abstention, which withholds high-uncertainty predictions from human decision-makers, and selective friction, which delivers those predictions together with salient warnings or disclosures that slow the decision process. Research has shown that selective abstention based on uncertainty can inadvertently exacerbate disparities and disadvantage under-represented groups that disproportionately receive uncertain predictions. In this paper, we provide the first integrated socio-technical and legal analysis of uncertainty-based algorithmic interventions. Through two case studies, AI-assisted consumer credit decisions and AI-assisted content moderation, we demonstrate how the seemingly neutral use of uncertainty thresholds can trigger discriminatory impacts. We argue that, although both interventions pose risks of unlawful discrimination under UK law, selective frictions offer a promising pathway toward fairer and more accountable AI-assisted decision-making by preserving transparency and encouraging more cautious human judgment.

Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) algorithms allow clients in federated settings to exercise their ''right to be forgotten'' by removing the influence of their data from a collaboratively trained model. Existing FU methods maintain data privacy by performing unlearning locally on the client-side and sending targeted updates to the server without exposing forgotten data; yet they often rely on server-side cooperation, revealing the client's intent and identity without enforcement guarantees - compromising autonomy and unlearning privacy. In this work, we propose EFU (Enforced Federated Unlearning), a cryptographically enforced FU framework that enables clients to initiate unlearning while concealing its occurrence from the server. Specifically, EFU leverages functional encryption to bind encrypted updates to specific aggregation functions, ensuring the server can neither perform unauthorized computations nor detect or skip unlearning requests. To further mask behavioral and parameter shifts in the aggregated model, we incorporate auxiliary unlearning losses based on adversarial examples and parameter importance regularization. Extensive experiments show that EFU achieves near-random accuracy on forgotten data while maintaining performance comparable to full retraining across datasets and neural architectures - all while concealing unlearning intent from the server. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EFU is agnostic to the underlying unlearning algorithm, enabling secure, function-hiding, and verifiable unlearning for any client-side FU mechanism that issues targeted updates.

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer, and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop (HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images. The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature, with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Abstract: This work advances the theoretical foundations of reservoir computing (RC) by providing a unified treatment of fading memory and the echo state property (ESP) in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We investigate state-space systems, a central model class in time series learning, and establish that fading memory and solution stability hold generically -- even in the absence of the ESP -- offering a robust explanation for the empirical success of RC models without strict contractivity conditions. In the stochastic case, we critically assess stochastic echo states, proposing a novel distributional perspective rooted in attractor dynamics on the space of probability distributions, which leads to a rich and coherent theory. Our results extend and generalize previous work on non-autonomous dynamical systems, offering new insights into causality, stability, and memory in RC models. This lays the groundwork for reliable generative modeling of temporal data in both deterministic and stochastic regimes.

Abstract: Off-policy estimation (OPE) methods enable unbiased offline evaluation of recommender systems, directly estimating the online reward some target policy would have obtained, from offline data and with statistical guarantees. The theoretical elegance of the framework combined with practical successes have led to a surge of interest, with many competing estimators now available to practitioners and researchers. Among these, Doubly Robust methods provide a prominent strategy to combine value- and policy-based estimators.
  In this work, we take an alternative perspective to combine a set of OPE estimators and their associated confidence intervals into a single, more accurate estimate. Our approach leverages a correlated fixed-effects meta-analysis framework, explicitly accounting for dependencies among estimators that arise due to shared data. This yields a best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) of the target policy's value, along with an appropriately conservative confidence interval that reflects inter-estimator correlation. We validate our method on both simulated and real-world data, demonstrating improved statistical efficiency over existing individual estimators.

Abstract: Generative AI holds great potentials to automate and enhance data synthesis in nuclear medicine. However, the high-stakes nature of biomedical imaging necessitates robust mechanisms to detect and manage unexpected or erroneous model behavior. We introduce development and implementation of a hybrid anomaly detection framework to safeguard GenAI models in BIOEMTECH's eyes(TM) systems. Two applications are demonstrated: Pose2Xray, which generates synthetic X-rays from photographic mouse images, and DosimetrEYE, which estimates 3D radiation dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD) enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic bounds for accuracy of normal approximation for linear two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) algorithms driven by martingale difference or Markov noise. Focusing on both the last iterate and Polyak-Ruppert averaging regimes, we derive bounds for normal approximation in terms of the convex distance between probability distributions. Our analysis reveals a non-trivial interaction between the fast and slow timescales: the normal approximation rate for the last iterate improves as the timescale separation increases, while it decreases in the Polyak-Ruppert averaged setting. We also provide the high-order moment bounds for the error of linear TTSA algorithm, which may be of independent interest.

<title>Frequency-Domain Analysis of Time-Dependent Multiomic Data in Progressive Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Proposed Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach with Quaternionic Extensions</title>

Abstract: Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge deterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and neuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting predictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that transforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and Laplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and employs quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct serves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis of neurodegenerative diseases. We extend this to quaternionic representations with three imaginary axes ($i, j, k$) to model multistate Hamiltonians in multifaceted disorders, drawing from quantum neuromorphic computing to capture entangled neural dynamics \citep{Pehle2020, Emani2019}. This approach leverages quantum advantages in handling high-dimensional amplitude-phase data, enabling outlier detection and frequency signature analysis. Potential clinical applications include identifying high-risk patients with rapid progression or therapy resistance using s-domain biomarkers, supported by quantum machine learning (QML) precedents achieving up to 99.89% accuracy in Alzheimer's classification \citep{Belay2024, Bhowmik2025}. This framework aims to lay the groundwork for redefining precision medicine for neurodegenerative diseases through future validations.

Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning, hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts, with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor. By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical capacity constraints in forensic systems.

Abstract: Semantic communications (SemComs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for joint data and task-oriented transmissions, combining the demands for both the bit-accurate delivery and end-to-end (E2E) distortion minimization. However, current joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with the existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the sources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is suboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over parallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic source coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed and adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and channel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as functions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic regression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E distortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power allocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex approximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC scheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and parallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical digital systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel kernel-based nonparametric two-sample test, employing the combined use of kernel mean and kernel covariance embedding. Our test builds on recent results showing how such combined embeddings map distinct probability measures to mutually singular Gaussian measures on the kernel's RKHS. Leveraging this result, we construct a test statistic based on the relative entropy between the Gaussian embeddings, i.e.\ the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is specifically tailored to detect equality versus singularity of two Gaussians, and satisfies a ``$0/\infty$" law, in that it vanishes under the null and diverges under the alternative. To implement the test in finite samples, we introduce a regularised version, calibrated by way of permutation. We prove consistency, establish uniform power guarantees under mild conditions, and discuss how our framework unifies and extends prior approaches based on spectrally regularized MMD. Empirical results on synthetic and real data demonstrate remarkable gains in power compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-dimensional and weak-signal regimes.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved exponential tail bound for Beta distributions, refining a result in [15]. This improvement is achieved by interpreting their bound as a regular Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence one, while introducing a specific perturbation $\eta$ that shifts the mean of the Beta distribution closer to zero within the KL bound. Our contribution is to show that a larger perturbation can be chosen, thereby tightening the bound. We then extend this result from the Beta distribution to Dirichlet distributions and Dirichlet processes (DPs).

Abstract: Rigorous error estimation is a fundamental topic in numerical analysis. With the increasing use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations, several approaches have been developed to quantify the associated prediction error. In this work, we build upon a semigroup-based framework previously introduced by the authors for estimating the PINN error. While this estimator has so far been limited to academic examples - due to the need to compute quantities related to input-to-state stability - we extend its applicability to a significantly broader class of problems. This is accomplished by modifying the error bound and proposing numerical strategies to approximate the required stability parameters. The extended framework enables the certification of PINN predictions in more realistic scenarios, as demonstrated by a numerical study of Stokes flow around a cylinder.

Abstract: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), such as Massive Open Online Courses, offer new opportunities for human learning. At the core of such systems, knowledge tracing (KT) predicts students' future performance by analyzing their historical learning activities, enabling an accurate evaluation of students' knowledge states over time. We show that existing KT methods often encounter correlation conflicts when analyzing the relationships between historical learning sequences and future performance. To address such conflicts, we propose to extract so-called Follow-up Performance Trends (FPTs) from historical ITS data and to incorporate them into KT. We propose a method called Forward-Looking Knowledge Tracing (FINER) that combines historical learning sequences with FPTs to enhance student performance prediction accuracy. FINER constructs learning patterns that facilitate the retrieval of FPTs from historical ITS data in linear time; FINER includes a novel similarity-aware attention mechanism that aggregates FPTs based on both frequency and contextual similarity; and FINER offers means of combining FPTs and historical learning sequences to enable more accurate prediction of student future performance. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that FINER can outperform ten state-of-the-art KT methods, increasing accuracy by 8.74% to 84.85%.

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of power consumption in cities and micro-grids through the Internet of Things (IoT) can help forecast future demand and optimize grid operations. But moving all consumer-level usage data to the cloud for predictions and analysis at fine time scales can expose activity patterns. Federated Learning~(FL) is a privacy-sensitive collaborative DNN training approach that retains data on edge devices, trains the models on private data locally, and aggregates the local models in the cloud. But key challenges exist: (i) clients can have non-independently identically distributed~(non-IID) data, and (ii) the learning should be computationally cheap while scaling to 1000s of (unseen) clients. In this paper, we develop and evaluate several optimizations to FL training across edge and cloud for time-series demand forecasting in micro-grids and city-scale utilities using DNNs to achieve a high prediction accuracy while minimizing the training cost. We showcase the benefit of using exponentially weighted loss while training and show that it further improves the prediction of the final model. Finally, we evaluate these strategies by validating over 1000s of clients for three states in the US from the OpenEIA corpus, and performing FL both in a pseudo-distributed setting and a Pi edge cluster. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed methods over baselines like ARIMA and DNNs trained for individual consumers, which are not scalable.

Abstract: The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders, which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy, although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.

Abstract: Radiation response in cancer is shaped by complex, patient specific biology, yet current treatment strategies often rely on uniform dose prescriptions without accounting for tumor heterogeneity. In this study, we introduce a meta learning framework for one-shot prediction of radiosensitivity measured by SF2 using cell line level gene expression data. Unlike the widely used Radiosensitivity Index RSI a rank-based linear model trained on a fixed 10-gene signature, our proposed meta-learned model allows the importance of each gene to vary by sample through fine tuning. This flexibility addresses key limitations of static models like RSI, which assume uniform gene contributions across tumor types and discard expression magnitude and gene gene interactions. Our results show that meta learning offers robust generalization to unseen samples and performs well in tumor subgroups with high radiosensitivity variability, such as adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. By learning transferable structure across tasks while preserving sample specific adaptability, our approach enables rapid adaptation to individual samples, improving predictive accuracy across diverse tumor subtypes while uncovering context dependent patterns of gene influence that may inform personalized therapy.

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts. To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality, accelerated MRI reconstruction. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/multimodallearning/PrIINeR.

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

The simple nature of data collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules: an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900 student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students' lives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly available at https://github.com/lukasgehring/Assessing-LLM-Text-Detection-in-Educational-Contexts.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications such as artificial image synthesis. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.

Abstract: The Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) 2025 shared task is to model annotator disagreement through soft label distribution prediction and perspectivist evaluation, modeling annotators. We adapt DisCo (Distribution from Context), a neural architecture that jointly models item-level and annotator-level label distributions, and present detailed analysis and improvements. In this paper, we extend the DisCo by incorporating annotator metadata, enhancing input representations, and modifying the loss functions to capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth error and calibration analyses, highlighting the conditions under which improvements occur. Our findings underscore the value of disagreement-aware modeling and offer insights into how system components interact with the complexity of human-annotated data.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter. Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

Abstract: We propose a joint learning framework for Byzantine-resilient spectrum sensing and secure intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)--assisted opportunistic access under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. The sensing stage performs logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and attention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs with a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded number of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink design as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and signal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase shifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an augmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide provable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local curvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO) in a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP) surrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound (UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of the implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show higher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial attacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of eavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence. The framework offers a practical path to secure opportunistic communication that adapts to CSI availability while coherently coordinating sensing and transmission through joint learning.

Abstract: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality, require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content attribution.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are typically trained to synthesize data, from images and more recently tabular data, under the assumption of directly accessible training data. Recently, federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that features decentralized learning on client's local data with a privacy-preserving capability. And, while learning GANs to synthesize images on FL systems has just been demonstrated, it is unknown if GANs for tabular data can be learned from decentralized data sources. Moreover, it remains unclear which distributed architecture suits them best. Different from image GANs, state-of-the-art tabular GANs require prior knowledge on the data distribution of each (discrete and continuous) column to agree on a common encoding -- risking privacy guarantees. In this paper, we propose Fed-TGAN, the first Federated learning framework for Tabular GANs. To effectively learn a complex tabular GAN on non-identical participants, Fed-TGAN designs two novel features: (i) a privacy-preserving multi-source feature encoding for model initialization; and (ii) table similarity aware weighting strategies to aggregate local models for countering data skew. We extensively evaluate the proposed Fed-TGAN against variants of decentralized learning architectures on four widely used datasets. Results show that Fed-TGAN accelerates training time per epoch up to 200% compared to the alternative architectures, for both IID and Non-IID data. Overall, Fed-TGAN not only stabilizes the training loss, but also achieves better similarity between generated and original data. Our code is released at https://github.com/zhao-zilong/Fed-TGAN.

Abstract: We propose a novel interpretation technique to explain the behavior of structured output models, which learn mappings between an input vector to a set of output variables simultaneously. Because of the complex relationship between the computational path of output variables in structured models, a feature can affect the value of output through other ones. We focus on one of the outputs as the target and try to find the most important features utilized by the structured model to decide on the target in each locality of the input space. In this paper, we assume an arbitrary structured output model is available as a black box and argue how considering the correlations between output variables can improve the explanation performance. The goal is to train a function as an interpreter for the target output variable over the input space. We introduce an energy-based training process for the interpreter function, which effectively considers the structural information incorporated into the model to be explained. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed using a variety of simulated and real data sets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art multi-objective optimization often assumes a known utility function, learns it interactively, or computes the full Pareto front-each requiring costly expert input.~Real-world problems, however, involve implicit preferences that are hard to formalize. To reduce expert involvement, we propose an offline, interpretable utility learning method that uses expert knowledge, historical examples, and coarse information about the utility space to reduce sample requirements. We model uncertainty via a full Bayesian posterior and propagate it throughout the optimization process. Our method outperforms standard Gaussian processes and BOPE across four domains, showing strong performance even with biased samples, as encountered in the real-world, and limited expert input.

Abstract: AdaBoost is a classic boosting algorithm for combining multiple inaccurate classifiers produced by a weak learner, to produce a strong learner with arbitrarily high accuracy when given enough training data. Determining the optimal number of samples necessary to obtain a given accuracy of the strong learner, is a basic learning theoretic question. Larsen and Ritzert (NeurIPS'22) recently presented the first provably optimal weak-to-strong learner. However, their algorithm is somewhat complicated and it remains an intriguing question whether the prototypical boosting algorithm AdaBoost also makes optimal use of training samples. In this work, we answer this question in the negative. Concretely, we show that the sample complexity of AdaBoost, and other classic variations thereof, are sub-optimal by at least one logarithmic factor in the desired accuracy of the strong learner.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in various complex domains. However, identifying an effective policy via RL often necessitates extensive exploration. Imitation learning aims to mitigate this issue by using expert demonstrations to guide exploration. In real-world scenarios, one often has access to multiple suboptimal black-box experts, rather than a single optimal oracle. These experts do not universally outperform each other across all states, presenting a challenge in actively deciding which oracle to use and in which state. We introduce MAPS and MAPS-SE, a class of policy improvement algorithms that perform imitation learning from multiple suboptimal oracles. In particular, MAPS actively selects which of the oracles to imitate and improve their value function estimates, and MAPS-SE additionally leverages an active state exploration criterion to determine which states one should explore. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis and demonstrate that MAPS and MAPS-SE enjoy sample efficiency advantage over the state-of-the-art policy improvement algorithms. Empirical results show that MAPS-SE significantly accelerates policy optimization via state-wise imitation learning from multiple oracles across a broad spectrum of control tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising performance, its sample complexity continues to be a substantial hurdle, restricting its broader application across a variety of domains. Imitation learning (IL) utilizes oracles to improve sample efficiency, yet it is often constrained by the quality of the oracles deployed. which actively interleaves between IL and RL based on an online estimate of their performance. RPI draws on the strengths of IL, using oracle queries to facilitate exploration, an aspect that is notably challenging in sparse-reward RL, particularly during the early stages of learning. As learning unfolds, RPI gradually transitions to RL, effectively treating the learned policy as an improved oracle. This algorithm is capable of learning from and improving upon a diverse set of black-box oracles. Integral to RPI are Robust Active Policy Selection (RAPS) and Robust Policy Gradient (RPG), both of which reason over whether to perform state-wise imitation from the oracles or learn from its own value function when the learner's performance surpasses that of the oracles in a specific state. Empirical evaluations and theoretical analysis validate that RPI excels in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methodologies, demonstrating superior performance across various benchmark domains.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques make it possible to efficiently adapt a language model to create "expert" models that specialize to new tasks or domains. Recent techniques in model merging and compositional generalization leverage these expert models by dynamically composing modules to improve zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the efficiency of PEFT methods, the size of expert models can make it onerous to retrieve expert models per query over high-latency networks like the Internet or serve multiple experts on a single GPU. To address these issues, we present ComPEFT, a novel method for compressing fine-tuning residuals (task vectors) of PEFT based models. ComPEFT employs sparsification and ternary quantization to reduce the size of the PEFT module without performing any additional retraining while preserving or enhancing model performance. In extensive evaluation across T5, T0, and LLaMA-based models with 200M - 65B parameters, ComPEFT achieves compression ratios of 8x - 50x. In particular, we show that ComPEFT improves with scale - stronger models exhibit higher compressibility and better performance. For example, we show that ComPEFT applied to LLaMA outperforms QLoRA by 4.16% on MMLU with a storage size reduction of up to 26x. In addition, we show that the compressed experts produced by ComPEFT maintain few-shot compositional generalization capabilities, facilitate efficient communication and computation, and exhibit enhanced performance when merged. Lastly, we provide an analysis of different method components, compare it with other PEFT methods, and test ComPEFT's efficacy for compressing the residual of full-finetuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/prateeky2806/compeft.

Abstract: Multi-distribution learning (MDL), which seeks to learn a shared model that minimizes the worst-case risk across $k$ distinct data distributions, has emerged as a unified framework in response to the evolving demand for robustness, fairness, multi-group collaboration, etc. Achieving data-efficient MDL necessitates adaptive sampling, also called on-demand sampling, throughout the learning process. However, there exist substantial gaps between the state-of-the-art upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity. Focusing on a hypothesis class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension d, we propose a novel algorithm that yields an varepsilon-optimal randomized hypothesis with a sample complexity on the order of (d+k)/varepsilon^2 (modulo some logarithmic factor), matching the best-known lower bound. Our algorithmic ideas and theory are further extended to accommodate Rademacher classes. The proposed algorithms are oracle-efficient, which access the hypothesis class solely through an empirical risk minimization oracle.
  Additionally, we establish the necessity of randomization, revealing a large sample size barrier when only deterministic hypotheses are permitted. These findings resolve three open problems presented in COLT 2023 (i.e., citet[Problems 1, 3 and 4]{awasthi2023sample}).

Abstract: The theory of Bayesian learning incorporates the use of Student-t Processes to model heavy-tailed distributions and datasets with outliers. However, despite Student-t Processes having a similar computational complexity as Gaussian Processes, there has been limited emphasis on the sparse representation of this model. This is mainly due to the increased difficulty in modeling and computation compared to previous sparse Gaussian Processes. Our motivation is to address the need for a sparse representation framework that reduces computational complexity, allowing Student-t Processes to be more flexible for real-world datasets. To achieve this, we leverage the conditional distribution of Student-t Processes to introduce sparse inducing points. Bayesian methods and variational inference are then utilized to derive a well-defined lower bound, facilitating more efficient optimization of our model through stochastic gradient descent. We propose two methods for computing the variational lower bound, one utilizing Monte Carlo sampling and the other employing Jensen's inequality to compute the KL regularization term in the loss function. We propose adopting these approaches as viable alternatives to Gaussian processes when the data might contain outliers or exhibit heavy-tailed behavior, and we provide specific recommendations for their applicability. We evaluate the two proposed approaches on various synthetic and real-world datasets from UCI and Kaggle, demonstrating their effectiveness compared to baseline methods in terms of computational complexity and accuracy, as well as their robustness to outliers.

Abstract: Kernel herding belongs to a family of deterministic quadratures that seek to minimize the worst-case integration error over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). These quadrature rules come with strong experimental evidence that this worst-case error decreases at a faster rate than the standard square root of the number of quadrature nodes. This conjectured fast rate is key for integrating expensive-to-evaluate functions, as in Bayesian inference of expensive models, and makes up for the increased computational cost of sampling, compared to i.i.d. or MCMC quadratures. However, there is little theoretical support for this faster-than-square-root rate, at least in the usual case where the RKHS is infinite-dimensional, while recent progress on distribution compression suggests that results on the direct minimization of worst-case integration are possible. In this paper, we study a joint probability distribution over quadrature nodes, whose support tends to minimize the same worst-case error as kernel herding. Our main contribution is to prove that it does outperform i.i.d Monte Carlo, in the sense of coming with a tighter concentration inequality on the worst-case integration error. This first step towards proving a fast error decay demonstrates that the mathematical toolbox developed around Gibbs measures can help understand to what extent kernel herding and its variants improve on computationally cheaper methods. Moreover, we investigate the computational bottlenecks of approximately sampling our quadrature, and we demonstrate on toy examples that a faster rate of convergence, though not worst-case, is likely.

Abstract: The use of Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) has shown great promise in the ongoing research effort to tackle sample inefficiency in Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, choosing the right potential function remains an open challenge. Additionally, RL techniques are usually constrained to use a finite horizon for computational limitations, which introduces a bias when using PBRS. In this paper, we first build some theoretically-grounded intuition on why selecting the potential function as the optimal value function of the task at hand produces performance advantages. We then analyse the bias induced by finite horizons in the context of PBRS producing novel insights. Finally, leveraging abstractions as a way to approximate the optimal value function of the given task, we assess the sample efficiency and performance impact of PBRS on four environments including a goal-oriented navigation task and three Arcade Learning Environments (ALE) games. Remarkably, experimental results show that we can reach the same level of performance as CNN-based solutions with a simple fully-connected network.

Abstract: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires ``conditional fairness'' tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for assessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.

Abstract: Deriving meaningful representations from complex, high-dimensional data in unsupervised settings is crucial across diverse machine learning applications. This paper introduces a framework for multi-scale graph network embedding based on spectral graph wavelets that employs a contrastive learning approach. We theoretically show that in Paley-Wiener spaces on combinatorial graphs, the spectral graph wavelets operator provides greater flexibility and control over smoothness compared to the Laplacian operator, motivating our approach. A key advantage of the proposed embedding is its ability to establish a correspondence between the embedding and input feature spaces, enabling the derivation of feature importance. We validate the effectiveness of our graph embedding framework on multiple public datasets across various downstream tasks, including clustering and unsupervised feature importance.

Abstract: Training strategies for modern deep neural networks (NNs) tend to induce a heavy-tailed (HT) empirical spectral density (ESD) in the layer weights. While previous efforts have shown that the HT phenomenon correlates with good generalization in large NNs, a theoretical explanation of its occurrence is still lacking. Especially, understanding the conditions which lead to this phenomenon can shed light on the interplay between generalization and weight spectra. Our work aims to bridge this gap by presenting a simple, rich setting to model the emergence of HT ESD. In particular, we present a theory-informed setup for 'crafting' heavy tails in the ESD of two-layer NNs and present a systematic analysis of the HT ESD emergence without any gradient noise. This is the first work to analyze a noise-free setting, and we also incorporate optimizer (GD/Adam) dependent (large) learning rates into the HT ESD analysis. Our results highlight the role of learning rates on the Bulk+Spike and HT shape of the ESDs in the early phase of training, which can facilitate generalization in the two-layer NN. These observations shed light on the behavior of large-scale NNs, albeit in a much simpler setting.

Abstract: The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to a particular domain or task. Model MoErging methods aim to recycle expert models to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. A key component of MoErging methods is the creation of a router that decides which expert model(s) to use for a particular input or application. The promise, effectiveness, and large design space of MoErging has spurred the development of many new methods over the past few years. This rapid pace of development has made it challenging to compare different MoErging methods, which are rarely compared to one another and are often validated in different experimental setups. To remedy such gaps, we present a comprehensive survey of MoErging methods that includes a novel taxonomy for cataloging key design choices and clarifying suitable applications for each method. Apart from surveying MoErging research, we inventory software tools and applications that make use of MoErging. We additionally discuss related fields of study such as model merging, multitask learning, and mixture-of-experts models. Taken as a whole, our survey provides a unified overview of existing MoErging methods and creates a solid foundation for future work in this burgeoning field.

Abstract: We propose a new reinforcement learning (RL) formulation for training continuous-time score-based diffusion models for generative AI to generate samples that maximize reward functions while keeping the generated distributions close to the unknown target data distributions. Different from most existing studies, ours does not involve any pretrained model for the unknown score functions of the noise-perturbed data distributions, nor does it attempt to learn the score functions. Instead, we formulate the problem as entropy-regularized continuous-time RL and show that the optimal stochastic policy has a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance matrix. Based on this result, we parameterize the mean of Gaussian policies and develop an actor--critic type (little) q-learning algorithm to solve the RL problem. A key ingredient in our algorithm design is to obtain noisy observations from the unknown score function via a ratio estimator. Our formulation can also be adapted to solve pure score-matching and fine-tuning pretrained models. Numerically, we show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with two state-of-the-art RL methods that fine-tune pretrained models on several generative tasks including high-dimensional image generations. Finally, we discuss extensions of our RL formulation to probability flow ODE implementation of diffusion models and to conditional diffusion models.

Abstract: We present a new adaptation method MaCP, Minimal yet Mighty adaptive Cosine Projection, that achieves exceptional performance while requiring minimal parameters and memory for fine-tuning large foundation models. Its general idea is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation properties of cosine projection to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, it projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete cosine space. Then, the weight change is partitioned over different levels of the discrete cosine spectrum, and each partition's most critical frequency components are selected. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MaCP across a wide range of single-modality tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, text summarization, as well as multi-modality tasks such as image classification and video understanding. MaCP consistently delivers superior accuracy, significantly reduced computational complexity, and lower memory requirements compared to existing alternatives.

Abstract: Mobile traffic forecasting allows operators to anticipate network dynamics and performance in advance, offering substantial potential for enhancing service quality and improving user experience. However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.

Abstract: Identifying dynamical systems characterized by nonlinear parameters presents significant challenges in deriving mathematical models that enhance understanding of physics. Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing equations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the SINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of established approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This facilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and coefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise parameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear characteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or polynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an integrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown variables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification procedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions. The performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum of dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction kinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations (wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of concurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by nonlinear parameters. These findings highlight the potential of ADAM-SINDy to extend the applicability of the SINDy framework in addressing more complex challenges in dynamical system identification.

Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.

Abstract: Scientists and engineers use simulators to model empirically observed phenomena. However, tuning the parameters of a simulator to ensure its outputs match observed data presents a significant challenge. Simulation-based inference (SBI) addresses this by enabling Bayesian inference for simulators, identifying parameters that match observed data and align with prior knowledge. Unlike traditional Bayesian inference, SBI only needs access to simulations from the model and does not require evaluations of the likelihood function. In addition, SBI algorithms do not require gradients through the simulator, allow for massive parallelization of simulations, and can perform inference for different observations without further simulations or training, thereby amortizing inference. Over the past years, we have developed, maintained, and extended sbi, a PyTorch-based package that implements Bayesian SBI algorithms based on neural networks. The sbi toolkit implements a wide range of inference methods, neural network architectures, sampling methods, and diagnostic tools. In addition, it provides well-tested default settings, but also offers flexibility to fully customize every step of the simulation-based inference workflow. Taken together, the sbi toolkit enables scientists and engineers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods to black-box simulators, opening up new possibilities for aligning simulations with empirically observed data.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework to analyze memorization in diffusion models through the sharpness of the log probability density. We mathematically justify a previously proposed score-difference-based memorization metric by demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying sharpness. Additionally, we propose a novel memorization metric that captures sharpness at the initial stage of image generation in latent diffusion models, offering early insights into potential memorization. Leveraging this metric, we develop a mitigation strategy that optimizes the initial noise of the generation process using a sharpness-aware regularization term.

Abstract: Kernel-free quadratic surface support vector machines have recently gained traction due to their flexibility in modeling nonlinear decision boundaries without relying on kernel functions. However, the introduction of a full quadratic classifier significantly increases the number of model parameters, scaling quadratically with data dimensionality, which often leads to overfitting and makes interpretation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse variant of the QSVM by enforcing a cardinality constraint on the model parameters. While enhancing generalization and promoting sparsity, leveraging the $\ell_0$-norm inevitably incurs additional computational complexity. To tackle this, we develop a penalty decomposition algorithm capable of producing solutions that provably satisfy the first-order Lu-Zhang optimality conditions. Our approach accommodates both hinge and quadratic loss functions. In both cases, we demonstrate that the subproblems arising within the algorithm either admit closed-form solutions or can be solved efficiently through dual formulations, which contributes to the method's overall effectiveness. We also analyze the convergence behavior of the algorithm under both loss settings. Finally, we validate our approach on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to reduce overfitting while maintaining strong classification performance. The complete implementation and experimental code are publicly available at https://github.com/raminzandvakili/L0-QSVM.

Abstract: The notion of \emph{rank} of a Boolean function has been a cornerstone in PAC learning theory, enabling quasipolynomial-time learning algorithms for polynomial-size decision trees. We present a novel characterization of rank, grounded in the well-known Transformer architecture. We show that the rank of a function $f$ corresponds to the minimum number of \emph{Chain of Thought} (CoT) steps required by a single-layer Transformer with hard attention to compute $f$. Based on this characterization we establish tight bounds on the number of CoT steps required for specific problems, showing that \(\ell\)-fold function composition necessitates exactly \(\ell\) CoT steps. Furthermore, we analyze the problem of identifying the position of the \(k\)-th occurrence of 1 in a Boolean sequence, proving that it requires \(k\) CoT steps. Finally, we introduce the notion of the multi-head rank that captures multi-head single-layer transformers, and perform the analysis of PAC-learnability of the classes of functions with bounded multi-head rank.

The proposed method learns an Empirical Green's Function for the associated, but hidden, boundary value problem, in the form of a Rational Neural Network from which we subsequently construct a bivariate representation in a Chebyshev basis. We uncover the Green's function, at an unseen control parameter value, by interpolating the left and right singular functions within a suitable library, expressed as points on a manifold of Quasimatrices, while the associated singular values are interpolated with Lagrange polynomials.

Abstract: In multi-objective black-box optimization, the goal is typically to find solutions that optimize a set of $T$ black-box objective functions, $f_1$, ..., $f_T$, simultaneously. Traditional approaches often seek a single Pareto-optimal set that balances trade-offs among all objectives. In this work, we consider a problem setting that departs from this paradigm: finding a small set of K < T solutions, that collectively "covers" the T objectives. A set of solutions is defined as "covering" if, for each objective $f_1$, ..., $f_T$, there is at least one good solution. A motivating example for this problem setting occurs in drug design. For example, we may have T pathogens and aim to identify a set of K < T antibiotics such that at least one antibiotic can be used to treat each pathogen. To address this problem, we propose Multi-Objective Coverage Bayesian Optimization (MOCOBO), a principled algorithm designed to efficiently find a covering set. We validate our approach through experiments on challenging high-dimensional tasks, including applications in peptide and molecular design, where MOCOBO is shown to find high-performing covering sets of solutions. The results show that the coverage of the K < T solutions found by MOCOBO matches or nearly matches the coverage of T solutions obtained by optimizing each objective individually. Furthermore, in in vitro experiments, the peptides found by MOCOBO exhibited high potency against drug-resistant pathogens, further demonstrating the potential of MOCOBO for drug discovery. We make code available here: https://github.com/nataliemaus/mocobo.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed various manifestations of position bias in transformer architectures, from the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon to attention sinks, yet a comprehensive theoretical understanding of how attention masks and positional encodings shape these biases remains elusive. This paper presents a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing position bias in multi-layer attention. Modeling attention masks as directed graphs, we quantify how tokens interact with contextual information based on their sequential positions. We uncover two key insights: First, causal masking inherently biases attention toward earlier positions, as tokens in deeper layers attend to increasingly more contextualized representations of earlier tokens. Second, we characterize the competing effects of the causal mask and relative positional encodings, such as the decay mask and rotary positional encoding (RoPE): while both mechanisms introduce distance-based decay within individual attention maps, their aggregate effect across multiple attention layers$\unicode{x2013}$coupled with the causal mask$\unicode{x2013}$leads to a trade-off between the long-term decay effects and the cumulative importance of early sequence positions. Through controlled numerical experiments, we not only validate our theoretical findings but also reproduce position biases observed in real-world LLMs. Our framework offers a principled foundation for understanding positional biases in transformers, shedding light on the complex interplay of attention mechanism components and guiding more informed architectural design.

Abstract: Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose SG^2, an iterative Schema-Guided Scene-Graph reasoning framework based on multi-agent LLMs. The agents are grouped into two modules: a (1) Reasoner module for abstract task planning and graph information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever module for extracting corresponding graph information based on code-writing following the queries. Two modules collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. The scene graph schema, prompted to both modules, serves to not only streamline both reasoning and retrieval process, but also guide the cooperation between two modules. This eliminates the need to prompt LLMs with full graph data, reducing the chance of hallucination due to irrelevant information. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches and baseline single-agent, tool-based Reason-while-Retrieve strategy in numerical Q\&amp;A and planning tasks.

Abstract: Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) describe the evolution of random processes over space and time, but their solutions are often analytically intractable and computationally expensive to estimate. In this paper, we propose the Learned Expectation Collapser (LEC), a physics-informed neural framework designed to approximate the expected value of linear SPDE solutions without requiring domain discretization. By leveraging randomized sampling of both space-time coordinates and noise realizations during training, LEC trains standard feedforward neural networks to minimize residual loss across multiple stochastic samples. We hypothesize and empirically confirm that this training regime drives the network to converge toward the expected value of the solution of the SPDE. Using the stochastic heat equation as a testbed, we evaluate performance across a diverse set of 144 experimental configurations that span multiple spatial dimensions, noise models, and forcing functions. The results show that the model consistently learns accurate approximations of the expected value of the solution in lower dimensions and a predictable decrease in accuracy with increased spatial dimensions, with improved stability and robustness under increased Monte Carlo sampling. Our findings offer new insight into how neural networks implicitly learn statistical structure from stochastic differential operators and suggest a pathway toward scalable, simulator-free SPDE solvers.

Abstract: Digital twins have been actively explored in many engineering applications, such as manufacturing and autonomous systems. However, model discrepancy is ubiquitous in most digital twin models and has significant impacts on the performance of using those models. In recent years, data-driven modeling techniques have been demonstrated promising in characterizing the model discrepancy in existing models, while the training data for the learning of model discrepancy is often obtained in an empirical way and an active approach of gathering informative data can potentially benefit the learning of model discrepancy. On the other hand, Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a systematic approach to gathering the most informative data, but its performance is often negatively impacted by the model discrepancy. In this work, we build on sequential BED and propose an efficient approach to iteratively learn the model discrepancy based on the data from the BED. The performance of the proposed method is validated by a classical numerical example governed by a convection-diffusion equation, for which full BED is still feasible. The proposed method is then further studied in the same numerical example with a high-dimensional model discrepancy, which serves as a demonstration for the scenarios where full BED is not practical anymore. An ensemble-based approximation of information gain is further utilized to assess the data informativeness and to enhance learning model discrepancy. The results show that the proposed method is efficient and robust to the active learning of high-dimensional model discrepancy, using data suggested by the sequential BED. We also demonstrate that the proposed method is compatible with both classical numerical solvers and modern auto-differentiable solvers.

Abstract: The technique of ``testing by betting" frames nonparametric sequential hypothesis testing as a multiple-round game, where a player bets on future observations that arrive in a streaming fashion, accumulates wealth that quantifies evidence against the null hypothesis, and rejects the null once the wealth exceeds a specified threshold while controlling the false positive error. Designing an online learning algorithm that achieves a small regret in the game can help rapidly accumulate the bettor's wealth, which in turn can shorten the time to reject the null hypothesis under the alternative $H_1$. However, many of the existing works employ the Online Newton Step (ONS) to update within a halved decision space to avoid a gradient explosion issue, which is potentially conservative for rapid wealth accumulation. In this paper, we introduce a novel strategy utilizing interior-point methods in optimization that allows updates across the entire interior of the decision space without the risk of gradient explosion. Our approach not only maintains strong statistical guarantees but also facilitates faster null hypothesis rejection, while being as computationally lightweight as ONS thanks to its closed-form updates.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) enhances policies through direct interactions with the environment, but faces challenges related to sample efficiency. In contrast, offline RL leverages extensive pre-collected data to learn policies, but often produces suboptimal results due to limited data coverage. Recent efforts integrate offline and online RL in order to harness the advantages of both approaches. However, effectively combining online and offline RL remains challenging due to issues that include catastrophic forgetting, lack of robustness to data quality and limited sample efficiency in data utilization. In an effort to address these challenges, we introduce A3RL, which incorporates a novel confidence aware Active Advantage Aligned (A3) sampling strategy that dynamically prioritizes data aligned with the policy's evolving needs from both online and offline sources, optimizing policy improvement. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights into the effectiveness of our active sampling strategy and conduct diverse empirical experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating that our method outperforms competing online RL techniques that leverage offline data.

Abstract: From a variational perspective, many statistical learning criteria involve seeking a distribution that balances empirical risk and regularization. In this paper, we broaden this perspective by introducing a new general class of variational methods based on Fenchel-Young (FY) losses, treated as divergences that generalize (and encompass) the familiar Kullback-Leibler divergence at the core of classical variational learning. Our proposed formulation -- FY variational learning -- includes as key ingredients new notions of FY free energy, FY evidence, FY evidence lower bound, and FY posterior. We derive alternating minimization and gradient backpropagation algorithms to compute (or lower bound) the FY evidence, which enables learning a wider class of models than previous variational formulations. This leads to generalized FY variants of classical algorithms, such as an FY expectation-maximization (FYEM) algorithm, and latent-variable models, such as an FY variational autoencoder (FYVAE). Our new methods are shown to be empirically competitive, often outperforming their classical counterparts, and most importantly, to have qualitatively novel features. For example, FYEM has an adaptively sparse E-step, while the FYVAE can support models with sparse observations and sparse posteriors.

Abstract: We study memory-efficient optimization of neural networks (in particular language models) with linear gradient transformations, where the gradients are linearly mapped to a lower dimensional space than the full parameter space, thus saving memory required for gradient accumulation and optimizer state persistence. The model parameters are updated by first performing an optimization step in the lower dimensional space and then going back into the original parameter space via the linear map's transpose. We show that optimizing the model in this transformed space is equivalent to reparameterizing the original model through a linear adapter that additively modifies the model parameters, and then only optimizing the adapter's parameters. When the transformation is Kronecker-factored, this establishes an equivalence between GaLore and one-sided LoRA. We show that this duality between gradient transformations and adapter-based reparameterizations unifies existing approaches to memory-efficient training and suggests new techniques for improving training efficiency and memory use.

Abstract: A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching, and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.

Abstract: Understanding collective pedestrian movement is crucial for applications in crowd management, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction. This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically.
  We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.

Abstract: Geographic distribution shift arises when the distribution of locations on Earth in a training dataset is different from what is seen at test time. The most common approaches to tackling geographic distribution shift treat regions delimited by administrative boundaries such as countries or continents as separate domains and apply standard domain adaptation methods, ignoring geographic coordinates that are often available as metadata. This paper proposes the use of location encoders for modeling continuous, learnable domain assignment. We show how both non-parametric sine-cosine encoders and pre-trained location encoders can be used in conjunction with standard domain adaptation methods for improved robustness to geographic distribution shift. Our proposed methods achieve new state-of-the-art results on two geo-tagged remote sensing datasets from the WILDS benchmark. We have made our code publicly available at: https://github.com/crastoru/wilds-geoshift.

Abstract: Off-policy policy evaluation (OPE), an essential component of reinforcement learning, has long suffered from stationary state distribution mismatch, undermining both stability and accuracy of OPE estimates. While existing methods correct distribution shifts by estimating density ratios, they often rely on expensive optimization or backward Bellman-based updates and struggle to outperform simpler baselines. We introduce AVG-DICE, a computationally simple Monte Carlo estimator for the density ratio that averages discounted importance sampling ratios, providing an unbiased and consistent correction. AVG-DICE extends naturally to nonlinear function approximation using regression, which we roughly tune and test on OPE tasks based on Mujoco Gym environments and compare with state-of-the-art density-ratio estimators using their reported hyperparameters. In our experiments, AVG-DICE is at least as accurate as state-of-the-art estimators and sometimes offers orders-of-magnitude improvements. However, a sensitivity analysis shows that best-performing hyperparameters may vary substantially across different discount factors, so a re-tuning is suggested.

Abstract: Behavioral game theory models serve two purposes: yielding insights into how human decision-making works, and predicting how people would behave in novel strategic settings. A system called GameNet represents the state of the art for predicting human behavior in the setting of unrepeated simultaneous-move games, combining a simple "level-k" model of strategic reasoning with a complex neural network model of non-strategic "level-0" behavior. Although this reliance on well-established ideas from cognitive science ought to make GameNet interpretable, the flexibility of its level-0 model raises the possibility that it is able to emulate strategic reasoning. In this work, we prove that GameNet's level-0 model is indeed too general. We then introduce ElementaryNet, a novel neural network that is provably incapable of expressing strategic behavior. We show that these additional restrictions are empirically harmless, leading ElementaryNet to statistically indistinguishable predictive performance vs GameNet. We then show how it is possible to derive insights about human behavior by varying ElementaryNet's features and interpreting its parameters, finding evidence of iterative reasoning, learning about the depth of this reasoning process, and showing the value of a rich level-0 specification.

Abstract: Machine learning classification models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) often inadvertently rely on spurious correlations. When absent in the test data, these unintended associations between non-target attributes and target labels lead to poor generalization. This paper addresses this problem from a model optimization perspective and proposes a novel method, Gradient Extrapolation for Debiased Representation Learning (GERNE), designed to learn debiased representations in both known and unknown attribute training cases. GERNE uses two distinct batches with different amounts of spurious correlations and defines the target gradient as a linear extrapolation of the gradients computed from each batch's loss. Our analysis shows that when the extrapolated gradient points toward the batch gradient with fewer spurious correlations, it effectively guides training toward learning a debiased model. GERNE serves as a general framework for debiasing, encompassing ERM and Resampling methods as special cases. We derive the theoretical upper and lower bounds of the extrapolation factor employed by GERNE. By tuning this factor, GERNE can adapt to maximize either Group-Balanced Accuracy (GBA) or Worst-Group Accuracy (WGA). We validate GERNE on five vision and one NLP benchmarks, demonstrating competitive and often superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy; however, balancing privacy preservation (PP) and fairness poses significant challenges. In this paper, we present the first unified large-scale empirical study of privacy-fairness-utility trade-offs in FL, advancing toward responsible AI deployment. Specifically, we systematically compare Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) with fairness-aware optimizers including q-FedAvg, q-MAML, Ditto, evaluating their performance under IID and non-IID scenarios using benchmark (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) and real-world datasets (Alzheimer's MRI, credit-card fraud detection). Our analysis reveals HE and SMC significantly outperform DP in achieving equitable outcomes under data skew, although at higher computational costs. Remarkably, we uncover unexpected interactions: DP mechanisms can negatively impact fairness, and fairness-aware optimizers can inadvertently reduce privacy effectiveness. We conclude with practical guidelines for designing robust FL systems that deliver equitable, privacy-preserving, and accurate outcomes.

Abstract: We develop new uncertainty propagation methods for feed-forward neural network architectures with leaky ReLU activation functions subject to random perturbations in the input vectors. In particular, we derive analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the neural network output and its statistical moments as a function of the input uncertainty and the parameters of the network, i.e., weights and biases. A key finding is that an appropriate linearization of the leaky ReLU activation function yields accurate statistical results even for large perturbations in the input vectors. This can be attributed to the way information propagates through the network. We also propose new analytically tractable Gaussian copula surrogate models to approximate the full joint PDF of the neural network output. To validate our theoretical results, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations and a thorough error analysis on a multi-layer neural network representing a nonlinear integro-differential operator between two polynomial function spaces. Our findings demonstrate excellent agreement between the theoretical predictions and Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural context. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. This bidirectional and hierarchical (Bi-Hierarchical) fusion approach leverages the strengths of both modalities to capture richer and more comprehensive protein representations. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including enzyme EC classification, model quality assessment, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, protein-protein binding site prediction, and B cell epitopes prediction. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of Bi-Hierarchical Fusion in bridging sequence and structural modalities.

Abstract: Intelligent agents, such as robots, are increasingly deployed in real-world, human-centric environments. To foster appropriate human trust and meet legal and ethical standards, these agents must be able to explain their behavior. However, state-of-the-art agents are typically driven by black-box models like deep neural networks, limiting their interpretability. We propose a method for generating natural language explanations of agent behavior based only on observed states and actions -- without access to the agent's underlying model. Our approach learns a locally interpretable surrogate model of the agent's behavior from observations, which then guides a large language model to generate plausible explanations with minimal hallucination. Empirical results show that our method produces explanations that are more comprehensible and correct than those from baselines, as judged by both language models and human evaluators. Furthermore, we find that participants in a user study more accurately predicted the agent's future actions when given our explanations, suggesting improved understanding of agent behavior.

Abstract: The inference-time resource costs of large language and vision models present a growing challenge in production deployments. We propose the use of foundation model programs, i.e., programs that can invoke foundation models with varying resource costs and performance, as an approach to this problem. Specifically, we present a method that translates a task into a program, then learns a policy for resource allocation that, on each input, selects foundation model "backends" for each program module. The policy uses smaller, cheaper backends to handle simpler subtasks, while allowing more complex subtasks to leverage larger, more capable models. We evaluate the method on two new "streaming" visual question-answering tasks in which a system answers a question on a sequence of inputs, receiving ground-truth feedback after each answer. Compared to monolithic multi-modal models, our implementation achieves up to 98% resource savings with minimal accuracy loss, demonstrating its potential for scalable and resource-efficient multi-modal inference.

Abstract: Biosignals can be viewed as mixtures measuring particular physiological events, and blind source separation (BSS) aims to extract underlying source signals from mixtures. This paper proposes a self-supervised multi-encoder autoencoder (MEAE) to separate heartbeat-related source signals from photoplethysmogram (PPG), enhancing heart rate (HR) detection in noisy PPG data. The MEAE is trained on PPG signals from a large open polysomnography database without any pre-processing or data selection. The trained network is then applied to a noisy PPG dataset collected during the daily activities of nine subjects. The extracted heartbeat-related source signal significantly improves HR detection as compared to the original PPG. The absence of pre-processing and the self-supervised nature of the proposed method, combined with its strong performance, highlight the potential of MEAE for BSS in biosignal analysis.

Abstract: Numerical solvers for PDEs often struggle to balance computational cost with accuracy, especially in multiscale and time-dependent systems. Neural operators offer a promising way to accelerate simulations, but their practical deployment is hindered by several challenges: they typically require large volumes of training data generated from high-fidelity solvers, tend to accumulate errors over time in dynamical settings, and often exhibit poor generalization in multiphysics scenarios. This work introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates physics-informed deep operator network with FEM through domain decomposition and leverages numerical analysis for time marching. Our innovation lies in efficient coupling FE and DeepONet subdomains via a Schwarz method, expecting to solve complex and nonlinear regions by a pretrained DeepONet, while the remainder is handled by conventional FE. To address the challenges of dynamic systems, we embed a time stepping scheme directly into the DeepONet, substantially reducing long-term error propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive subdomain evolution strategy enables the ML-resolved region to expand dynamically, capturing fine-scale features without remeshing. Our framework shows accelerated convergence rates (up to 20% improvement in convergence rates compared to conventional FE coupling approaches) while preserving solution fidelity with error margins consistently below 3%. Our study shows that our proposed hybrid solver: (1) reduces computational costs by eliminating fine mesh requirements, (2) mitigates error accumulation in time-dependent simulations, and (3) enables automatic adaptation to evolving physical phenomena. This work establishes a new paradigm for coupling state of the art physics based and machine learning solvers in a unified framework, offering a robust, reliable, and scalable pathway for high fidelity multiscale simulations.

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

Abstract: Defining ocean regions and water masses helps to understand marine processes and can serve downstream tasks such as defining marine protected areas. However, such definitions often result from subjective decisions potentially producing misleading, unreproducible outcomes. Here, the aim was to objectively define regions of the North Atlantic through systematic comparison of clustering methods within the Native Emergent Manifold Interrogation (NEMI) framework (Sonnewald, 2023). About 300 million measured salinity, temperature, and oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentration values served as input for various clustering methods (k-Means, agglomerative Ward, and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) emphasised (dis-)similarities in the data while reducing dimensionality. Based on systematic validation of clustering methods and their hyperparameters using internal, external and relative validation techniques, results showed that UMAP-DBSCAN best represented the data. Strikingly, internal validation metrics proved systematically unreliable for comparing clustering methods. To address stochastic variability, 100 UMAP-DBSCAN clustering runs were conducted and aggregated following NEMI, yielding a final set of 321 clusters. Reproducibility was evaluated via ensemble overlap ($88.81\pm1.8\%$) and mean grid cell-wise uncertainty ($15.49\pm20\%$). Case studies of the Mediterranean Sea, deep Atlantic waters and Labrador Sea showed strong agreement with common water mass definitions. This study revealed a more detailed regionalisation compared to previous concepts such as the Longhurst provinces through systematic clustering method comparison. The applied method is objective, efficient and reproducible and will support future research on biogeochemical differences and changes in oceanic regions.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks permeate real-world applications, posing challenges in orchestrating multi-step reasoning across diverse knowledge domains. While existing approaches have been improved with iterative retrieval, they still struggle to identify and organize dynamic knowledge. To address this, we propose DualRAG, a synergistic dual-process framework that seamlessly integrates reasoning and retrieval. DualRAG operates through two tightly coupled processes: Reasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ) and progressive Knowledge Aggregation (pKA). They work in concert: as RaQ navigates the reasoning path and generates targeted queries, pKA ensures that newly acquired knowledge is systematically integrated to support coherent reasoning. This creates a virtuous cycle of knowledge enrichment and reasoning refinement. Through targeted fine-tuning, DualRAG preserves its sophisticated reasoning and retrieval capabilities even in smaller-scale models, demonstrating its versatility and core advantages across different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual-process approach substantially improves answer accuracy and coherence, approaching, and in some cases surpassing, the performance achieved with oracle knowledge access. These results establish DualRAG as a robust and efficient solution for complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Notably, current intelligent transportation systems rely heavily on accurate traffic forecasting and swift inference provision to make timely decisions. While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown benefits in modeling complex traffic dependencies, the existing GCN-based approaches cannot fully extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently in a complete manner, proven to yield less accurate results. Besides, as extracting multi-granular features across scales has been a promising strategy across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, pioneering studies have attempted to leverage a similar mechanism for spatiotemporal traffic data mining. However, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast forecasts. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by coordinating heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected GCN baselines.

Abstract: Traditional Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG) methods focus on learning domain-invariant features or adapting to unseen target domains, often overlooking the unique knowledge embedded within the source domain, especially in strictly isolated federated learning environments. Through experimentation, we discovered a counterintuitive phenomenon.: features learned from a complete source domain have superior generalization capabilities compared to those learned directly from the target domain. This insight leads us to propose the Federated Source Domain Awareness Framework (FedSDAF), the first systematic approach to enhance FedDG by leveraging source domain-aware features. FedSDAF employs a dual-adapter architecture that decouples "local expertise" from "global generalization consensus". A Domain-Aware Adapter, retained locally, extracts and protects the unique discriminative knowledge of each source domain, while a Domain-Invariant Adapter, shared across clients, builds a robust global consensus. To enable knowledge exchange, we introduce a Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation mechanism that facilitates efficient dialogue between the adapters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (OfficeHome, PACS, VLCS, DomainNet) show that FedSDAF significantly outperforms existing FedDG methods.The source code is available at https://github.com/pizzareapers/FedSDAF.

We introduce mAIstro, an open-source, autonomous multi-agentic framework for end-to-end development and deployment of medical AI models. The system orchestrates exploratory data analysis, radiomic feature extraction, image segmentation, classification, and regression through a natural language interface, requiring no coding from the user. Built on a modular architecture, mAIstro supports both open- and closed-source LLMs, and was evaluated using a large and diverse set of prompts across 16 open-source datasets, covering a wide range of imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and data types. The agents successfully executed all tasks, producing interpretable outputs and validated models.

Abstract: Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) balance task learning in Multi-Task Learning by addressing issues like conflicting gradients and differing gradient norms, which hinder equal-weighted task training. However, recent critiques suggest that equally weighted tasks can achieve competitive results compared to SMTOs, arguing that previous SMTO results were influenced by poor hyperparameter optimization and lack of regularization. In this work, we evaluate these claims through an extensive empirical evaluation of SMTOs, including some of the latest methods, on more complex multi-task problems to clarify this behavior. Our findings indicate that SMTOs perform well compared to uniform loss and that fixed weights can achieve competitive performance compared to SMTOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate why uniform loss perform similarly to SMTOs in some instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/Gabriel-SGama/UnitScal_vs_SMTOs.

Abstract: The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is a critical task in domains like healthcare and climate science. However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper studies the long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL) with distribution mismatch, where the class distribution of the labeled training data follows a long-tailed distribution and mismatches with that of the unlabeled training data. Most existing methods introduce auxiliary classifiers (experts) to model various unlabeled data distributions and produce pseudo-labels, but the expertises of various experts are not fully utilized. We observe that different experts are good at predicting different intervals of samples, e.g., long-tailed expert is skilled in samples located in the head interval and uniform expert excels in samples located in the medium interval. Therefore, we propose a dynamic expert assignment module that can estimate the class membership (i.e., head, medium, or tail class) of samples, and dynamically assigns suitable expert to each sample based on the estimated membership to produce high-quality pseudo-label in the training phase and produce prediction in the testing phase. We also theoretically reveal that integrating different experts' strengths will lead to a smaller generalization error bound. Moreover, we find that the deeper features are more biased toward the head class but with more discriminative ability, while the shallower features are less biased but also with less discriminative ability. We, therefore, propose a multi-depth feature fusion module to utilize different depth features to mitigate the model bias. Our method demonstrates its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT, and SVHN-LT datasets across various settings.

Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, fully quantized training (FQT) of large language models (LLMs) using predominantly 4-bit floating-point (FP4) precision for weights, activations, and gradients on datasets up to 200 billion tokens. We extensively investigate key design choices for FP4, including block sizes, scaling formats, and rounding methods. Our analysis shows that the NVFP4 format, where each block of 16 FP4 values (E2M1) shares a scale represented in E4M3, provides optimal results. We use stochastic rounding for backward and update passes and round-to-nearest for the forward pass to enhance stability. Additionally, we identify a theoretical and empirical threshold for effective quantized training: when the gradient norm falls below approximately $\sqrt{3}$ times the quantization noise, quantized training becomes less effective. Leveraging these insights, we successfully train a 7-billion-parameter model on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators. The resulting FP4-trained model achieves downstream task performance comparable to a standard BF16 baseline, confirming that FP4 training is a practical and highly efficient approach for large-scale LLM training. A reference implementation is supplied in https://github.com/Anonymous1252022/fp4-all-the-way .

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is effective but limited by reliance on costly, domain-specific supervision. We explore Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), a framework that enables LLMs to learn from intrinsic signals without external rewards or labeled data. We propose Intuitor, an RLIF method that uses a model's own confidence, termed self-certainty, as its sole reward signal. Intuitor replaces external rewards in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-certainty scores, enabling fully unsupervised learning. Experiments demonstrate that Intuitor matches GRPO's performance on mathematical benchmarks while achieving superior generalization to out-of-domain tasks like code generation, without requiring gold solutions or test cases. Our findings show that intrinsic model signals can drive effective learning across domains, offering a scalable alternative to RLVR for autonomous AI systems where verifiable rewards are unavailable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the \texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement in simulation accuracy.

Abstract: We present a new adaptation method MaCP, Minimal yet Mighty adaptive Cosine Projection, that achieves exceptional performance while requiring minimal parameters and memory for fine-tuning large foundation models. Its general idea is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation properties of cosine projection to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, it projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete cosine space. Then, the weight change is partitioned over different levels of the discrete cosine spectrum, and each partition's most critical frequency components are selected. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MaCP across a wide range of single-modality tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, text summarization, as well as multi-modality tasks such as image classification and video understanding. MaCP consistently delivers superior accuracy, significantly reduced computational complexity, and lower memory requirements compared to existing alternatives.

Abstract: We introduce TimeMCL, a method leveraging the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) paradigm to forecast multiple plausible time series futures. Our approach employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to promote diversity among predictions. MCL has recently gained attention due to its simplicity and ability to address ill-posed and ambiguous tasks. We propose an adaptation of this framework for time-series forecasting, presenting it as an efficient method to predict diverse futures, which we relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series, demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs. This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer (MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE) layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains. This work is open-sourced at https://github.com/YichenLuo-0/MMET.

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally, the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises. Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical evaluation of various clustering tasks.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles. BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances. Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning; Behavior Cloning; Lipschitz Neural Network

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop OptScale, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. OptScale employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that OptScale significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance. Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Abstract: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data and labels to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops an activation shortcut that transmits only the token involved in the loss calculation instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data and labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate PAE MobiLLM's superiority.

Abstract: Existing generative models for time series forecasting often transform simple priors (typically Gaussian) into complex data distributions. However, their sampling initialization, independent of historical data, hinders the capture of temporal dependencies, limiting predictive accuracy. They also treat residuals merely as optimization targets, ignoring that residuals often exhibit meaningful patterns like systematic biases or nontrivial distributional structures. To address these, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM), a novel model-agnostic framework that extends flow matching by integrating outputs from an auxiliary predictive model. This enables learning from the probabilistic structure of prediction residuals, leveraging the auxiliary model's prediction distribution as a source to reduce learning difficulty and refine forecasts. CGFM incorporates historical data as both conditions and guidance, uses two-sided conditional paths (with source and target conditioned on the same history), and employs affine paths to expand the path space, avoiding path crossing without complex mechanisms, preserving temporal consistency, and strengthening distribution alignment. Experiments across datasets and baselines show CGFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, advancing forecasting.

Abstract: We introduce a novel classification framework, ZClassifier, that replaces conventional deterministic logits with diagonal Gaussian-distributed logits. Our method simultaneously addresses temperature scaling and manifold approximation by minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted Gaussian distributions and a unit isotropic Gaussian. This unifies uncertainty calibration and latent control in a principled probabilistic manner, enabling a natural interpretation of class confidence and geometric consistency. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ZClassifier improves over softmax classifiers in robustness, calibration, and latent separation, with consistent benefits across small-scale and large-scale classification settings.

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time, freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al. (arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the $O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret, exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise all of our results to compact state spaces.

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform. However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings. Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

Abstract: Measles, a highly contagious disease declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of successful vaccination campaigns, resurged in 2025, with 1,356 confirmed cases reported as of August 5, 2025. Given its rapid spread among susceptible individuals, fast and reliable diagnostic systems are critical for early prevention and containment. In this work, we applied transfer learning to fine-tune a pretrained Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model for distinguishing measles rashes from other skin conditions. Trained on a diverse, curated skin rash image dataset, the DeiT model achieved a median classification accuracy of 96.38%, precision of 96.24%, recall of 96.38%, and an F1-score of 96.23%, demonstrating high effectiveness in accurate detection to aid outbreak control. We also compared the DeiT model with a convolutional neural network, ResNet-50, and discussed the directions for future research.
